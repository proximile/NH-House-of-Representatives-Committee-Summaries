00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
five-term state legislator who is chair
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
of this committee and I'm here this
 
00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 align:start position:0%
morning to introduce House Bill 609
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
a reform of the site evaluation
 
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.850 align:start position:0%
a reform of the site evaluation
committee

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 in 2021 and Senate Bill
 
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
this legislative body convened two study
 
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
committees to study the site evaluation
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
committee and its operation
 
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
now the site evaluation committee has
 
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
been around for a long time over 20
 
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
years it has been reformed several times
 
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
during the course of that 20 years
 
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 align:start position:0%
and those reforms while they have helped
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
continued to produce
 
00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 align:start position:0%
limited results from the site evaluation
 
00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:04.070 align:start position:0%
limited results from the site evaluation
committee

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
the study committees that I sat on
 
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
in 2021 and 2022
 
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
provided almost unanimous testimony
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
that the site Opera the site evaluation
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee operation was slow
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
there were very few people who testified
 
00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:37.139 align:start position:0%
that the process worked well everybody
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
had issues with the way the site
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
so the study committees both determined
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
both filed reports which you can view on
 
00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
the general court website on the House
 
00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:54.710 align:start position:0%
the general court website on the House
website

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
both those reports indicated that
 
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
additional reforms
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
would likely be needed
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
to streamline the operation of the site
 
00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:06.419 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
the result of the second of those two
 
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
reports Senate Bill 256 study committee
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
report is House Bill 609 which you see
 
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
now I'll be talking about this bill
 
00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
this morning in general terms
 
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
I have passed out to everyone on the
 
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.510 align:start position:0%
I have passed out to everyone on the
committee

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:35.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
2023-0769 H
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
an amendment that I will be proposing
 
00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
as is usually the case with
 
00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:53.459 align:start position:0%
large bills of this sort
 
00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:56.339 align:start position:0%
when you introduce the bill in
 
00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:58.550 align:start position:0%
when you introduce the bill in
November

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
November
 
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
you get a lot of response and a lot of
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
feedback on it
 
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.490 align:start position:0%
feedback on it
and

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
I have Incorporated that response and
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
feedback into the amendment
 
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
that we will
 
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
obviously we'll have
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
quite a few days
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
in the interim to reflect on
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment itself
 
00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
but if you have specific questions for
 
00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
me this morning
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
I will answer them by using the language
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
in the amendment rather than the
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
language in the introduced version of
 
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
but before we get to that let's talk in
 
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
general terms about
 
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
general terms about
why

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
this bill has even been introduced to
 
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
you've all heard the saying that time is
 
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.710 align:start position:0%
you've all heard the saying that time is
money

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
in the business world that's certainly
 
00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:59.750 align:start position:0%
in the business world that's certainly
true

00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
when a energy project gets proposed
 
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
and needs to be cited and approved
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
the longer time it takes to get that
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
project approved the more costly it will
 
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.130 align:start position:0%
project approved the more costly it will
be

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
and those costs are typically passed on
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
to those of us who will eventually
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
enjoy the rewards of the
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
so it's imperative that the site
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
evaluation process
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
be done in as efficient a manner as
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
possible to keep its costs as low as
 
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.590 align:start position:0%
possible to keep its costs as low as
possible

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
now the previous site evaluation
 
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
committee legislation the existing
 
00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
has a lot of excellent
 
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.170 align:start position:0%
has a lot of excellent
process

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
information in it
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
so as a result
 
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
what we did was we essentially moved the
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee process
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
from a separate committee
 
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
into the responsibilities of the Public
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission
 
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
but that move was made by essentially
 
00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
copying RSA 162h
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
into a new chapter that will appear
 
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.910 align:start position:0%
into a new chapter that will appear
under

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.230 align:start position:0%
under
the

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:44.420 align:start position:0%
duties and operations
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
statutes for the Public Utilities
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
Commission that new chapter will be
 
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
if you were to sit down with RSA 162-h
 
00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.230 align:start position:0%
if you were to sit down with RSA 162-h
and

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
and read them side by side what you
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
would discover is that
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
their practically identical they're very
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is that the
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
processes that have been developed over
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
the years in 162-h were good processes
 
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
and so all those good processes were
 
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.130 align:start position:0%
and so all those good processes were
preserved

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
preserved
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
the one thing that wasn't working
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
particularly well for this site
 
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee was the fact that
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
it was a separate
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
part-time committee
 
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
that was comprised of a lot of different
 
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.110 align:start position:0%
that was comprised of a lot of different
members

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
who had a difficult time
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
that's the root of the inefficiency of
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation process as it exists
 
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.970 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation process as it exists
today

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
and some folks who will testify after me
 
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
of course the site evaluation process
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
also has
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of institutional
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
knowledge because of the turnover of the
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee and its
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
existing form
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
there's sparse technical expertise
 
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
there are jurisdictional ambiguities in
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
the existing law
 
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of funding
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
and a lack of dedicated support staff
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of definition of the role
 
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
of the public Council and the
 
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.030 align:start position:0%
of the public Council and the
administrator

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
there's weak enforcement of
 
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:03.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
these are some of the issues that hb609
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
one of the big objections that
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
have surfaced since the introduction of
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:26.459 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
the idea that somehow hb609
 
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
shuts off or reduces public input into
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:40.820 align:start position:0%
but if you look closely at the sections
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
of the statute
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
that exists today
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
and examine those side by side
 
00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
with what's in House Bill 609 you
 
00:14:59.689 --> 00:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
the same amount of input that the public
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
has today to a site evaluation project
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
will be available under hb609
 
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
the only difference will be that instead
 
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
of a separate nine-member committee
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
making final decisions about the
 
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
viability of a project
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
those decisions will be made by the
 
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
professional staff at the Public
 
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
the professional staff at the puc
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
knows regulatory processes they've been
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
doing this for decades
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
they have a well-established process
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
three full-time Commissioners and
 
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
full-time staff on board to support
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
the work and the activity of the
 
00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:53.329 align:start position:0%
the work and the activity of the
commission

00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:56.339 align:start position:0%
moving the site evaluation process from
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
a separate committee
 
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
to the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
will professionalize the site evaluation
 
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.430 align:start position:0%
will professionalize the site evaluation
process

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
it will make it more timely more
 
00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:12.590 align:start position:0%
it will make it more timely more
efficient

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
and over time the accumulated
 
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:17.459 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge of the
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
commission and its staff
 
00:16:23.689 --> 00:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
will be able to streamline the process
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
to the point
 
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
that energy citing projects
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
we'll move through the process much more
 
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
now as I indicated when I opened this
 
00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
meeting there's over 20 people who
 
00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on this issue
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to
 
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
wrap up my testimony
 
00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:53.459 align:start position:0%
here so that other people can have a
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
chance to weigh in with their opinions
 
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
on this legislation
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
and of course I'll be happy to take
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
questions before I turn the floor over
 
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
to other speakers
 
00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vose
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
do I see any questions I do uh
 
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question chairman Vose
 
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:24.140 align:start position:0%
I actually did compare
 
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
hb609 and RSA 162-h side by side and I
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
highlighted where they differ and one
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
place that I noticed they differ is that
 
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
the current statute mentions renewable
 
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
energy in a few places and hb609 at
 
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
least the version that I read last night
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
does not in fact the word renewable does
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
not appear anywhere in there and I'm
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can speak to that
 
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.930 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can speak to that
please

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
yes the energy sighting process should
 
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
be technology neutral
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's not about deciding that this
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
technology should be cited versus that
 
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
technology should not be cited it's
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
about deciding
 
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.270 align:start position:0%
about deciding
how

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
whatever technology is proposed should
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
be cited
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
so any unnecessary references to
 
00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:18.539 align:start position:0%
renewable technology were removed in the
 
00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:20.150 align:start position:0%
renewable technology were removed in the
rewrite

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
rewrite
 
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.850 align:start position:0%
rewrite
well

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
although I do notice that in in the in
 
00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
the bill it does mention certain
 
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
Technologies in particular with
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
application fees and again renewable is
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe that's true
 
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
I know in the
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
if you go to page eight
 
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
application fees being twelve hundred
 
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
dollars per megawatt for the first 40
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
megawatts eighteen hundred dollars per
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
megawatt for each megawatt in excessive
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
40 megawatts for wind energy and solar
 
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
energy systems
 
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.090 align:start position:0%
energy systems
amen

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
so this would be an the amendment hb609
 
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
that I passed out earlier page eight
 
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.250 align:start position:0%
that I passed out earlier page eight
lines

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
six and seven
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative Thomas Winnie Thomas
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
Douglas Thomas
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
um as long as we're talking about those
 
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
fees on page eight whether it's in the
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
original bill or the amendment are you
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
suggesting now that Doe grabs all of
 
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:51.299 align:start position:0%
these fees do they go directly to doe
 
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
with this bill now
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.289 align:start position:0%
 
section

00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:03.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry are you referring to the
 
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
amendment or 609 yes I'm always going to
 
00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:09.299 align:start position:0%
refer to the amendment even though we
 
00:20:15.409 --> 00:20:15.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:20.299 align:start position:0%
if you look at page 13 line 34
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
363 D colon 18 fund established
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
there is hereby established in the
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
Office of the State Treasurer or
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing special fund to be known as
 
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
the energy facility sighting fund
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
all application fees and other filing
 
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:39.140 align:start position:0%
fees received by the commission under
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
d10 shall be deposited in the fund all
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
monies in the fund shall be continually
 
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the department offset
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
operating costs of the department or
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
commission arising from this chapter Etc
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
so that is where the money goes
 
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:57.059 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes so essentially it's in a
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
fund in the treasurer's office but the
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
doe has complete access to it is that
 
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.169 align:start position:0%
doe has complete access to it is that
correct

00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:06.059 align:start position:0%
yes the commission and the department
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:20.930 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
um I was looking at the makeup of the
 
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
current uh SEC and noticed that there
 
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
are representatives from the Department
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
of Business and economic Affairs the
 
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
resources department of transportation
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
these all seem like important voices to
 
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
consider and and have
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
as part of the decision-making Authority
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
for project citing will
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
will they also be incorporated in this
 
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
new SEC or how will we ensure that those
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
points of view are
 
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
given a seat at the table with decision
 
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
making capacity
 
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's a good
 
00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:00.059 align:start position:0%
one so
 
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
there's two different components here
 
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
that you have to consider one is people
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
who provide information to the decision
 
00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
makers the other is the decision makers
 
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
the Departments that you mentioned
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
which will no longer be part of the
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
decision-making body
 
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
are still important people to provide
 
00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
information as interveners or other
 
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
participants in the adjudicative process
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
that will result
 
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
from the passage of hb609
 
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
the only difference is
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
the final adjudication will be made by
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
the three members of the commission
 
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
not by members of a much larger body
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
with Lexus less expertise
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
and less time to devote to uh
 
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.909 align:start position:0%
and less time to devote to uh
analyzing

00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
analyzing
 
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
the issues involved in the whole
 
00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:06.299 align:start position:0%
I'll take well one more question from
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
someone who hasn't asked it yet before I
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
asked mine representative Noel
 
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
my question in moving the site
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee to the Department
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
of energy does the department of energy
 
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
gain any adjudicatory responsibilities
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
in that move or is that all handled by
 
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's all
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
handled by the puc the does role here
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
will be administrative and they will
 
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:36.980 align:start position:0%
play an important role in
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
compliance with the terms of an issued
 
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.470 align:start position:0%
compliance with the terms of an issued
certificate

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
and complaint resolution complaint
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
investigation and resolution that's the
 
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
role that the department will play
 
00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:54.620 align:start position:0%
and the commission will handle all
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
adjudicative legal issues okay thank you
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
okay we have a lot of speakers here I
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
will ask one more question I will ask a
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
question that you certainly may defer to
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
to some of the upcoming parties if you
 
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
wish but my question is uh I have heard
 
00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.570 align:start position:0%
wish but my question is uh I have heard
that

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:16.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
investors for energy projects
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
particularly those that would be
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
receiving the new funding from the
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
federal government with the
 
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Bill uh are could be
 
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
shying away from the state and some of
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
the monies that are being currently
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
fished out to other states are because
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
they have a much faster uh
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
citing process and they look at New
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as being very slow in
 
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.930 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as being very slow in
cumbersome

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:46.940 align:start position:0%
cumbersome
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
can thus they're not coming here and
 
00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:51.539 align:start position:0%
we're not getting the money for it can
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
my comment would simply be and thank you
 
00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
for the question that
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
everybody who testified before the
 
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
site evaluation study committees
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
indicated that the process is too slow
 
00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:12.059 align:start position:0%
to too cumbersome too inefficient
 
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
if that results in us getting fewer
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
federal dollars
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
then we need to fix that and that's what
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
hb609 will do
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that question thank you
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
senior representative McWilliams did
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
have a question well I'm sorry go ahead
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
Nick Williams
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair and chair
 
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.649 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair and chair
um

00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
so right now the Public Utilities
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
Commission has a full docket and is
 
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
often running months sometimes years
 
00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
behind on some decisions how would they
 
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
fit this site evaluation committee time
 
00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.059 align:start position:0%
requirement into their already busy
 
00:25:48.059 --> 00:25:50.930 align:start position:0%
requirement into their already busy
schedule

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
so the chair of the Public Utilities
 
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
Commission testified before our study
 
00:25:58.690 --> 00:25:58.700 align:start position:0%
committee the two SB 256 study committee
 
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
and he assured us that the commission's
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
schedule and workload could accommodate
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee work there
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
is a provision in the legislation or the
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that I handed out earlier to
 
00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.990 align:start position:0%
amendment that I handed out earlier to
augment

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
augment
 
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
the support staff for the commission and
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
the department to handle the the tasks
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
required by House Bill 609
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you chairman Vose I
 
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
think we will move on now to our next
 
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
speaker uh is Mr Drew Beamer from the
 
00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:45.549 align:start position:0%
speaker uh is Mr Drew Beamer from the
SEC

00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
chairman please turn on the microphone
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:15.419 align:start position:0%
chairman Vos and members of the
 
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
to be here today and give input on House
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 609 regarding SEC reform
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunately commissioner goldner is
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
unable to attend as he is an apuc
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
hearing at the moment
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
I would also like to thank the SEC study
 
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
committee whose diligent work has taken
 
00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
a complex issue
 
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
and distilled it into a more clear and
 
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
concise legislative proposal
 
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
while I have faith in the legislature to
 
00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
determine the specifics of the process
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
moving forward I am quite adamant that
 
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
whatever process we employ should be
 
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
very clear upfront and transparent
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
uncertainty in the permitting phase
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
elicits hesitance in developers which in
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
turn has slowed down new proposals
 
00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
particularly renewable generation in the
 
00:28:03.659 --> 00:28:06.710 align:start position:0%
particularly renewable generation in the
state

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
accordingly other states and regions are
 
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
benefiting disproportionately from
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
incentives set aside for grid
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
modernization and renewable energy
 
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.490 align:start position:0%
modernization and renewable energy
development

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
development
 
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
the process can be easy or hard long or
 
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
short however the complexity or duration
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
of permitting
 
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
while important is not the main
 
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
strategic choke point
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
the main roadblock is uncertainty in the
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
process itself
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
uncertainty which I am confident this
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
bill can and will sufficiently address
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
we must also ensure that we give due
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
weight to public input
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
and that all stakeholders are afforded
 
00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:48.059 align:start position:0%
their rightful place at the table
 
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
finally we should Endeavor to make this
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
process more resilient
 
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
the choices made here will impact future
 
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
administrators staff and puc
 
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and while I am personally
 
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
a staunch Defender
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
of legislative intent
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
I believe that guard rails are essential
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
to ensure that that intent
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
your intent
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
endures through subsequent
 
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.490 align:start position:0%
endures through subsequent
Administrations

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
Administrations
 
00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:18.179 align:start position:0%
I believe this bill sufficiently
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
addresses these issues and I'm happy to
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
support it on behalf of myself the SEC
 
00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:27.299 align:start position:0%
and commissioner Dan goldner
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
thank you and I look forward to your
 
00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:29.750 align:start position:0%
thank you and I look forward to your
questions

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Wendy
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
 
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to speak to the original
 
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
bill because we have not accepted the
 
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
amendment yet on page eight where we
 
00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
talk about the fees again can you
 
00:29:53.049 --> 00:29:53.059 align:start position:0%
explain to me why the price per megawatt
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
for any kind of renewable is 10 times
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
that of any for uh any non-renewable
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
I am looking at page eight
 
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
starting at line six twelve hundred for
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
megawatts these are fees uh for wind
 
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
energy and
 
00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
the amendment also includes solar but um
 
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
for any wind energy system
 
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
um at present I believe there was no
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
additional per megawatt fee for solar
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
generation there's just an upfront
 
00:30:27.649 --> 00:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
application fee of sixty thousand
 
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
dollars no my question is I'm sorry my
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
question is why is that twelve hundred
 
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
dollars per megawatt however it's 120
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
per megawatt for natural gas oh um it's
 
00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:42.299 align:start position:0%
I believe it is 1200 per megawatt for
 
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
the first 40 megawatts of any generation
 
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm just I'm just curious can
 
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
you explain why there's such a price
 
00:30:59.330 --> 00:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
I can explain that under currently
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
constructed there's usually an incentive
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
to charge renewable generation sources
 
00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
less for instance the price for nuclear
 
00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:12.059 align:start position:0%
I know is higher the price for wind is
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
lower and
 
00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:14.630 align:start position:0%
lower and
um

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
but I do not have an answer as to why
 
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
this particular fee structure was
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
constructed this way thank you I
 
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:26.750 align:start position:0%
constructed this way thank you I
apologize

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
further questions for Mr Beamer from the
 
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.409 align:start position:0%
further questions for Mr Beamer from the
committee

00:31:30.409 --> 00:31:30.419 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.169 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
under this bill and potentially under
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
the amendment should be adopted
 
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
is there any difference at all in your
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
mind as to either the influence or the
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
number of public
 
00:31:59.510 --> 00:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
inputs that would be able to be put
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
before the SEC for any project
 
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
I believe the public input would remain
 
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
the same there are multiple Avenues by
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
which to express public input the first
 
00:32:12.049 --> 00:32:12.059 align:start position:0%
and most convenient of which is directly
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
communicating with myself the
 
00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
administrator we process a presently not
 
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
high but certainly can be high
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
amount of comments public exhibits
 
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
public testimonies that are submitted in
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
advance of public hearings as to give
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
the committee members and subcommittee
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
members sufficient time to actually read
 
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
them before the hearing begins
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
um normally what I will do is impose an
 
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
administrative deadline on submission of
 
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
testimony and Exhibits of about one week
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
before hearing the reason for doing that
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
is I want to make sure that all the
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee members have an opportunity to
 
00:32:51.409 --> 00:32:51.419 align:start position:0%
read all the comments and all the um
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
exhibits that will be presented then at
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
the actual hearing itself
 
00:32:58.970 --> 00:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
it is a pub leaves these are all public
 
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
deliberations and the members of the
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
public have and will continue to have
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to participate
 
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
um through either
 
00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:08.470 align:start position:0%
um through either
um

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
statuses interveners or just status as
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.370 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:33:18.169 --> 00:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you for the follow-up
 
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
so would
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
assuming that we uh adopt the amendment
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh in this bill as well would this
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
process be any better or the same as
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
most other States's citing processes I
 
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
would bring us closer to congruent with
 
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
other states citing processes that's for
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
sure one of the main things that's
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
different about our process is the SEC
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
has currently constructed includes
 
00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.389 align:start position:0%
has currently constructed includes
multiple

00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
um commissioners of different
 
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.029 align:start position:0%
um commissioners of different
departments

00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
and also multiple public members the
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
issue with the commissioners of the
 
00:33:59.810 --> 00:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
Departments while well intended
 
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
certainly to have diversity of opinion
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
um it manifests itself in those folks
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
who have full-time jobs are unable to
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
attend so they appoint designees so
 
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
really the site evaluation committee
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
oftentimes is comprised of designees of
 
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and then in the instance
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
of the public members I have had times
 
00:34:24.169 --> 00:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
when I've needed to get a public member
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
to establish a quorum and they were
 
00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
unreachable for whatever reason because
 
00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
they have their own life or it was you
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
know over the holidays or they were on
 
00:34:32.879 --> 00:34:34.310 align:start position:0%
know over the holidays or they were on
vacation

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
vacation
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
um so the the main thing
 
00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
um with me at this point in time that I
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
believe this bill fixes
 
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
is that it makes the adjudicative
 
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
process a lot more simple by shepherding
 
00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:50.339 align:start position:0%
these sorts of issues to a panel the the
 
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:53.339 align:start position:0%
puc of people who were specifically
 
00:34:56.089 --> 00:34:56.099 align:start position:0%
nominated and confirmed based on their
 
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh having served on a
 
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
large number of uh site evaluation
 
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
committees in the past one of the
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
reoccurring problems that was never
 
00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:16.220 align:start position:0%
really able to address well is
 
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
post-construction or post issuing of a
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
permit where problems arose there was a
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
number of various places where buildings
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
were put where they weren't supposed to
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
and so forth and so on does this
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
adequately now address so that there's a
 
00:35:31.609 --> 00:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
follow-up a place where people can come
 
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
to and say I'm having a problem with the
 
00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:35.339 align:start position:0%
way it's being built I don't think
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
they're following their permit or even
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
the permit D that has to come back and
 
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
say we found something we didn't expect
 
00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:44.099 align:start position:0%
we need to amend a permit does this
 
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
adequately address those issues I
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
believe so because the current follow-up
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
and enforcement of compliance is
 
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:53.579 align:start position:0%
difficult under the current construction
 
00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
because what it entails is it entails um
 
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
basically me to investigate or appoint
 
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
somebody as a proxy on be on my behalf
 
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
so we'll convene a sub committee for the
 
00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
issue the subcommittee will say we're
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
either going to hire a firm to
 
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
investigate or going to find the
 
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
appropriate person in state government
 
00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
to investigate based on resources
 
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
available under the new legislation I
 
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
believe what would happen is all of that
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
investigative stuff and enforcement of
 
00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:23.339 align:start position:0%
compliance would be sent over to the doe
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
and the doe has sufficient staff
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
resources and subject matter expertise
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
to to adjudicate and investigate these
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
complaints in a more timely manner then
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams has a question
 
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.470 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams has a question
sure

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.130 align:start position:0%
sure
um

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
work when you're when you're looking at
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
an applicant how do you determine that
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
their financials are sufficient
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
for financing of the project yes that's
 
00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
an excellent question I
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know that there
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
presently is a
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
system to determine the financial health
 
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
of the applicant
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
okay if that's if that was the question
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I there's a way to
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
determine how many fees they have to pay
 
00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
um no whether they're capable of
 
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
actually producing the project oh well
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of those things
 
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:22.140 align:start position:0%
um will come out during the SEC process
 
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
there was um you know there are
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
different phases to the application
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
process and you know as was demonstrated
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
in um the most recent very large project
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
there was the Northern Pass project
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
obviously is a lot of these things will
 
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
come up over the course of the
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
permitting phase through uh the site
 
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee itself asking
 
00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:44.660 align:start position:0%
specific questions to that effect
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so just to
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
understand this I know in the past we've
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
had applicants who had incomplete
 
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
applications and that tends to drag the
 
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
process on and on is there anything
 
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
under this new proposal that would
 
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
require a complete applicant in order to
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
move to the next steps
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
I believe that you do in fact have to
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
have a complete application to move
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
forward under the new proposal that's my
 
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you
 
00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
and your your concern is warranted that
 
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
has happened multiple times
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
um you just stated that the doe has the
 
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
staff to adjudicate
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
um however every time we hear a bill
 
00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:29.339 align:start position:0%
that changes anything we hear from the
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
doe that they need to hire new staff to
 
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
accomplish it the fiscal note has not
 
00:38:38.089 --> 00:38:38.099 align:start position:0%
been introduced even though the last
 
00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:41.099 align:start position:0%
we've heard was January 10th are you
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
confident that the doe has the staff to
 
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
adjudicate these I am personally
 
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
confident but that question may better
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
be directed to a doe representative a
 
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:53.579 align:start position:0%
little later on thank you
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
okay I'd remind members that we have
 
00:38:59.290 --> 00:38:59.300 align:start position:0%
over 20 pink cards to get through so
 
00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:02.339 align:start position:0%
try to aim your questions very
 
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
specifically at someone who can answer
 
00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.270 align:start position:0%
specifically at someone who can answer
them

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank you Mr Beamer for
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you and I'd like
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
the next call on Mr Chris Elms and Mr
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
David chulock from the Department of
 
00:39:12.599 --> 00:39:25.790 align:start position:0%
David chulock from the Department of
energy

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
good morning gentlemen
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
don't forget to turn on the mic good
 
00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
morning and uh yeah I think you know I
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
can talk fast so I'll try to try to do
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
so uh for the record my name is Chris
 
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
Elms I'm the Deputy Commissioner of the
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy I'm
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
joined uh by David schulock who's the
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
general counsel uh at the department uh
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
we want to thank you for the opportunity
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
to testify this morning uh in support of
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 609 we are happy to join our
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues from the office of the
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate from the puc and the
 
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
SEC and the Department of Environmental
 
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
Services and supporting the bill
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know currently the department has
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
very little statutory responsibility
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
related to the citing process however uh
 
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
given the fact that New Hampshire has
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
energy needs that we have to meet while
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
minimizing impacts the ability to have
 
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
an effective citing process is of keen
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
interest to us
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
we talked about a citing in the 10-year
 
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
State energy strategy
 
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
which states that delivering appropriate
 
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
energy infrastructure requires
 
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
predictability defined processes good
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%
communication and clear standards for
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
achievement you know I I think others
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
you've heard from representative Vos
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
from from Mr Beamer you'll hear from
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
others on some of
 
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
you know those inefficiencies and
 
00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
challenges that are apparent in the
 
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
current process you know it's clear to
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
me based on some of the stakeholder
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
input we've heard over the last few
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
study committees through
 
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
um you know public hearings we've had on
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
other pieces of legislation that we we
 
00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
are not achieving those goals now uh and
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
and that we have an opportunity with
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
this bill to to improve our process
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
we've now participated in in two
 
00:41:08.329 --> 00:41:08.339 align:start position:0%
separate study committees and I think
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
David here has attended just about every
 
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.990 align:start position:0%
David here has attended just about every
meeting

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
um we've had a wealth of feedback from
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
interest from interested stakeholders in
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
the public and that's reflected in house
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
bill 609. this is a bipartisan bill and
 
00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:23.579 align:start position:0%
it's a result of that input and that
 
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
collaboration it's a common sense reform
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
this bill is not picking any side it's
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
just saying that regardless of what
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
technology or fuel type or whatever we
 
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
need the citing process to be effective
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
in determining whether or not a project
 
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:38.339 align:start position:0%
is right for New Hampshire
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
so look at the end of the day this bill
 
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
is not really a radical
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
departure from the current system most
 
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
of the existing statute is transferred
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
over is updated to new venues in state
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
government but it preserves many of the
 
00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
the various citing requirements and and
 
00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
public inputs
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and and in some cases you know
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
strengthens the ability for the public
 
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
to be confident that their voice is
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
being heard
 
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
these reforms are likely to add
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
substantial administrative efficiencies
 
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
making the process more professional
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
making the jurisdictions more clear
 
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
um you know through the clarified role
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
of the state agencies through the
 
00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:19.820 align:start position:0%
greater consistency of the knowledgeable
 
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
of knowledgeable membership uh of the
 
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and you know
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
the ability to ensure that voices are
 
00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:29.579 align:start position:0%
heard applicants will have a much more
 
00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:32.099 align:start position:0%
predictable sense of the likelihood of
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
success of their application or a much
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
more predictable sense of what
 
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
conditions and standards they're going
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
to have to meet in order to make sure
 
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
that their project is right for New
 
00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:45.349 align:start position:0%
that their project is right for New
Hampshire

00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.569 --> 00:42:47.579 align:start position:0%
with all the federal money that's that's
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
the the spending that's um come through
 
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
and with you know Technologies
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
um becoming more viable becoming more
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
cost effective
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know and frankly with some of the
 
00:43:01.609 --> 00:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
challenges that we're facing when it
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
comes to reliability and resource
 
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
adequacy we are facing a real
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make sure that we have
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
resources that are able to come into New
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that we're not squandering
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
those those uh opportunities to have
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
more cost-effective resources
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
um to have better and more viable
 
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.430 align:start position:0%
um to have better and more viable
resources

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
by having a citing process that's not
 
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
getting the job done we have to get it
 
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
right this bill is not saying that the
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
answer will always be yes it's not
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
saying that the answer will always be no
 
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
it's saying that the path the process to
 
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
get to that answer is clear consistent
 
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
and right for New Hampshire we look
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
forward to being part of the process
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions David will
 
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
probably take uh many of them because
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
he's uh he's better equipped to do so
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative Mick Williams has a
 
00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.089 align:start position:0%
representative Mick Williams has a
question

00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:43:59.089 --> 00:43:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
um you talked about streamlining the
 
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
process can you just explain to me what
 
00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:04.670 align:start position:0%
process can you just explain to me what
a

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
streamlined process timeline looks like
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
is there a certain length that you're
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
shooting for what what is that
 
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
the timelines remain the same in the
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
statute in terms of
 
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
deadlines for completion I think the
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
thought is that the Public Utilities
 
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
Commission is
 
00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:26.339 align:start position:0%
perhaps better able to manage a docket
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
and and get things to progress than the
 
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee might have
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
been able to do in part because there
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
would be fewer members a fewer people
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
sitting on a decision uh they'd only
 
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
have to gather two at the at the least
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
instead of seven
 
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
so follow-up follow-up
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
um so so in terms of the participation
 
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
you only need two people in order to
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
progress and make a decision from any of
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
the checkpoints in the process but I
 
00:44:59.809 --> 00:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
guess my question is are you targeting
 
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
to get through a site evaluation
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
analysis in a certain period of time are
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
you trying to do this in under a year
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
and under six months is is there
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
something that streamlines it compared
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
to historical SEC process no the
 
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.030 align:start position:0%
to historical SEC process no the
timelines

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
timelines
 
00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
the statutory timelines I believe remain
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
the same so the statute does not do that
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
the thought is that the puc would be
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
able to streamline the process because
 
00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
it knows how to to run a docket and to
 
00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay I'm having trouble
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
just understanding that since the puc
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
has had issues representative McWilliams
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
um right
 
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
she asked to follow up do you know
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
what the timeline might look like it is
 
00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
it is it a year
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
clarification question also and yeah
 
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
just to be clear you know we we
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
currently don't oversee the citing
 
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
process so we're you know we'll have the
 
00:46:08.329 --> 00:46:08.339 align:start position:0%
timelines here but um I think David has
 
00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
has that now
 
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
so this is from it's in the current
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
statute it makes its way all the way
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
into the Amendments uh within 365 days
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
of accepting the application the
 
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
commission shall issue or deny the
 
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.710 align:start position:0%
commission shall issue or deny the
certificate

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas thank you Mr
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
thank you I I I believe if for my
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
understanding uh based on representative
 
00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:35.339 align:start position:0%
mcwilliam's question uh the the
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
timelines are the same but if I heard
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
you correctly what you're really saying
 
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
is that this new bill and and
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
potentially the amendment would better
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
ensure that those timelines are met
 
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
versus going over them like certain
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
projects have done before in the past is
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
yeah that's certainly part of it and and
 
00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
streamline might not be the perfect word
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
for what it is there are also you know
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
those administrative efficiencies come
 
00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
in the form of
 
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
you know the funding and the work of the
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
site evaluation process is is kind of
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
what people call Lumpy uh you know there
 
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
are times where it's
 
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
um very busy and there are times where
 
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
it's it's not busy and obviously you
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
know funding that goes along with that
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
under the current process is also lumpy
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
so you know um by incorporating the the
 
00:47:29.089 --> 00:47:29.099 align:start position:0%
parts of the citing process into the
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission into the
 
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
site of into the department of energy
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
um there are opportunities to you know
 
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
leverage other resources at the
 
00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:41.220 align:start position:0%
department at the commission to
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
help smooth out some of that work so
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
that if if there are opportunities where
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
where we need to find uh you know more
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
things to do on on those those uh times
 
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
where there is not a lot of citing work
 
00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
well then now the commission has that
 
00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
resource to do so and likewise when the
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
when the work is
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
is more uh than it normally is
 
00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
um being part of the larger whole gives
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to leverage resources
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
from from the entities that they're a
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
part of
 
00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question I actually want to
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
ask you the same question that
 
00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas asked Mr
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
Beamer uh why is it that the application
 
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
fee for Renewables is so much higher
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
than for other types of energy and I'll
 
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:32.339 align:start position:0%
let David address that I do think that
 
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
that's being preserved from existing
 
00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.270 align:start position:0%
that's being preserved from existing
statute

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
um that that is preserved from existing
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
statute except that in the the most
 
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
recent Amendment there is an additional
 
00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:44.339 align:start position:0%
charge for solar that did not exist
 
00:48:44.339 --> 00:48:45.410 align:start position:0%
charge for solar that did not exist
before

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that those fees
 
00:48:52.809 --> 00:48:52.819 align:start position:0%
were designed to generate the the
 
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
income necessary for the site evaluation
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee to conduct a docket for that
 
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
type of generation so for instance
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
you'll if you'll see that the cost for
 
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
say an oil facility is much less per
 
00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour and that's because you
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't hit some of the same issues
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily as complicated
 
00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:17.300 align:start position:0%
and then secondly
 
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
those facilities tend to be much much
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
larger so you don't have to charge as
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
much per megawatt hour to generate
 
00:49:24.119 --> 00:49:25.430 align:start position:0%
much per megawatt hour to generate
enough

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
funds for the site evaluation committee
 
00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:29.339 align:start position:0%
to conduct its work
 
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense to you yeah
 
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
representative creation has a question
 
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.370 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
um I get so accepting the premise that
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
the SEC has currently constituted is is
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
too inefficient to do its job and we
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
need to bring this function into the
 
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
state government
 
00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.190 align:start position:0%
state government
um

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
I guess why is doe the right home for
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
deciding citing of energy projects like
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
that the doe obviously has
 
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
um a lot of important input into how
 
00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579 align:start position:0%
much energy we need and and things like
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
that but in my
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
mental model
 
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
um citing site evaluation is more about
 
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
the environmental impacts more about the
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
sort of cultural impacts impacts on
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
communities so why why doe instead of
 
00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
Des or another agency sure and I'll just
 
00:50:26.809 --> 00:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
say under this proposal thank you for
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
the question because it's it's important
 
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
to clarify uh under this proposal it
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
would be the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
who would be making those decisions and
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and other
 
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
departments other stakeholders would
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to intervene in
 
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
those dockets and and let our voices be
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
heard for whatever issues are important
 
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.099 align:start position:0%
to us the department of Energy's role
 
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
here would really be on the tail end of
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
things with the ongoing sort of
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
monitoring and compliance with with the
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
certificate that gets put out we are
 
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
pretty well situated to do so we have a
 
00:50:59.930 --> 00:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
division of enforcement we have staff
 
00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:02.579 align:start position:0%
who who do this type of work on things
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
like you know our
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
um our fimza grant which is the pipeline
 
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
safety and hazardous materials uh
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
Administration from the federal
 
00:51:13.809 --> 00:51:13.819 align:start position:0%
government they do the safety work for
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
you know pipelines we have our Dig Safe
 
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
programs we have folks who know the the
 
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
compliance side of things and I think
 
00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
we're well situated to do that work
 
00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
um and likewise the Public Utilities
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
Commission is an adjudicative body that
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
you know professionally looks at energy
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
issues I think they're they are well
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
situated to take in all that input all
 
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
of the you know perspectives and
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
concerns of stakeholders to weigh those
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
things following the criteria that have
 
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
been laid out by this bill and in
 
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
previous pieces of legislation that are
 
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
being carried over and and to render a
 
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
decision so uh I said a lot there I
 
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
don't know David if if I missed anything
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
I think you covered it okay
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
um we heard from the previous testifier
 
00:52:04.849 --> 00:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
from SEC that he felt that Doe had the
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
current staff to absorb this change can
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
you say with confidence that Doe has the
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
current staff to absorb this change
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
sure and and to that sort of earlier
 
00:52:17.329 --> 00:52:17.339 align:start position:0%
question I know there are times where
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
there are pieces of legislation where we
 
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
do raise
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
hey we would need staff to be able to
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
achieve this we would need you know
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
Revenue whatever it is and you know the
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
way our department is is
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
broken up right there are a number of
 
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
Divisions you know four divisions with a
 
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
varied set of responsibilities so I'm
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
talking about this specific yeah yeah
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
and I apologize I'll get there but we
 
00:52:43.609 --> 00:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
can't really just plug and play
 
00:52:43.619 --> 00:52:44.329 align:start position:0%
can't really just plug and play
um

00:52:44.329 --> 00:52:44.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
you know any employee anywhere I think
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
for this task we we do have the
 
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
capabilities and the know-how to get um
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
what we need to do I think the bill does
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
give us the ability to have the revenue
 
00:52:58.970 --> 00:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
to fund those positions so
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sorry did you say think or
 
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
you're confident I I am confident okay I
 
00:53:05.089 --> 00:53:05.099 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:53:09.049 --> 00:53:09.059 align:start position:0%
um have you uh has the doe provided any
 
00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal note information for this
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
specific Bill uh we that is something I
 
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
I know there have been a number of
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
amendments that have come to us so uh I
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if we have sent something in
 
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
it seems like we have not so that's
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
something we can continue to work on yes
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I just want to
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
take another whack at this question and
 
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
and because I haven't heard it really
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
answered adequately yet Perhaps that
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
might be because
 
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
perhaps the question is is best answered
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
by the author of the legislation but
 
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
going back to the application fees can
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
you can you offer a reason as to why
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
the application fee for a solar
 
00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:03.020 align:start position:0%
or a wind energy facility is 10 times
 
00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
that of
 
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
the fee for a natural gas or biomass
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
so those
 
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
those those fees were designed and are
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
in the current legislation with the
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
exception of the additional megawatt fee
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
for solar facilities and it's my
 
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
understanding that those fees were
 
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
designed to generate sufficient income
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
for the SEC to do its work for that type
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
of generation so solar facilities wind
 
00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
facilities tend to be quite small in
 
00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
terms of megawatt hours or megawatts for
 
00:54:47.809 --> 00:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
the facilities and so the megawatt hour
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
charge has to be greater to generate a
 
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
sufficient income whereas larger
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
facilities which are the other types of
 
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
fuels they tend to be larger the the
 
00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour charge can be lower in
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
order to generate the amount of fees
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
necessary for the work to be completed
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
okay so it's it's follow-up follow thank
 
00:55:12.049 --> 00:55:12.059 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so it's a function of
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
the relative scale expected scale of the
 
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
type of facilities that are
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
expected to be seen by the yes that's my
 
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
understanding that goes back quite a
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
number of years but that's that's my
 
00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:26.540 align:start position:0%
memory of it yeah thank you
 
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has another
 
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
question yes uh sorry just a follow-up
 
00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
on that point
 
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
um if it is a function of scale then I'm
 
00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
confused why solar and and wind would
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
then jump to 1800 per megawatt if those
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
larger facilities would be
 
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
easier to
 
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
am I asking this question correctly so
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
if the justification for the higher fee
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
per megawatt is that these facilities
 
00:55:55.849 --> 00:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
are smaller then why would the larger
 
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
facilities end up costing more per
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
megawatt that's confusing to me
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
the larger facilities tend to pay less
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
per megawatt
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
and that generates sufficient income for
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm asking specifically about
 
00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:17.339 align:start position:0%
solar and and win so in the statute it's
 
00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:20.339 align:start position:0%
1200 per megawatt for the first 40 and
 
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
then 1800 per megawatt thereafter okay
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative remember we're not here
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
today we're here to to ask to gather
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
information I think your question was
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
asked institutionally
 
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
so let's move on uh so you know more
 
00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee for you two
 
00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
gentlemen I want to thank you for being
 
00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
here and testifying now I'd like to call
 
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
on the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and assistant
 
00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
00:57:09.049 --> 00:57:09.059 align:start position:0%
Mark Sanborn I'm the assistant
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the New Hampshire
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services I
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
also want to note for the question
 
00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
period the commissioner Scott is also
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
here if there's any interest in
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
questions for the commissioner he's
 
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
happy uh to to address those I know you
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
have over 20 speakers and a number of
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
folks have already spoken so
 
00:57:35.569 --> 00:57:35.579 align:start position:0%
um I when we have a letter of testimony
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
that a letter of support that the
 
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
commissioner signed that I passed around
 
00:57:42.049 --> 00:57:42.059 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get to the heart of the
 
00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
reason Des supports on this legislation
 
00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:50.180 align:start position:0%
the current structure of the SEC
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
and the inefficiencies in the process
 
00:57:56.569 --> 00:57:56.579 align:start position:0%
that result of that structure is the
 
00:57:59.450 --> 00:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
reason Des supports
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
um reforming the process and coming up
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
with a structure that creates
 
00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
predictability not in terms of outcome
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the process and how
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
it'll work
 
00:58:15.049 --> 00:58:15.059 align:start position:0%
and efficiency right now your current
 
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:18.020 align:start position:0%
structure you have a group of volunteers
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
most of whom have no background in
 
00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:24.740 align:start position:0%
either energy or permitting of any kind
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
you have so it is difficult for them to
 
00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
meet never mind come together and make
 
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
good decisions you have a staff of one
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have any budget other than
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
the budget for that position
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
and you have no budget for compliancy or
 
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:50.900 align:start position:0%
following up on decisions
 
00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:53.339 align:start position:0%
there also are some things that this
 
00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
bill corrects that could improve the
 
00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
overall structure and how those of us
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
who are have already having permanent
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities participate in the
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
process which we're also very supportive
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
of in terms of what this legislation
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
does the current SEC does not work
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
it you they can't most of the time they
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
can't get meetings together
 
00:59:17.809 --> 00:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
there's a backlog of complaints
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
um and there is no real movement for all
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
the folks who
 
00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:26.540 align:start position:0%
um continuously support the current SEC
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
there doesn't seem to be any movement to
 
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
then okay let's fund the SEC if you like
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
the current SEC let's give it the staff
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
it needs to
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
um to actually function appropriately
 
00:59:43.609 --> 00:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
as a representative of the department
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
that we're permitting is a major part of
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
what we do I can promise you for all
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
parties involved whether you're
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
supportive of a certain permit or not
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
whether you have concerns whether or not
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
predictability and efficiency in terms
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
of how the process is going to unfold
 
01:00:05.089 --> 01:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
and what to expect in terms of who will
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
be making those decisions and how they
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
will be making those decisions lead to
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
better outcomes
 
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
so at the heart of why Des supports this
 
01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
is we have a role in in energy in the
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
approval of energy infrastructure for
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
the environmental pieces that go along
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
with it we're we're proud of the
 
01:00:29.329 --> 01:00:29.339 align:start position:0%
processes we use for our permitting
 
01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:31.859 align:start position:0%
while always being open to ways we can
 
01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:33.020 align:start position:0%
improve them
 
01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.910 align:start position:0%
improve them
and

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
um we want to be part of a process that
 
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
cites and improves energy infrastructure
 
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
in a way that can be done so all parties
 
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
have a voice and and have acknowledge in
 
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
a process they can trust and and folks
 
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
who are making decisions having the
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
background and expertise that is needed
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
to make those decisions from the
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
perspective of the New Hampshire
 
01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:00.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
that does not exist in the current
 
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
process nor in the current makeup of the
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicum body nor in the total lack of
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
budget or staff to do the follow-up work
 
01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
for compliancy one other thing I'll note
 
01:01:20.289 --> 01:01:20.299 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stick I'm going to
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
stay tight to the and my responses to
 
01:01:27.609 --> 01:01:27.619 align:start position:0%
those areas that we can answer as as Des
 
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the free structure Etc I
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
won't be able to give you an answer
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
other than the current fees are based on
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
the existing
 
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
um uh the committee will have to work
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
with the folks who formed those fee
 
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
structures if they really want to know
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
what went behind creating those fees
 
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to answer any
 
01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:52.609 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to answer any
questions

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving us the Department's
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
perspective on this legislation
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative McWilliams has
 
01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to understand how this
 
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
works in terms of the concerns about the
 
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:08.339 align:start position:0%
public the member of the public or
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
participation by the public and concerns
 
01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:12.059 align:start position:0%
that that would hold up because the
 
01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
member of the public cannot attend a
 
01:02:13.619 --> 01:02:14.990 align:start position:0%
member of the public cannot attend a
meeting

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:15.890 align:start position:0%
meeting
um

01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
but would you would you be open to some
 
01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
kind of a you know 10 members of the
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
public who could who could cycle through
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
or all attend but only have one voice so
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
the uh with respect to representative
 
01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:32.579 align:start position:0%
your mischaracterizing I think the
 
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
members of the state agencies don't show
 
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:35.870 align:start position:0%
members of the state agencies don't show
up

01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
so it's not the members of the public
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
not showing up it's that this is a group
 
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
of folks who this isn't their core job
 
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
all these folks have other
 
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and therefore I I don't
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
mean I love Taylor Caswell so I mean
 
01:02:54.049 --> 01:02:54.059 align:start position:0%
this very respectfully ba never shows up
 
01:02:56.569 --> 01:02:56.579 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the public makeup
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
it has to it has to do with the entire
 
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
makeup that includes the state agencies
 
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.170 align:start position:0%
makeup that includes the state agencies
involved

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
there in every process in every one of
 
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:08.339 align:start position:0%
our process there's ample opportunity
 
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
for other public input or other state
 
01:03:14.569 --> 01:03:14.579 align:start position:0%
agencies to have their voice be heard
 
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
about a permitting decision that is
 
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
being made I am extremely confident that
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
by making these structural changes the
 
01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
ability of departments and the public to
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
have their voice heard be be Heard On
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
Any Given item in front of the puc will
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
still exist if anything
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
um it it'll exist in a little bit
 
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
different than it happens in the other
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
permitting but DS doesn't hold hearings
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
for every permit if there is opportunity
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
in every in every case for there to be
 
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
public input so I am very confident
 
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
there will still be public input and you
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
will just have a body of folks who this
 
01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
is part of their primary responsibility
 
01:04:04.849 --> 01:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
and therefore will be able to more
 
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
efficiently and predictably meet
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
um to be in order for this and and just
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
one additional thing to your earlier
 
01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
question the streamlining isn't in
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
changing the process per se the
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
streamlining of this bill is reforming
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
the structure so that it can it has the
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
membership and staff who are dedicated
 
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
to these activities evolving site the
 
01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:36.380 align:start position:0%
sighting of energy infrastructure
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up question follow-up so just to
 
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about three puc
 
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as the site evaluation
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
committee that's it and only two
 
01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
actually need to attend in order to move
 
01:04:50.809 --> 01:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
forward on any decision that's the
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
proposal so I'm asking if we can change
 
01:04:56.329 --> 01:04:56.339 align:start position:0%
that makeup and add a couple more to get
 
01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
a little bit of variety here because the
 
01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:00.299 align:start position:0%
puc is all appointees and it doesn't all
 
01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily reflect the
 
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
interests of everyone in this room
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at uh the proposal for
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
having the Attorney General appoint
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
somebody to be a member or be involved
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
perhaps that person could have a voting
 
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
Authority so that there's at least
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
something beyond the puc right I hear
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
what you're saying about attendance and
 
01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
perhaps different departments don't have
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
the same interest and it's not a
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
priority or they don't feel that they
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
get enough money to compensate people to
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
attend these all of those are legitimate
 
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
concerns but fundamentally we want to
 
01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
have a site evaluation committee that is
 
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
neutral that is independent and so the
 
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
concern is making sure that we have the
 
01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
bodies there that are voting who
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
represent those interests to be neutral
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
and independent and I'm not convinced
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
that three puc Commissioners are truly
 
01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:46.619 align:start position:0%
neutral and independent because there
 
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
are pointees so what I'm looking at is
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
would you be open to an amendment or
 
01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
changes to you know get more members on
 
01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
that board we're going from seven to
 
01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.630 align:start position:0%
that board we're going from seven to
three

01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
um respectfully no I I that's the whole
 
01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.589 align:start position:0%
um respectfully no I I that's the whole
problem

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
um more voices are only beneficial if
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
more voices improve the process in this
 
01:06:06.359 --> 01:06:07.789 align:start position:0%
more voices improve the process in this
case

01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:06:07.799 --> 01:06:09.670 align:start position:0%
case
um

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
the key to a good permitting
 
01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
and or approving a Distributive process
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
is ensuring all voices have the
 
01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to the
 
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
um to the item to the issue to the
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
project in question not if that not that
 
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
a board or an individual whoever is
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
approving it are made up of all those
 
01:06:34.799 --> 01:06:36.410 align:start position:0%
approving it are made up of all those
voices

01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
voices
 
01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:39.190 align:start position:0%
voices
um

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
I would it's to me it's not important
 
01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
the number of folks who make up the
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
adjudicive body it's do the folks on
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
that board have the expertise in terms
 
01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
of energy and permitting to
 
01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
okay representative Carmen has a
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
assuming that these these uh facilities
 
01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
have environmental impacts
 
01:07:14.089 --> 01:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
why is des willing to actually cut
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
itself out of the decision procedure and
 
01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
we're not but but that's not this it's
 
01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
only the puc that means this bill
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that if there's a Wetlands
 
01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:25.619 align:start position:0%
permit required for a project to move
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
forward there will still be a Wetlands
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
fraud a permit obtained if there is an
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain permit required
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
for a project the project will still
 
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
um obtain an aot permit they will be
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
attached to the certificate so the
 
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:45.500 align:start position:0%
permit will go through our process and
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
once approved it'll be attached to the
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
certificate thereby noting that the
 
01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
environmental approvals needed
 
01:07:57.049 --> 01:07:57.059 align:start position:0%
improvements needed to obtain a project
 
01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
have gone forward so so we are not
 
01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:03.299 align:start position:0%
cutting ourselves out of the process we
 
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
um all of our required a jurisdiction
 
01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
elections will still happen and the only
 
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
difference between this and other
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects that will be
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
attached to a certificate that gets
 
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:18.299 align:start position:0%
approved by the puc
 
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
well I'm up
 
01:08:23.209 --> 01:08:23.219 align:start position:0%
understood would these permits then
 
01:08:23.219 --> 01:08:24.590 align:start position:0%
understood would these permits then
happen

01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
um concurrently with the site evaluation
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
process by the puc or afterward so the
 
01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
will these slow down the process
 
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
our our process I mean it won't slow
 
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
down any more than the normal process
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
required for achieving a Wetlands permit
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
or an aot permit or whatever required
 
01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
for the facility
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
um uh what the
 
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.189 align:start position:0%
um uh what the
um

01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
so is when the whoever is working on the
 
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
development project or the
 
01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
infrastructure project they will be
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
informed of the
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
um permits they need to in order for
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
them to move forward with their project
 
01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.870 align:start position:0%
them to move forward with their project
so

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
um it is on the developer to obtain the
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
environmental approvals they need and
 
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
like I said in other cases if there's a
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
a jurisdictional we have something Army
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
Corps has something fish and game has
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
something we all just do our work and
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
the um the developer or the person
 
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
pursuing the permits house to you know
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
obtains all of them separately the only
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
difference here is that to um show that
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
those have been obtained once they've
 
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
gone through our process they get
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
attached to the certificate just to
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
verify that this project has achieved
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
the environmental permits it needs
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%

the Deputy Commissioner if I think it
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
would be in follow-up to my colleague's
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
question if it'd be helpful to refer to
 
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
it's uh section 363 D7 application for

contemporaneously filed with the state

agency having jurisdictions exactly yes
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
sir and and and the only thing I'll add
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
is uh well I know it hasn't been
 
01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:03.260 align:start position:0%
introduced and you guys will debate it
 
01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
as I noted in the letter from as the the
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner noted in his letter
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
um we did offer technical assistance to
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative bows in terms of some of
 
01:11:15.649 --> 01:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
the changes and I know they're reflected
 
01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
in the Chairman's Amendment he'll be
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
bringing forward to clarify some of
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
these uh including the appeal process
 
01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
portion of this
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
all right I'll allow one more question
 
01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
and then we have a move move on we have
 
01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
a lot of public voices that want to be
 
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
heard here this morning so
 
01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas you get the
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
last question yay thank you Mr chair
 
01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:40.739 align:start position:0%
um I am as has been sort of uh referred
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
to in the last few questions I'm
 
01:11:43.729 --> 01:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
concerned about the loss of
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
environmental impact evaluation I'm kind
 
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
of a you know save the world save the
 
01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
whales kind of gal here
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
um I understand you're going to be
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
involved in permits I have concerns that
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
that testing May um may be dropped
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
um in in particular I'm looking at lines
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
13 and 14 on page four that says all
 
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts or effects are
 
01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
adequately regulated by other federal
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
state or local statutes rules or
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances Des is not specifically
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
called out can you show me in the bill
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
where Des is mandated to be part of this
 
01:12:18.239 --> 01:12:20.030 align:start position:0%
where Des is mandated to be part of this
process

01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
um all of the existing state statutes
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
that exist that require folks that if
 
01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
they impact a Wetlands they have to get
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
a Wetlands permit if they're going to do
 
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain they have to
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
obtain an alteration alteration of
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
terrain permit the uh those statutes
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
aren't in question here today and
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
um and the references to the bill refer
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
to those existing statutes as still
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
being the law of the land and I'm still
 
01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
we will still continue to follow our
 
01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:54.380 align:start position:0%
statutes and regulations as they exist
 
01:12:56.890 --> 01:12:56.900 align:start position:0%
and will
 
01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:00.500 align:start position:0%
inform this process of when our
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
requirements have been met
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
um and does that include um for example
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
testing of soil for uh environmental
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
contaminations and or air whatever is
 
01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
required to meet one of our permits now
 
01:13:16.729 --> 01:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
um still required to meet a permit um
 
01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
whether it's going through this process
 
01:13:24.649 --> 01:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
or not so the all
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
um I can assure you New Hampshire New
 
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
Services would not be supporting this
 
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
bill if we thought in any way shape or
 
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
form it reduced our ability to fulfill
 
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
our responsibilities under federal and
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
state statute to protect the environment
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
and natural resources of this state and
 
01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
what we have jurisdiction over I would
 
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
argue and why we support the bill and
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
improved process in terms of deciding
 
01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
will improve our ability to make sure on
 
01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
the environmental requirements are met
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
in a better coordinated better
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
structured and more efficient process so
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
we are here supporting this bill because
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
we think it'll lead to better outcomes
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
across the board including the
 
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
environmental thank you thank you
 
01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner we really appreciate you
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
being here to testify on this bill and
 
01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
giving us the Department's perspective
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the opportunity thank you
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and members and now I'd like to
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
get the utility perspective on this
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
question by calling on Michael Licata
 
01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr locata
 
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
for the record Michael Licata
 
01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
representing eversource energy I
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
understand you have numerous pink cards
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
and much of what I would testify to has
 
01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
already been covered by previous
 
01:14:57.169 --> 01:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
speakers uh eversource does support uh
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 609 as introduced I do
 
01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
understand there's an amendment that I
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
grabbed this morning I have not had an
 
01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see that or review it so
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
we reserve judgment on changes proposed
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
in the amendment but as introduced the
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
company does support
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
our view uh just to briefly Echo uh what
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
others had said is that all stakeholders
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
whether they're the public a
 
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
municipality a regulator or a developer
 
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
should want a clear process that is
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
understood by all and uh consistently
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
applies the law as you've heard the
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
current SEC process
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
has its shortcomings in these areas that
 
01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:47.420 align:start position:0%
is due to a number of structural changes
 
01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
with unintended consequences that were
 
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
adopted by the legislature several years
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
ago with the best of intentions to
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
provide agencies with additional
 
01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:00.500 align:start position:0%
flexibility to address some of the
 
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
workload and scheduling concerns that
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
you have heard
 
01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
we believe that uh putting the depart
 
01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission in
 
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
charge of uh application reviews uh is
 
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
is a logical Choice as you have heard
 
01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
that is a body that has expertise
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
knowledge and resources to handle large
 
01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
and complicated adjudicative proceedings
 
01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
as they do today we too share concerns
 
01:16:31.490 --> 01:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
about resources uh with the the
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
department and certainly uh support
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
efforts to uh address that so that all
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
parties can have uh consistency of
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
timelines and the required staff support
 
01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
we also believe that further
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
strengthening the
 
01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:49.729 align:start position:0%
strengthening the
um

01:16:49.729 --> 01:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:52.729 --> 01:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
post application enforcement process by
 
01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
putting the Department of Environmental
 
01:16:58.729 --> 01:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
excuse me Department of energy in charge
 
01:17:02.689 --> 01:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
the SEC administrator under the the doe
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
is logical as well and will provide
 
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
efficiencies for for those members of
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
the public or municipality that have
 
01:17:14.209 --> 01:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
concerns post-construction that a
 
01:17:17.689 --> 01:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
project is conforming to the terms of
 
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
their permit application
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have
 
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate the utility
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
perspective on
 
01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions from the committee
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for your testimony and I
 
01:17:38.209 --> 01:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
will point out that the
 
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
Amendment does
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
place the cited administrators the site
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
evaluation process administrator under
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
the commission not on the department of
 
01:17:48.239 --> 01:17:49.790 align:start position:0%
the commission not on the department of
energy

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll now try to get some
 
01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
perspective from the business and
 
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
industry sector by calling on Mike
 
01:17:59.450 --> 01:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
Skelton from the business and industry
 
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for the
 
01:18:20.290 --> 01:18:20.300 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here today
 
01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
my name is Mike Skelton I'm the
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
president CEO of the business industry
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire we're a New
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Statewide Chamber of Commerce
 
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
State manufacturing association and
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
leading business advocate we represent
 
01:18:35.209 --> 01:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
more than 400 businesses across the
 
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that collectively
 
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
employ more than a hundred thousand
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
individuals and contribute nearly five
 
01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
billion dollars to our state's economy
 
01:18:44.699 --> 01:18:45.470 align:start position:0%
billion dollars to our state's economy
um

01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
I know you have a lot of testimony to
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
get to I'm passing around a copy of our
 
01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
formal testimony for your review so
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
rather than read that I'll just offer a
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
few General comments
 
01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
um and then I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:19:03.169 --> 01:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
questions if I can be helpful
 
01:19:03.179 --> 01:19:04.370 align:start position:0%
questions if I can be helpful
um

01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure is an issue and a priority
 
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
for you the cost of energy is a high
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
public policy priority for our
 
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
organization and has been for many years
 
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
um one of the challenges that I also
 
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
know that you're aware of is that being
 
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
part of a regional energy Market
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have as many tools necessarily
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
or levers that we can pull to solve that
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
issue for our state alone
 
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
in our view though
 
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
citing and improving our citing process
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
is one of if not the most important
 
01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
levers that we do control here in our
 
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
state that we should look to as a way to
 
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
lower the cost of energy sustainably in
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
the future
 
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
we're here in support of House Bill 609
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
we consider it one of our higher
 
01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:54.380 align:start position:0%
priority legislative issues this session
 
01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
as others have already testified we
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
think this bill and the efforts it puts
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
forth will result in a more stable clear
 
01:20:06.169 --> 01:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
consistent citing process that will
 
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
support the development of projects we
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
need to lower our energy costs
 
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
and those projects will run the gamut of
 
01:20:15.130 --> 01:20:15.140 align:start position:0%
all different types of Technology
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
however I will say and I I think this is
 
01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
informed by conversations I have with
 
01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:22.250 align:start position:0%
informed by conversations I have with
developers

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
developers
 
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
um energy experts folks who closely work
 
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
in this area that in all likelihood the
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
energy we're going to be developing
 
01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
going forward is going to be renewable
 
01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:33.500 align:start position:0%
energy sources and I think in our view
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
renewable energy sources need this
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
improved process it will benefit them
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
and it will ensure that we can develop
 
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
these resources and strengthen our our
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
pool of resources for the future
 
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
have others have noted our current
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
process has some flaws and some issues
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
and in our view it doesn't serve the
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
best interests of our state at this time
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
particularly when we are faced with an
 
01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
energy crisis and the need to lower
 
01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:02.950 align:start position:0%
energy crisis and the need to lower
costs

01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:21:05.689 --> 01:21:05.699 align:start position:0%
as has already been stated again I think
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
we would point to similar flaws with the
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
part-time nature of the SEC has really
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
outlived its its lifespan its useful
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
lifespan in our state and the resulting
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
process is not stable or clear or
 
01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
consistent for the critical decision
 
01:21:23.930 --> 01:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
making we need when we're looking at
 
01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
building new energy infrastructures and
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
the study committees that have been held
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
in 2021 and 2022 by and large in
 
01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
reviewing the reports and having staff
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
who participated in those sessions reach
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
those same conclusions and we thank the
 
01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
committee for their their work in those
 
01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:42.709 align:start position:0%
committee for their their work in those
areas

01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
if there's one takeaway from those study
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
committees that I think is important
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
from a overall perspective is that the
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
status quo simply isn't working
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
those study committees we couldn't we
 
01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
wouldn't keep going back to the well
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
with the work of those study committees
 
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
in this issue being coming up year after
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
year if there wasn't a problem here that
 
01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed
 
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
so I think that's one imperative that I
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
would leave you with here today is that
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
this is a real issue it's going to be
 
01:22:15.169 --> 01:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
important for the future of our state
 
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
looking out over the next 10 20 30 40
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
years and we need a process that is more
 
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
I just want to note here for the record
 
01:22:30.169 --> 01:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
and this has been touched on by others
 
01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
from our view what this bill does and
 
01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't do
 
01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
we do believe the bill makes the process
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
more efficient and more effective
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
but in our reading in our close review
 
01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
of this it does not lessen the standards
 
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
required of a project
 
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
and it does not lessen the opportunities
 
01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
for public participation
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
nor does it diminish the requirements
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
expected of developers attached to my
 
01:22:59.570 --> 01:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
formal testimony is a side by side of
 
01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
the RSA specifically focused on the
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
public participation that has been
 
01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
raised as others have mentioned as a
 
01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:08.699 align:start position:0%
concern here and I just want to share
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
our view on this
 
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
you know there are significant
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities ahead to transform our
 
01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
energy sector there's a lot of exciting
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
changes happening new technology coming
 
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
online or technology becoming more
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
affordable at the federal level as
 
01:23:27.890 --> 01:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
you're all aware there's been
 
01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
significant legislation that has created
 
01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
new incentive tens of billions of
 
01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
dollars of incentives in the inflation
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
reduction act and States across our
 
01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
country are going to be competing and
 
01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
working to attract those incentives and
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
attract the development that comes with
 
01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
those incentives to their state
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
and I have a concern we are concerned
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire will not be best
 
01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
positioned to take advantage of those
 
01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities unless we strengthen our
 
01:23:58.970 --> 01:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
citing process and I would note in
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
addition that this is not just a state
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
issue that there has been bipartisan
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
interest and discussion ongoing for the
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
better part of a year about Federal
 
01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
permitting and citing reform because
 
01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
there is a recognition at that level as
 
01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
well that if we're going to take
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
advantage of these incentives and
 
01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
develop more renewable energy we need to
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
fix Federal citing and permitting reform
 
01:24:23.209 --> 01:24:23.219 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:24:26.930 --> 01:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to close with one uh to
 
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
cite someone else who I believe I don't
 
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
think Dawn crease is in the room today I
 
01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
don't think he could be here but I was
 
01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:34.940 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:24:38.689 --> 01:24:38.699 align:start position:0%
see his letter that he submitted today
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh don is a very eloquent speaker
 
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
I think he put it really succinctly in
 
01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
his letter and I just wanted to read
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
that for the record when he was speaking
 
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
on why the puc is the right fit in terms
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
of being the solution for moving the SEC
 
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
Authority in this in his letter he says
 
01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
the process of deciding what should be
 
01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
built becomes the province of a body
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
that is singularly focused on the energy
 
01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
needs of the state as a whole
 
01:25:14.450 --> 01:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
it also requires a tribunal with the
 
01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
capacity to conduct complex contested
 
01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
administrative proceedings effectively
 
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
efficiently and fairly
 
01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
I just think that really encapsulates
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
what this bill is all about the problem
 
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
we're trying to solve and how important
 
01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
it is that we get this right thank you
 
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
for your time this morning I'd be happy
 
01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you we
 
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony here this
 
01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:39.229 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony here this
morning

01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
you made mention and I will expand it on
 
01:25:54.169 --> 01:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
you know as we grow our renewable energy
 
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
projects specifically either offshore
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
wind or major solar projects that will
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
require additional transmission lines to
 
01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
get you know usable energy to everybody
 
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
will this bill and its uh amendment
 
01:26:12.490 --> 01:26:12.500 align:start position:0%
should be adopted make it a lot easier
 
01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
for those transmission lines for our
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects to be built so
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
that we can enjoy the benefits of the
 
01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
renewable energies thank you for the
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
question I don't think I wouldn't say
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
this makes uh the development of those
 
01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
transmission lines easier that's not the
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
word I would use I would say I think
 
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
this bill creates a process by which
 
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
that type of infrastructure will be able
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
to be fairly and effectively assessed
 
01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
and uh equitably decided upon but your
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
question is an extremely important one
 
01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:50.770 align:start position:0%
question is an extremely important one
because

01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:50.780 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt that the singular
 
01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
challenge we are going to face with
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
bringing on board more renewable energy
 
01:26:59.330 --> 01:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
resources is going to be the
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
transmission that connects them to the
 
01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
hubs of demand
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
and and this is I I could uh send the
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
committee hundreds of articles
 
01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
from across the country on this exact
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
issue and how States and our federal
 
01:27:19.129 --> 01:27:19.139 align:start position:0%
government are well aware that we are
 
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
facing a massive challenge with building
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
the transmission needed to connect new
 
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
resources that we build with where it
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
needs to go and be consumed and state
 
01:27:31.129 --> 01:27:31.139 align:start position:0%
citing and federal citing is going to be
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
a huge part of making sure that we're
 
01:27:34.729 --> 01:27:34.739 align:start position:0%
able to take advantage of those new
 
01:27:34.739 --> 01:27:37.129 align:start position:0%
able to take advantage of those new
opportunities

01:27:37.129 --> 01:27:37.139 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question you know in New
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I get feedback from people
 
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
from not only just in New Hampshire but
 
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
all of New England we sort of have a
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
very bad negative reputation um if you
 
01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
look at Northern Pass whether you're in
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
favor of against it millions and
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars was spent and
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
nothing was accomplished literally uh
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
the Antrim win project took I think five
 
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
or six years to get permitted two full
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
applications and it's less than 30
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
megawatts so with this build you think
 
01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
kind of send a message that we're at
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
least being a little bit more open to
 
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
new energy projects in New Hampshire and
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's not just not going with the uh you
 
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
know not my backyard syndrome uh don't
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
build anything here anywhere as long as
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's in New Hampshire will this help in
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
our view absolutely thank you for the
 
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
question I I think we need to
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that New Hampshire is open
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
for business and we have a stable
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
consistent process that is going to
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
treat projects fairly and it's not about
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
making the process easier for projects I
 
01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize that there's nothing
 
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
here that diminishes the standards that
 
01:28:47.090 --> 01:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
they have to overcome but to a question
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
that was raised earlier around timing
 
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there has been
 
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
several projects where the existing
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
process has not result in a decision in
 
01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
the required amount of time I think
 
01:28:58.970 --> 01:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
that's the key
 
01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
if the current statute says you have to
 
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
issue a certificate within 365 days and
 
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
we're not doing that that's not a stable
 
01:29:08.090 --> 01:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
consistent process
 
01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
and whether and I I would bet and this
 
01:29:12.110 --> 01:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
goes for developers of anything whether
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
it's housing whether it's public
 
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure whether it's anything
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
that you need to they want to know
 
01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
what's the process what's the timeline
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
is it consistent and so if you have a
 
01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
project in your your record this the
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
process says we'll get you a decision in
 
01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
365 days they want to know up or down
 
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
within that 365 days
 
01:29:36.169 --> 01:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
in my view a success would be whether or
 
01:29:38.810 --> 01:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
not the SEC is approving or denying
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
projects if it can do that quicker
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a better process
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
because that's going to give more
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
consistency and understanding and
 
01:29:49.970 --> 01:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
stability to the process process that
 
01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
developers have to evaluate when they're
 
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
considering making Investments here in
 
01:29:56.570 --> 01:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.610 --> 01:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and this is
 
01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
actually not a question just I have to
 
01:30:03.649 --> 01:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
make a statement for the record that my
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
other company I founded is a member of
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
Bia and I'm personally a member of their
 
01:30:10.729 --> 01:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
technology committee
 
01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting us know that
 
01:30:15.709 --> 01:30:15.719 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a question
 
01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:18.290 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
um this is sort of a follow-up to
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas's question so you
 
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:23.219 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you think most projects
 
01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
going forward will be Renewables which
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
is um obviously something I'm happy to
 
01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
hear uh do you think given that it would
 
01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to take this opportunity
 
01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
to change the pricing structure of the
 
01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
permit application so renewable projects
 
01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
aren't charged 10 times per kilowatt or
 
01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
at least aren't penalized for being
 
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
larger than 40 megawatts yeah um there's
 
01:30:43.970 --> 01:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
been a lot of questions about that today
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage uh there may be
 
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
others who could come and speak to the
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee to explain the historic
 
01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind that fee structure but
 
01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
I want to I guess say as a matter of
 
01:30:59.689 --> 01:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
um you know our view on this the fee
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
structure is a policy issue
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature can set whatever fee
 
01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
structure you like and that will create
 
01:31:07.729 --> 01:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
incentives or disincentives for
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
different projects
 
01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
my understanding however is the
 
01:31:13.490 --> 01:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
historical reasoning behind the fee
 
01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:16.139 align:start position:0%
structure which I believe is not changed
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
in the proposal either the as introduced
 
01:31:21.850 --> 01:31:21.860 align:start position:0%
or the amendment is that it was around
 
01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
generating the right amount of income to
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
support what a project would cost moving
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
through the SEC process and that was the
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
only reason behind the fee structure is
 
01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
I understand it so I don't believe there
 
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
was any intent to
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
punish or disincentivize or incentivize
 
01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
certain types of development there was a
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
methodology behind it and I think there
 
01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:45.540 align:start position:0%
could perhaps be others who are involved
 
01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
in the history of the SEC who could
 
01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
speak to that better than I
 
01:31:51.290 --> 01:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair in your side
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
by side comparison
 
01:31:59.090 --> 01:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
it looks like the current law and I'm
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
looking at on page two of that printout
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
sections um four and five under current
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
laws seem to be missing under 609 so I
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
just want to confirm that the Bia is
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable with eliminating some
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
hearings investigations or studies
 
01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
reasonable studies and investigations
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
those two sections yeah thank you
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
representative in totality in looking at
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
the comparison we thought that this does
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
not diminish the public participation
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities so I realize the structure
 
01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
is different you know the paragraphs in
 
01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
some cases have been streamlined or
 
01:32:36.530 --> 01:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
shortened I think that's a matter of
 
01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
policy on your part to determine does
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
the statute list the intended number of
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities and hearings but in
 
01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
totality we view the process and how
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
this is proposed in House Bill 609 as
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
being ample comparable and does not
 
01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
diminish the opportunity for public
 
01:32:58.490 --> 01:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
input follow-up follow-up thank you and
 
01:33:00.649 --> 01:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
with this shortened schedule might there
 
01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
be an unintended consequences for
 
01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:05.090 align:start position:0%
be an unintended consequences for
businesses

01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you explain a little
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
further what you mean by unintended
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
consequences well we
 
01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:11.510 align:start position:0%
consequences well we
are

01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:13.970 align:start position:0%
are
um

01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:15.770 --> 01:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
playing to after the project's already
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
been started or after it's been
 
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
completed so would there in your opinion
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
would this shortened schedule could it
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
lead to unintended consequences like
 
01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:25.310 align:start position:0%
lead to unintended consequences like
that

01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
well just to clarify thank you for the
 
01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
question I'm not sure uh I would I would
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
phrase as a shortened schedule I think
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
what we view is this process will
 
01:33:37.729 --> 01:33:37.739 align:start position:0%
streamline the ability for a project to
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
be completed on time through the process
 
01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
through the the intended initial goal
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
time of within 365 days now whether a
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
project moves through that 365-day
 
01:33:54.530 --> 01:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
window in one month six months or the
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
full 12 months is entirely dependent
 
01:33:58.970 --> 01:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
upon the quality of their application
 
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
and what they put forth what the nature
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
of it is and how that is then
 
01:34:06.290 --> 01:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
adjudicated through the process I think
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
in our view we we the advantage we see
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
to this is that under the puc which is
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
an existing adjudicative body they will
 
01:34:18.050 --> 01:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
better be able to effectively move
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
projects through that process and
 
01:34:22.729 --> 01:34:22.739 align:start position:0%
uncover any issues that need to be
 
01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
resolved in a more timely fashion than
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
in the current uh process you know it
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
was I'll Echo what others have said
 
01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
before me that when you have our
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
existing process that struggles to
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
bring together quorums and you have
 
01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
membership that well well-intentioned
 
01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
are not experts in the processes that
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
they are reviewing I think that leads to
 
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
delay and potentially can lead to
 
01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
oversights and unintended consequences
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to see
 
01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you very much we
 
01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here to give us the
 
01:34:59.810 --> 01:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
perspective of the business uh community
 
01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:03.179 align:start position:0%
before we turn to a perspective from the
 
01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
consumer community
 
01:35:08.450 --> 01:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
I will alert you to the fact that it is
 
01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
now 10 35 or so 10 33 actually and we
 
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
were scheduled to open a public hearing
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 142 at 10 30.
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
obviously we're not going to make that
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
time period
 
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
I will also point out that we have a
 
01:35:30.649 --> 01:35:30.659 align:start position:0%
hard stop of one o'clock this afternoon
 
01:35:32.689 --> 01:35:32.699 align:start position:0%
because several members of our committee
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
are committed to other activities
 
01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
beginning at one o'clock
 
01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
continue this public hearing and we'll
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
start the public hearing on House Bill
 
01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:48.189 align:start position:0%
start the public hearing on House Bill
142.

01:35:48.189 --> 01:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
142.
 
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
insufficient time to finish it by one
 
01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:52.370 align:start position:0%
insufficient time to finish it by one
o'clock

01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
so let's try to get this one done by 11
 
01:35:58.129 --> 01:35:58.139 align:start position:0%
or 11 30 at the latest so that we'll
 
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
have time to do 142 before 1 o'clock
 
01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
complete 142 before one o'clock with
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
that said I'll Now call on Mark Brown of
 
01:36:10.729 --> 01:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
the consumer energy Alliance to give us
 
01:36:12.649 --> 01:36:12.659 align:start position:0%
the consumer's perspective on this
 
01:36:12.659 --> 01:36:17.229 align:start position:0%
the consumer's perspective on this
legislation

01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:20.270 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
committee

01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Mark Brown
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
vice president of state affairs for
 
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
Consumer Energy Alliance ceas a
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
nationwide Association made up of both
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
energy producers and consumers looking
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
to advance all of the above energy
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
policies that deliver affordable and
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
reliable energy
 
01:36:37.870 --> 01:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
and environmentally responsible energy
 
01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
to families and businesses I'm here
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
today in support of the bill
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to repeat I think Mr
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
Skelton pretty much said a lot of the
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
things that I wanted to say I think this
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
bill balance is competing interests
 
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I will answer one question that
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas answered earlier
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
about investment a few years ago at a
 
01:36:58.490 --> 01:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire business and industry
 
01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
Association Symposium
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
represented from Barclays was speaking
 
01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
and said that you know the current
 
01:37:07.129 --> 01:37:07.139 align:start position:0%
citing laws in New Hampshire were
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
basically sending us to an invest a
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
signal to investors that New Hampshire
 
01:37:13.850 --> 01:37:13.860 align:start position:0%
was not open for for investment for
 
01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:15.050 align:start position:0%
was not open for for investment for
infrastructure

01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to you know kind of
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
affirm what he said
 
01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:22.070 align:start position:0%
affirm what he said
um

01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
we know Regional you know high energy
 
01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:26.060 align:start position:0%
costs I won't I won't repeat that but
 
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
electricity demand is expected to
 
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
increase over the next 10 years or so by
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 20 according to ISO a
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
lot of that's due to increase Demand on
 
01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
the electricity and then excuse me the
 
01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
transportation and heating sectors from
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
electrification so we are going to need
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
energy infrastructure to suit our
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
growing electricity demand
 
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
and I think Mr Skelton is right when he
 
01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
says that most of those resources are
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
going to come from Renewables I don't
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
see any new additional natural gas you
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
know Greenfield natural gas pipelines
 
01:37:59.930 --> 01:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
being into the region to develop natural
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
gas plants or anything like that so I
 
01:38:04.330 --> 01:38:04.340 align:start position:0%
think any fear that this bill is
 
01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
anti-renewable is a little bit of
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
unfounded maybe
 
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.129 align:start position:0%
unfounded maybe
um

01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:10.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
and the again the process the public
 
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
process hasn't changed and I also want
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
to follow up something Mr Beamer said
 
01:38:21.050 --> 01:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
about resiliency it's important that the
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
bill is this bill is not
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
structured in a way that seems to be
 
01:38:28.370 --> 01:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
partisan it's not kind of trying to rig
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
to suit the current Administration or
 
01:38:33.169 --> 01:38:33.179 align:start position:0%
the current puc or you know whatever
 
01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
current uh Authority and state agencies
 
01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
or what party is in charge so I think
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's important and it's this is not a
 
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
stark departure from what a lot of other
 
01:38:44.689 --> 01:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
states do a lot of other states have you
 
01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:46.139 align:start position:0%
know their Public Utilities commissions
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
or public service commissions kind of in
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
charge of citing either directly or or
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
are accompanied by some other agency so
 
01:38:55.330 --> 01:38:55.340 align:start position:0%
this is not a stark departure from that
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
as far as you know electric transmission
 
01:38:59.870 --> 01:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
goes and the need to you know deliver
 
01:39:02.570 --> 01:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
Renewables there's an interesting you
 
01:39:04.010 --> 01:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
know a little headline in Bloomberg
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
green yesterday that said uh there's no
 
01:39:09.050 --> 01:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
transition without transmission so I
 
01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
think if you want to see renewable
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
energy developed we're going to need to
 
01:39:14.090 --> 01:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
meet that demand you know we're going to
 
01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
need to lower cost you know 60 percent
 
01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
of the Americans right now
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
living paycheck to paycheck they don't
 
01:39:21.649 --> 01:39:21.659 align:start position:0%
have five hundred dollars in savings
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
they can't afford a thousand dollar
 
01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
emergency so the developer of you know
 
01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is going to be important
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to take up too much more
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
time I know a lot of people are here to
 
01:39:31.490 --> 01:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
speak so with that I'll take any
 
01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:32.810 align:start position:0%
speak so with that I'll take any
questions

01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:39:34.729 --> 01:39:34.739 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate your testimony
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
giving us the consumer perspective
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions from the committee
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
I'll uh thank you and move along and
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
call on David public cover
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the Appalachian Mountain Club to give
 
01:40:22.330 --> 01:40:22.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
all right so are we on
 
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh chairman Vose
 
01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman Thomas members of the
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
committee my name is David publikover
 
01:40:34.129 --> 01:40:34.139 align:start position:0%
I'm senior staff scientist and assistant
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
director of research for the Appalachian
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
Mountain club based in Gorham New
 
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm testifying on behalf of
 
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
the AMC in opposition to hb609
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh the AMC has a long history of
 
01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
involvement in issues of energy facility
 
01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
sighting in the state we have been
 
01:40:51.770 --> 01:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
interveners in the permitting of several
 
01:40:54.169 --> 01:40:54.179 align:start position:0%
projects before the SEC and we're
 
01:40:56.810 --> 01:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
actively involved engaged in the
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
extensive legislative and Regulatory
 
01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:02.699 align:start position:0%
process the sb99 process that updated
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
the sec's structure and rules less than
 
01:41:06.530 --> 01:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
a decade ago
 
01:41:08.330 --> 01:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
if the legislature is going to dismiss
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
the efforts of the many people who
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
participated in that effort and
 
01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
eliminate the SEC there should be a
 
01:41:14.590 --> 01:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
strong reason
 
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
we know of No Such reason
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
we support the development of new clean
 
01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
energy infrastructure in the state both
 
01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
generation and transmission to address
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
the critical impacts of fossil fuel
 
01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:29.219 align:start position:0%
burning on our climate we also recognize
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
that the current permitting process can
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
be improved we know that it is
 
01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
inefficient and it can put a burden on
 
01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
the agency heads who serve on the
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
committee however we believe that any
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
changes must retain the important
 
01:41:43.850 --> 01:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
benefits of the current process under
 
01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
the guise of improving the efficiency of
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
Permitting hb609 would eliminate or
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
weaken many Provisions that provide
 
01:41:52.669 --> 01:41:52.679 align:start position:0%
important protection to New Hampshire
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
citizens communities and environment
 
01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
among the specific concerns we have with
 
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation are
 
01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
currently decisions are made by a body
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee that
 
01:42:08.209 --> 01:42:08.219 align:start position:0%
contains a diversity of expertise from
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
different state departments as well as
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
to members of the public ensuring that
 
01:42:14.330 --> 01:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
multiple perspectives will be present
 
01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
during deliberations
 
01:42:19.209 --> 01:42:19.219 align:start position:0%
well the puc has expertise in many areas
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
evaluating impacts to natural and
 
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
cultural resources is not among them
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
eliminating in States resource agencies
 
01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.139 align:start position:0%
and public members from a
 
01:42:30.290 --> 01:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
decision-making role will significantly
 
01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
narrow the scope of discussion during
 
01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:34.129 align:start position:0%
narrow the scope of discussion during
deliberations

01:42:34.129 --> 01:42:34.139 align:start position:0%
deliberations
 
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
and determining whether a project has an
 
01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
unreasonable adverse impact on the
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
natural environment goes far beyond
 
01:42:43.970 --> 01:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
things like Wetlands permits and
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
alteration of trains permits
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
second hb609 would reduce the role of
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
the council for the public which is one
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
of the most important features of the
 
01:42:55.129 --> 01:42:55.139 align:start position:0%
current structure providing a neutral
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
party to represent the public interest
 
01:42:58.850 --> 01:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
in ensuring a full vetting of
 
01:43:00.649 --> 01:43:00.659 align:start position:0%
application materials
 
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
making the council optional at the
 
01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
discretion of the puc in the doe weakens
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
this important protection of the public
 
01:43:07.679 --> 01:43:09.950 align:start position:0%
this important protection of the public
interest

01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
and finally hb609 would eliminate the
 
01:43:15.290 --> 01:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
current SEC rules that were developed in
 
01:43:18.490 --> 01:43:18.500 align:start position:0%
2015 with significant public involvement
 
01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
these rules include extensive guidance
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
on application requirements as well as
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
factors that must be considered in
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
making the required findings there is
 
01:43:29.209 --> 01:43:29.219 align:start position:0%
the potential that the new rules that
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
would have to be adopted by the puc
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
could weaken consideration of many
 
01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
environmental and social impacts
 
01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
we urge the sponsor to withdraw this
 
01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
legislation and work with the full range
 
01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:42.659 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders to identify potential
 
01:43:44.209 --> 01:43:44.219 align:start position:0%
improvements to the energy facility
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
permitting process that repaint these
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
important components this legislation
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
rather than making targeted beneficial
 
01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
adjustments takes to throw the baby out
 
01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
with the bathwater approach that would
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
undo the hard work done less than a
 
01:43:59.450 --> 01:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
decade ago and lead to an uncertain
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
result with potentially negative
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
consequences for New Hampshire's
 
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
communities and environment
 
01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
this committee should vote the bill in
 
01:44:09.530 --> 01:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and we thank you
 
01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:11.159 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question if I understand
 
01:44:27.229 --> 01:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
correctly you said that there are
 
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts or potential
 
01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts that that go
 
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
beyond what Des would be permitting or
 
01:44:36.649 --> 01:44:36.659 align:start position:0%
or is in charge of Permitting I'm
 
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can provide us with
 
01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
some examples please yeah there are many
 
01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
things uh
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
such as impacts to rare plants and
 
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
natural communities which have no
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
statutory protection uh impacts of
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
habitat fragmentation which are not uh
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned in any legislation or
 
01:44:57.649 --> 01:44:57.659 align:start position:0%
statutory protection other than the SEC
 
01:44:59.629 --> 01:44:59.639 align:start position:0%
rules as a factor that must be
 
01:45:02.770 --> 01:45:02.780 align:start position:0%
considered so these are some examples of
 
01:45:06.590 --> 01:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
broader uh environmental impacts that
 
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
are not specifically covered in statute
 
01:45:10.609 --> 01:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
and are not specifically protected
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
resources but form part of the the
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
larger issue of an unreasonable adverse
 
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
impact on the natural environment
 
01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.810 align:start position:0%
impact on the natural environment
follow-up

01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:45:23.689 --> 01:45:23.699 align:start position:0%
thank you have these issues actually
 
01:45:26.689 --> 01:45:26.699 align:start position:0%
come up in previous SEC deliberations
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
yes they have uh in many of the ones
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
we've done uh in the permitting of uh
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
the granite reliable wind project which
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
we initially opposed in part but
 
01:45:40.729 --> 01:45:40.739 align:start position:0%
ultimately ended up withdrawing that
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
that opposition uh one of the
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
significant impacts was on high
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
elevation habitat for bicknell's thrush
 
01:45:49.330 --> 01:45:49.340 align:start position:0%
which is one of the rarest migratory
 
01:45:53.209 --> 01:45:53.219 align:start position:0%
songbirds in the United States but which
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
is not it designated endangered species
 
01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:58.669 align:start position:0%
is not it designated endangered species
uh

01:45:58.669 --> 01:45:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
the project was required to uh do
 
01:46:04.490 --> 01:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
considerable compensatory protection of
 
01:46:07.129 --> 01:46:07.139 align:start position:0%
high elevation habitat as compensation
 
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
for the impacts again New Hampshire
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
fishing game was though not a member of
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
the SEC was actively involved in that
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
and it's it's unclear whether the puc
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
would have the you know how they would
 
01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
approach something that's outside their
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:28.129 --> 01:46:28.139 align:start position:0%
certainly uh impacts to rare species and
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
natural communities were a large issue
 
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the northern pass process though that
 
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
the SEC decision never got to the point
 
01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
of making a finding on impacts to the
 
01:46:43.729 --> 01:46:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
sorry uh representative Wendy Thomas has
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
a question thank you
 
01:46:51.530 --> 01:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair
 
01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm intrigued with these um aspects
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
that are not covered by um permitting um
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
with the northern pass I assume some of
 
01:47:03.649 --> 01:47:03.659 align:start position:0%
these these uh topics were raised rare
 
01:47:06.590 --> 01:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
plants endangered uh animals that kind
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
um how were they raised if they weren't
 
01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
covered by the permitting did the public
 
01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
raise them well they were raised by by
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
interveners uh I believe fish and games
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
input discussed them though I think they
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
believe that appropriate accommodations
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
were made but again if we rely on Des to
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
cover the environmental permitting
 
01:47:32.689 --> 01:47:32.699 align:start position:0%
again the impacts to rare plants and
 
01:47:35.229 --> 01:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
natural communities are not specifically
 
01:47:37.970 --> 01:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
statutorily protected they fall under
 
01:47:40.729 --> 01:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
the broader purview of the the required
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
finding oh follow-up
 
01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes so would you say that the
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
input from
 
01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:48.189 align:start position:0%
input from
um

01:47:48.189 --> 01:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
non-agencies in the public has served
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
well in this process
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
I think it has I think it's raised
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
important issues and it's you know it's
 
01:47:59.209 --> 01:47:59.219 align:start position:0%
brought information to the process uh
 
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
you know certainly The Nature
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
Conservancy brought a lot of important
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
information to the process uh so I think
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
maintaining that level of public input
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
is important
 
01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:12.169 --> 01:48:12.179 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:13.860 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:48:20.209 --> 01:48:20.219 align:start position:0%
so if I understand you you had you
 
01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
meaning the public had a voice in
 
01:48:24.169 --> 01:48:24.179 align:start position:0%
Northern Pass and brought up some of
 
01:48:26.330 --> 01:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
some of those issues even though they
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
weren't statutorily required
 
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
and from what I've heard today there has
 
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
been no lusting of public input in this
 
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
new bill
 
01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
why would you think that you would not
 
01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
have any say so in any of the subjects
 
01:48:45.890 --> 01:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
that you brought up since the public is
 
01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
going to have as much input ability as
 
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
we heard from the previous testimonies
 
01:48:53.689 --> 01:48:53.699 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of bringing the
 
01:48:56.810 --> 01:48:56.820 align:start position:0%
information into the process you know as
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
long as the right of
 
01:49:01.609 --> 01:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
the public to intervene uh is maintained
 
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
in the legislation that will be there
 
01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of who gets to make the
 
01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
decision and reducing the resource
 
01:49:09.649 --> 01:49:09.659 align:start position:0%
agencies which have greater expertise in
 
01:49:11.570 --> 01:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
this issues from a decision-making
 
01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
process you know part of the
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
decision-making body to an information
 
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
providing body we think lessens the
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
consideration that these issues may get
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
during the decision making because the
 
01:49:25.370 --> 01:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
puc is that's not
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know they know how to run a process
 
01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
but impacts to the natural environment
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
is not where their expertise lies
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
so again it's a matter of who gets to
 
01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions from
 
01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
the committee I want to thank you for
 
01:49:44.510 --> 01:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
offering your perspective on this
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
legislation here today
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
and next we'll get some perspective from
 
01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:50.450 align:start position:0%
and next we'll get some perspective from
the

01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:54.659 align:start position:0%
uh labor union committee alcohol on Alan
 
01:50:04.370 --> 01:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.609 --> 01:50:06.619 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
01:50:08.689 --> 01:50:08.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman honorable
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Alan RAF
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm come before you here on behalf
 
01:50:15.169 --> 01:50:15.179 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire AFL-CIO and our
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
over 35 000 members in the state of New
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to urge you to vote to pass on
 
01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:22.370 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to urge you to vote to pass on
hb609

01:50:22.370 --> 01:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
hb609
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
um energy facilities in New Hampshire
 
01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
are extremely complicated the process is
 
01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
a thorough and multi-faceted process
 
01:50:31.010 --> 01:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
which is necessary to ensure that the
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
projects that are approved truly do
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
benefit our state
 
01:50:36.530 --> 01:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
when a new energy infrastructure project
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
is approved it's not only the New
 
01:50:40.250 --> 01:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rate payers and taxpayers that
 
01:50:42.169 --> 01:50:42.179 align:start position:0%
benefit from these projects but also New
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire workers
 
01:50:46.490 --> 01:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
so typically energy developers partner
 
01:50:48.290 --> 01:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
with trade unions to ensure that the
 
01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
project is constructed with the best
 
01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
trained and experienced trades people
 
01:50:53.689 --> 01:50:53.699 align:start position:0%
and because trade unions ongoing
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
training and focus on worker safety
 
01:50:57.950 --> 01:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
um because many of these projects
 
01:51:00.169 --> 01:51:00.179 align:start position:0%
require a large number of workers unions
 
01:51:01.970 --> 01:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
manage Staffing to ensure there are
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
workers enough workers to keep
 
01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
construction schedules on track and to
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
minimize delays on those projects it
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
takes thousands of workers plan build
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
and after completion maintain these
 
01:51:13.370 --> 01:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
finished products New Hampshire AFL-CIO
 
01:51:15.169 --> 01:51:15.179 align:start position:0%
represents tens of thousands of people
 
01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:16.860 align:start position:0%
that would make up the prospective
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce on these projects
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
so that's why we support the bill
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
because these projects have not been
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
happening and we have a great need for
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
energy infrastructure in the state our
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
organization's membership is made up of
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
electricians linemen laborers
 
01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
longshoremen Carpenters painters and
 
01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
Engineers that will ensure that these
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
projects are built on time on budget and
 
01:51:37.970 --> 01:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
within the guidelines that these
 
01:51:39.770 --> 01:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
projects should be completed as far as
 
01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
safety maintaining how these uh in the
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
case of endangered animals or plants to
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
make sure that these projects are in
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
compliance with keeping them safe and
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
making sure that the projects that are
 
01:51:53.330 --> 01:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
built are you know they're protecting
 
01:51:55.490 --> 01:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
the habitats of these animals and these
 
01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.229 align:start position:0%
the habitats of these animals and these
plants

01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
plants
 
01:51:57.239 --> 01:51:57.830 align:start position:0%
plants
um

01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:59.330 --> 01:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
the jobs that come with these projects
 
01:52:01.490 --> 01:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
are New Hampshire jobs meaning that they
 
01:52:03.169 --> 01:52:03.179 align:start position:0%
go to local workers in the community in
 
01:52:04.669 --> 01:52:04.679 align:start position:0%
which these projects are being developed
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
these projects give good jobs and they
 
01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
come with benefits and retirement plans
 
01:52:11.689 --> 01:52:11.699 align:start position:0%
health insurance as well
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
as well as the added benefit of being
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
able to work where you live where many
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
of our workers have to take jobs that
 
01:52:18.590 --> 01:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
are hundreds of thou or thousands of
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
miles away from New Hampshire away from
 
01:52:21.590 --> 01:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
their families away from the New
 
01:52:23.330 --> 01:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy away from the rest of
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
their lives
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
um over the years various unions have
 
01:52:28.189 --> 01:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
participated in the site evaluation
 
01:52:30.050 --> 01:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
committee process on projects that
 
01:52:32.209 --> 01:52:32.219 align:start position:0%
impact our membership and Union
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
participation has come in the form of
 
01:52:36.590 --> 01:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
public input serving as expert Witnesses
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
or participating in the docket as full
 
01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:39.950 align:start position:0%
or participating in the docket as full
interveners

01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
interveners
 
01:52:42.050 --> 01:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
I personally served as an attorney for
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
the ibw and their capacity as
 
01:52:46.490 --> 01:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
interveners in these cases and from my
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
experience and the experience of others
 
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
who've worked on uh worked through this
 
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
process we've developed several concerns
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
that we believe hb609 takes steps to
 
01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
address one the role of the SEC and it's
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
important to the state citizens and our
 
01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
workers has grown to require more than
 
01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
just a part-time committee structure
 
01:53:05.689 --> 01:53:05.699 align:start position:0%
given the importance of these issues and
 
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
expert panel supported with professional
 
01:53:09.229 --> 01:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
staff is needed and while it's not
 
01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
addressed in hv609 we believe that it is
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
also crucial that the state provide
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
resources to adequately staff the SEC as
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard before and I know that the
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
concern a lot of people in the room who
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this bill is that the
 
01:53:22.609 --> 01:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
public is not going to have their voices
 
01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
heard or their concerns have a place
 
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
where they're actually taken into
 
01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
consideration when making a decision on
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
citing the project but I would also
 
01:53:34.669 --> 01:53:34.679 align:start position:0%
posit that Mr Beamer is the only staff
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
member at the SEC officially and I think
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
that the public might be better served
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
by having more support more resources of
 
01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
the puc and all the others who would be
 
01:53:46.609 --> 01:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
involved if this legislation is passed
 
01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
to actually take all their concerns read
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of pages of testimony the
 
01:53:53.149 --> 01:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
evidence and the compelling stuff that
 
01:53:55.209 --> 01:53:55.219 align:start position:0%
everyone who participates in the process
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
expects all the members that are going
 
01:53:59.689 --> 01:53:59.699 align:start position:0%
to make these decisions and who are
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
weighing in on them actually read and
 
01:54:03.590 --> 01:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
take the time to understand and just
 
01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
having Mr Beamer to go through sort
 
01:54:07.729 --> 01:54:07.739 align:start position:0%
through all the stuff by himself I think
 
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
is a difficult thing with all this
 
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
information that comes through number
 
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
two transferring the adjudicative duties
 
01:54:15.229 --> 01:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
of the SEC to the puc would provide
 
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
consistency and expertise that can be
 
01:54:19.609 --> 01:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
lacking in the current process as we've
 
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
talked about before that's currently
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
structured the sitting members the SEC
 
01:54:25.010 --> 01:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
can handle any there can include any
 
01:54:26.689 --> 01:54:26.699 align:start position:0%
number of people in over the past few
 
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
years upward of 40 different people have
 
01:54:30.649 --> 01:54:30.659 align:start position:0%
served as SC member SCC members on
 
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
various dockets even with these people
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
many times getting a quorum for these
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
SEC hearings is a problem as we've heard
 
01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
that's cause unexpected delays and that
 
01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
costs money for the people who are
 
01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
involved patches the businesses that are
 
01:54:45.169 --> 01:54:45.179 align:start position:0%
involved but also the interveners who've
 
01:54:47.090 --> 01:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
hired attorneys the members of public
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
who have spent days months years in some
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
cases coming down to sit through these
 
01:54:52.199 --> 01:54:53.930 align:start position:0%
cases coming down to sit through these
hearings

01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
um three and finally uh hb609 maintains
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
an application and review process that
 
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
provides Clarity to the applicants and
 
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
the interested parties these can be
 
01:55:04.850 --> 01:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
extremely complex projects not only in
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
terms of permitting but engineering
 
01:55:08.689 --> 01:55:08.699 align:start position:0%
ordering and securing equipment and
 
01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
ensuring required lab labor is available
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
unions we work far in advance to ensure
 
01:55:15.470 --> 01:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
adequate labor is lined up for these
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
projects and as such we need to be able
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
to rely on a clear permitting process so
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
it is for these reasons this New
 
01:55:24.010 --> 01:55:24.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire AFL-CIO asks you to support
 
01:55:27.229 --> 01:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
hb609 and I'd be happy to take any
 
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your prospective
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question just a quick one so
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
what you were stating there not
 
01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
Financial stood correctly the delays and
 
01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
the current current site processing have
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
had an effect on our New Hampshire trade
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
unions correct oh yeah absolutely
 
01:55:51.290 --> 01:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:55:55.129 --> 01:55:55.139 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
01:55:58.070 --> 01:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me if the AFL-CIO has
 
01:56:00.770 --> 01:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
any objections or concerns with recent
 
01:56:02.570 --> 01:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
projects that have been authorized by
 
01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
the current SEC
 
01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
I I can't speak can you be more specific
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to get that answer to
 
01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
you as far as which projects but there
 
01:56:12.290 --> 01:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
are some no I'm saying if you could tell
 
01:56:13.729 --> 01:56:13.739 align:start position:0%
me which projects you're referring to
 
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to ask if
 
01:56:17.689 --> 01:56:17.699 align:start position:0%
a follow-up our membership has had
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
issues okay follow up for clarification
 
01:56:22.669 --> 01:56:22.679 align:start position:0%
yes I I think that um in your testimony
 
01:56:22.679 --> 01:56:23.629 align:start position:0%
yes I I think that um in your testimony
you

01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
um raised objections or concerns uh for
 
01:56:29.689 --> 01:56:29.699 align:start position:0%
projects and not so I'm just wondering
 
01:56:31.370 --> 01:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
where that came from is that are you
 
01:56:32.770 --> 01:56:32.780 align:start position:0%
projecting that there might be
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
objections and concerns or is that based
 
01:56:36.890 --> 01:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
on history oh no we no I wasn't saying
 
01:56:39.050 --> 01:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
that we had okay I wasn't saying that no
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
okay seeing a representative Christian
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:48.050 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:56:49.970 --> 01:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
um so as you mentioned and as we've
 
01:56:51.530 --> 01:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
heard you know there's a lot of concerns
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
that this process is very slow because
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
there just aren't enough people with the
 
01:56:57.649 --> 01:56:57.659 align:start position:0%
expertise or with the time to address
 
01:56:57.659 --> 01:56:58.790 align:start position:0%
expertise or with the time to address
them

01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:57:00.530 --> 01:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm still concerned that you
 
01:57:02.209 --> 01:57:02.219 align:start position:0%
know if this is just getting uh dumped
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
on three puc members we're still going
 
01:57:06.770 --> 01:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
to have this problem we have to fund new
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
positions to support these cases anyway
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
so why not keep it as it is and just
 
01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679 align:start position:0%
fund some more support versus
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
putting it into the state government
 
01:57:19.490 --> 01:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
that already has other responsibilities
 
01:57:20.930 --> 01:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your question
 
01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:22.070 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your question
representative

01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:25.370 --> 01:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
um so I think what many of you I don't
 
01:57:26.689 --> 01:57:26.699 align:start position:0%
know how familiar you are with the
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
process or the how the MCC actually runs
 
01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
and what goes on day to day but it's
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
already uh like I said there's one staff
 
01:57:37.010 --> 01:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
member there and that person has a bunch
 
01:57:38.089 --> 01:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
of other people that they have to
 
01:57:39.709 --> 01:57:39.719 align:start position:0%
basically ask on a volunteer basis to
 
01:57:41.450 --> 01:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
help them out sorting through all this
 
01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:42.470 align:start position:0%
help them out sorting through all this
stuff

01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:57:46.490 --> 01:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
um so I would say that under this new
 
01:57:47.930 --> 01:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
process the way that this bill is
 
01:57:49.490 --> 01:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
proposed that there would be more
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
support and even if you weren't to hire
 
01:57:54.649 --> 01:57:54.659 align:start position:0%
anybody else there would be it to have
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
some of the weight go to not just three
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
members because the way to think about
 
01:57:58.910 --> 01:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
it isn't just that these three people
 
01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
are going to be doing all the work it's
 
01:58:02.089 --> 01:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
going to be everything else and it comes
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
into the process through this bill and
 
01:58:06.649 --> 01:58:06.659 align:start position:0%
it wasn't just the SEC members doing the
 
01:58:08.810 --> 01:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
work it was also the administrator and
 
01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
the administrator's staff which
 
01:58:11.570 --> 01:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
currently is lacking the position was
 
01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
open for two years before Mr Beamer was
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions for Mr
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
RAF I want to thank you for being here
 
01:58:23.810 --> 01:58:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you next we'll get the perspective
 
01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
of The Nature Conservancy from Ms
 
01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:40.129 --> 01:58:40.139 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning chairman Vos
 
01:58:42.169 --> 01:58:42.179 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas and members of the
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
committee I do have a testimony letter
 
01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
that's making its way around
 
01:58:48.890 --> 01:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to start off by agreeing
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
with a few of the comments that have
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
made been made earlier we do agree with
 
01:58:54.709 --> 01:58:54.719 align:start position:0%
and sorry I'm Meredith Hatfield
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
representing the nature conservancy we
 
01:58:59.570 --> 01:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
agree with Mr locata from eversource
 
01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:00.709 align:start position:0%
agree with Mr locata from eversource
that

01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:02.810 --> 01:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
um in that we also want to clear and
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
understandable citing process
 
01:59:07.490 --> 01:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
and it's actually been a kind of
 
01:59:10.490 --> 01:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
exciting conversation this morning with
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
folks from a lot of different groups
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
including several legislators remarking
 
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
about our need to ensure that New
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't lose out on federal
 
01:59:23.689 --> 01:59:23.699 align:start position:0%
funds that could be coming to us and
 
01:59:25.850 --> 01:59:25.860 align:start position:0%
also a great discussion about the need
 
01:59:29.149 --> 01:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
for us to more rapidly deploy clean
 
01:59:29.159 --> 01:59:31.430 align:start position:0%
for us to more rapidly deploy clean
energy

01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:59:33.649 --> 01:59:33.659 align:start position:0%
um I have not had the opportunity to see
 
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment so our testimony letter
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
does focus on the bill as um
 
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
as it originally was drafted
 
01:59:46.729 --> 01:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to try to just cover things
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
that other people haven't so on page two
 
01:59:53.089 --> 01:59:53.099 align:start position:0%
of our letter
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to raise just some questions
 
01:59:58.250 --> 01:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
about agency roles
 
01:59:58.260 --> 01:59:58.910 align:start position:0%
about agency roles
um

01:59:58.910 --> 01:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
I do understand I think that the
 
02:00:04.729 --> 02:00:04.739 align:start position:0%
amendment uh chairman Vos you just said
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago moves the
 
02:00:09.169 --> 02:00:09.179 align:start position:0%
administrator to the puc which we think
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
is appropriate and we actually agree
 
02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
with the comments that were just made by
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
the AFL-CIO
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
about the need to adequately staff the
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
function wherever it it
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
um it ends up being
 
02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:27.709 align:start position:0%
um it ends up being
um

02:00:27.709 --> 02:00:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:30.410 --> 02:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
in terms of public deliberations I
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that an important
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
part of the SEC is that it is required
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
to deliberate in public however and I've
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
provided you the statutory site the puc
 
02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:40.850 align:start position:0%
provided you the statutory site the puc
has

02:00:40.850 --> 02:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:00:42.649 --> 02:00:42.659 align:start position:0%
um an exception under the right to no
 
02:00:44.570 --> 02:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
law so the puc doesn't have to
 
02:00:46.970 --> 02:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
deliberate in public
 
02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:47.930 align:start position:0%
deliberate in public
um

02:00:47.930 --> 02:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
and we think that it is a really
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
important aspect of the SEC that it does
 
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
have to deliberate in public so we would
 
02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:55.550 align:start position:0%
have to deliberate in public so we would
ask

02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
ask
 
02:00:57.530 --> 02:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
that if you do move forward with this
 
02:01:02.209 --> 02:01:02.219 align:start position:0%
bill that you would make that very clear
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
another aspect is the important role of
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
council for the public and House Bill
 
02:01:07.199 --> 02:01:08.589 align:start position:0%
council for the public and House Bill
609

02:01:08.589 --> 02:01:08.599 align:start position:0%
609
 
02:01:08.599 --> 02:01:10.270 align:start position:0%
609
changes

02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:01:12.890 --> 02:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
that decision about Council for the
 
02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
public being appointed changes the word
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
shall to May and allows it to be a
 
02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
discretionary decision of the doe and we
 
02:01:22.970 --> 02:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
would urge you to to continue to have
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
that be required so to use the word
 
02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:26.810 align:start position:0%
that be required so to use the word
shall

02:01:26.810 --> 02:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
shall
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
and I think that also raises some
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
questions for us around roles of
 
02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:33.070 align:start position:0%
questions for us around roles of
agencies

02:01:33.070 --> 02:01:33.080 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
02:01:36.410 --> 02:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
and if the doe is going to make a
 
02:01:38.450 --> 02:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
decision about public counsel but the
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
doe Also may be a party in a case we
 
02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
think that that raises some questions
 
02:01:44.649 --> 02:01:44.659 align:start position:0%
that really should be thought through
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
very carefully
 
02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
another issue about the duties and the
 
02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:51.950 align:start position:0%
another issue about the duties and the
roles

02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
roles
 
02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:52.609 align:start position:0%
roles
um

02:01:52.609 --> 02:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
relates to the whether the doe would be
 
02:01:55.679 --> 02:01:57.169 align:start position:0%
relates to the whether the doe would be
participating

02:01:57.169 --> 02:01:57.179 align:start position:0%
participating
 
02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
and would they also have to enforce and
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
how would the communication work between
 
02:02:06.169 --> 02:02:06.179 align:start position:0%
the puc and the doe I'm sure that
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
they've been navigating those issues
 
02:02:11.209 --> 02:02:11.219 align:start position:0%
since the the agency was created last
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
year but I think it's really important
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
for the public and for interveners to
 
02:02:18.410 --> 02:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
understand who we can talk to and when
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
so could we talk to the administrator
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
clearly you can't talk to a puc
 
02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner but would you be able to
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
talk to someone at doe so I think
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
spending some time thinking about
 
02:02:33.609 --> 02:02:33.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:36.770 --> 02:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
funding I did just mention that we we
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
agree that this is an important public
 
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
purpose and we were pleased to see that
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
General funds would be allocated to the
 
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
citing work we did find it to be a
 
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
little bit unclear around the use of the
 
02:02:55.129 --> 02:02:55.139 align:start position:0%
filing fees because I think that section
 
02:02:57.649 --> 02:02:57.659 align:start position:0%
18 of the bill
 
02:03:01.490 --> 02:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
related to funding excuse me says that
 
02:03:03.890 --> 02:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
monitoring and enforcement activities of
 
02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
doe would be funded by the filing fees
 
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of the duties would be
 
02:03:10.729 --> 02:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
General funded so we wanted to point out
 
02:03:12.530 --> 02:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
that that was a little bit unclear to us
 
02:03:15.609 --> 02:03:15.619 align:start position:0%
and we also wondered how
 
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
the doj's costs related to providing
 
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
public counsel how those would be paid
 
02:03:22.970 --> 02:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
for and if any other agencies would be
 
02:03:24.890 --> 02:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
able to recover the cost of
 
02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:27.470 align:start position:0%
able to recover the cost of
participating

02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
participating
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
um regarding rulemaking and the
 
02:03:32.830 --> 02:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
effective date if House Bill 609 passes
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
it has an effective date of 60 days and
 
02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
we think that that is
 
02:03:41.450 --> 02:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
um not enough time to develop rules and
 
02:03:45.649 --> 02:03:45.659 align:start position:0%
also ensure an appropriate transition
 
02:03:49.129 --> 02:03:49.139 align:start position:0%
and we also share the views that AMC
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
just raised about the the importance of
 
02:03:55.850 --> 02:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
the rules there are a lot of issues
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
covered in the rules as authorized by
 
02:04:01.729 --> 02:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
existing provisions of the statute that
 
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't appear to be in House Bill 609
 
02:04:09.649 --> 02:04:09.659 align:start position:0%
that we would urge you to include to
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
02:04:13.550 --> 02:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
some of the things that the AMC raised
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
in its testimony are still going to be a
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
part of the process because obviously
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of benefits from energy
 
02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
infrastructure but I think it's um it's
 
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
important that we consider the
 
02:04:30.109 --> 02:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
the potentially negative impacts and
 
02:04:33.530 --> 02:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
have plans to mitigate those
 
02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:34.850 align:start position:0%
have plans to mitigate those
foreign

02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
with respect to the members of the SEC I
 
02:04:39.709 --> 02:04:39.719 align:start position:0%
had the privilege of serving on the SEC
 
02:04:42.410 --> 02:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
myself at one point when I was in state
 
02:04:44.930 --> 02:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
service and I really did benefit greatly
 
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
from the different perspectives that
 
02:04:50.689 --> 02:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
were brought by different agencies and I
 
02:04:52.490 --> 02:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
would say particularly those that don't
 
02:04:55.010 --> 02:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
have a permitting requirement and so
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
don't have sort of a regulatory
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
Authority but who have
 
02:04:59.159 --> 02:04:59.689 align:start position:0%
Authority but who have
um

02:04:59.689 --> 02:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:03.250 --> 02:05:03.260 align:start position:0%
deep expertise on economic development
 
02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:04.810 align:start position:0%
deep expertise on economic development
Transportation

02:05:04.810 --> 02:05:04.820 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
02:05:07.850 --> 02:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
cultural resources and I know fish and
 
02:05:09.770 --> 02:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
game was was mentioned previously and
 
02:05:13.370 --> 02:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:15.410 --> 02:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
and in terms of the signal that New
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is sending to developers I
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
would respectfully suggest that while
 
02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
our citing process certainly could be
 
02:05:25.070 --> 02:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
improved some of our other foundational
 
02:05:28.070 --> 02:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
laws like the RPS and our lack of a
 
02:05:30.669 --> 02:05:30.679 align:start position:0%
climate plan are really what is sending
 
02:05:34.250 --> 02:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
a negative signal to people who might be
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
investing here
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
um so we would suggest that you find
 
02:05:41.390 --> 02:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
this bill in expedient to legislate due
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
to all of these issues or if the
 
02:05:46.070 --> 02:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
committee wishes to move forward with
 
02:05:47.629 --> 02:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
this idea
 
02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
to retain the bill and do some further
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
work on it I also wanted to just point
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
out that attorney Amy manzelli had to
 
02:05:58.850 --> 02:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
leave but she did submit a letter she
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
has significant experience in several
 
02:06:03.370 --> 02:06:03.380 align:start position:0%
several proceedings at the P at the SEC
 
02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:06.179 align:start position:0%
so I would commend to you her very brief
 
02:06:06.179 --> 02:06:07.189 align:start position:0%
so I would commend to you her very brief
letter

02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
letter
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
and then I also I have studied the study
 
02:06:12.129 --> 02:06:12.139 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
which does make quite a few
 
02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:15.589 align:start position:0%
which does make quite a few
recommendations

02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
02:06:18.290 --> 02:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
um that aren't in House Bill 609 and I
 
02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:19.129 align:start position:0%
um that aren't in House Bill 609 and I
did

02:06:19.129 --> 02:06:19.139 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:06:21.709 --> 02:06:21.719 align:start position:0%
find it interesting that Senator Ruth
 
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
Ward who I believe was the chair of that
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
um most recent study committee did sign
 
02:06:29.270 --> 02:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
in opposed to this bill I was hoping to
 
02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
hear today what her concerns were but um
 
02:06:35.330 --> 02:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard them yet
 
02:06:37.370 --> 02:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:38.270 align:start position:0%
and I think
um

02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:41.450 --> 02:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
just to give you a statutory site on the
 
02:06:43.729 --> 02:06:43.739 align:start position:0%
sections that provide rulemaking
 
02:06:43.739 --> 02:06:45.890 align:start position:0%
sections that provide rulemaking
Direction

02:06:45.890 --> 02:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
Direction
 
02:06:52.129 --> 02:06:52.139 align:start position:0%
um it is 162h 10 a which is related to
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
wind and
 
02:06:57.770 --> 02:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
162h10b which is related to gas
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
pipelines and we think
 
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:00.830 align:start position:0%
pipelines and we think
um

02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:03.229 --> 02:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
it would be great and if the law was
 
02:07:05.570 --> 02:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
changed to take some of those criteria
 
02:07:08.570 --> 02:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
that are so important and make them
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
apply to all projects
 
02:07:14.450 --> 02:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
and I think that's all I had thank you
 
02:07:16.669 --> 02:07:16.679 align:start position:0%
questions representative Summers has a
 
02:07:18.770 --> 02:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:07:20.570 --> 02:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you mentioned
 
02:07:22.490 --> 02:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
there in your testimony that you were a
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
member of the SEC while you were a
 
02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
member of that committee did you ever
 
02:07:29.209 --> 02:07:29.219 align:start position:0%
witness the committee unable to be able
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
to create a quorum
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:33.119 --> 02:07:33.890 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:36.050 align:start position:0%
um
I

02:07:36.050 --> 02:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
it definitely
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
to have that many members from different
 
02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
agencies be able to get together but I
 
02:07:45.770 --> 02:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
would also point out you know the puc
 
02:07:48.290 --> 02:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
does struggle with that as well and I
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
think there are some dockets
 
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
um the grid modernization docket I think
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure if it's closed but it
 
02:07:56.810 --> 02:07:56.820 align:start position:0%
was started in 2015 I think and doesn't
 
02:07:59.390 --> 02:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
have a conclusion and I know the current
 
02:08:02.330 --> 02:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
default service investigation was
 
02:08:03.770 --> 02:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
supposed to have a tech session last
 
02:08:07.129 --> 02:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
week and was rescheduled to April so I
 
02:08:11.330 --> 02:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
think it's a common challenge but
 
02:08:13.490 --> 02:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
I certainly think that the process could
 
02:08:16.010 --> 02:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
be improved
 
02:08:18.169 --> 02:08:18.179 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:08:20.209 --> 02:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
02:08:23.390 --> 02:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
um it it sounds pretty clear that that
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
we need to make some changes to the
 
02:08:27.229 --> 02:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
committee and or process
 
02:08:27.239 --> 02:08:28.010 align:start position:0%
committee and or process
um

02:08:28.010 --> 02:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh on point four on page two of your
 
02:08:34.010 --> 02:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
printout um you you talk about the
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
council for the public and you're you're
 
02:08:39.050 --> 02:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
urging us to use the word shall
 
02:08:41.689 --> 02:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
um I've noticed that you've not included
 
02:08:44.570 --> 02:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate are you open to
 
02:08:47.209 --> 02:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
including the consumer Advocate as a
 
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
shall partner in this process
 
02:08:51.950 --> 02:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that question and I I
 
02:08:53.810 --> 02:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
also had the privilege of serving as the
 
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate a number of years ago
 
02:08:57.770 --> 02:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
traditionally the OCA
 
02:09:04.030 --> 02:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
because it is charged with representing
 
02:09:07.689 --> 02:09:07.699 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers and SEC
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
proceedings don't involve rates
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
um that they the legislature didn't
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
contemplate a role but I I don't know if
 
02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
if a consumer Advocate has actually
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
tried to participate because perhaps the
 
02:09:23.330 --> 02:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
SEC would have allowed it
 
02:09:24.970 --> 02:09:24.980 align:start position:0%
um I do think that
 
02:09:29.930 --> 02:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
moving if you moved the SEC to the puc
 
02:09:32.770 --> 02:09:32.780 align:start position:0%
it might be that the OCA would already
 
02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
automatically be able to participate the
 
02:09:37.129 --> 02:09:37.139 align:start position:0%
way that they do today in puc
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
proceedings there is
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
um a memorandum of understanding between
 
02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
the two agencies that allows the OCA
 
02:09:47.089 --> 02:09:47.099 align:start position:0%
um to participate anytime that
 
02:09:49.450 --> 02:09:49.460 align:start position:0%
residential customers would be impacted
 
02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure it needs to be
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
explicitly in there but I would
 
02:09:58.070 --> 02:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
certainly defer to um to Mr crease on
 
02:10:01.250 --> 02:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
that follow-up would you like to see the
 
02:10:02.930 --> 02:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate included in this
 
02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:05.870 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate included in this
process

02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:07.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:10:07.970 --> 02:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:10.850 --> 02:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
you know it is a small agency with a lot
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
of of work to do before the puc
 
02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:15.229 align:start position:0%
of of work to do before the puc
um

02:10:15.229 --> 02:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
and if rate if a energy facility is
 
02:10:23.689 --> 02:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
being cited and rate payers are not
 
02:10:26.450 --> 02:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
contributing and and you know the rates
 
02:10:29.810 --> 02:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be considered in an SEC case
 
02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
it's necessary I think if there were to
 
02:10:37.490 --> 02:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
be a proposal for a power purchase
 
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
agreement between a utility and a
 
02:10:41.089 --> 02:10:41.099 align:start position:0%
project that was cited that would go
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
before the puc and the OCA would
 
02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:44.930 align:start position:0%
before the puc and the OCA would
certainly

02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
um participate uh Mr crease I did speak
 
02:10:51.169 --> 02:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
with him about this and he did
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
um make a really good point that it
 
02:10:55.609 --> 02:10:55.619 align:start position:0%
might be useful for the OCA to be at the
 
02:10:57.890 --> 02:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
table at the outset so that when they
 
02:11:00.050 --> 02:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
review the PPA you know they've been
 
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:11:04.129 --> 02:11:04.139 align:start position:0%
participate you know and not it that
 
02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps it could be a foregone
 
02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
conclusion by the time you reach the PPA
 
02:11:10.609 --> 02:11:10.619 align:start position:0%
case representative Carmen has a
 
02:11:10.619 --> 02:11:11.390 align:start position:0%
case representative Carmen has a
question

02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:11:13.010 --> 02:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:11:14.570 --> 02:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
so you've certainly given us several
 
02:11:19.370 --> 02:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
shall we say constructive criticisms of
 
02:11:20.209 --> 02:11:20.219 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:11:22.850 --> 02:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
but one of the basic premises of the
 
02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
bill is to move the site evaluation
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
process just directly into the puc
 
02:11:36.250 --> 02:11:36.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:38.689 --> 02:11:38.699 align:start position:0%
generally I I think it could be done
 
02:11:40.250 --> 02:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other states where
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
the puc has a site citing Authority but
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
without adequate Staffing and just
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
really careful attention to how all of
 
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
those non
 
02:11:55.250 --> 02:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
um utility issues would be addressed you
 
02:11:59.149 --> 02:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
know the the habitat the um economic
 
02:11:59.159 --> 02:12:00.589 align:start position:0%
know the the habitat the um economic
aspects

02:12:00.589 --> 02:12:00.599 align:start position:0%
aspects
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
um you know things that are outside that
 
02:12:05.689 --> 02:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
traditional puc jurisdiction I mean you
 
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
know if I was a commissioner needing to
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
take this on
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
I would want to make sure I had the
 
02:12:16.070 --> 02:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
staff and I had the clear paths to get
 
02:12:18.169 --> 02:12:18.179 align:start position:0%
the input that I needed to rule on
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
things that would be
 
02:12:22.070 --> 02:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know traditionally outside of that
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
air you know traditionally the puc
 
02:12:25.970 --> 02:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
balances the interests of rate payers
 
02:12:28.129 --> 02:12:28.139 align:start position:0%
and utility shareholders
 
02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
they are currently on the SEC so they do
 
02:12:33.169 --> 02:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
serve but I think putting it all under
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
them I would it would be great to hear
 
02:12:37.729 --> 02:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
from them you know how would they
 
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
set up their Staffing and how how would
 
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
they make sure that they got the
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
information they needed to make the
 
02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:51.890 --> 02:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions I want
 
02:12:53.810 --> 02:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
to thank Miss Hatfield for giving us her
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
perspective on this proposed legislation
 
02:12:59.149 --> 02:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
and we'll call next on Joe Casey
 
02:13:03.229 --> 02:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
who represents the IB ew
 
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%

testimony this morning I had prepared
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
but uh in respect of your time I'm just
 
02:13:19.490 --> 02:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
going to I think Mr raft did a great job
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
as far
 
02:13:23.089 --> 02:13:23.099 align:start position:0%

the
 
02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
my my position
 
02:13:44.169 --> 02:13:44.179 align:start position:0%
um is a business development rep is for
 
02:13:46.609 --> 02:13:46.619 align:start position:0%
to work with developers throughout New
 
02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
England in our local unions in the New
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
England states
 
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you um
 
02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
I I'm a resident of New Hampshire but I
 
02:13:57.709 --> 02:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
spend most of my time in our surrounding
 
02:14:00.410 --> 02:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
states and I've had a number of
 
02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
developers tell me that they've they're
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
just not interested in trying to uh uh
 
02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
get things going in in the state of New
 
02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:09.770 align:start position:0%
get things going in in the state of New
Hampshire

02:14:09.770 --> 02:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:14:12.410 --> 02:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
um like I said I represent line workers
 
02:14:14.089 --> 02:14:14.099 align:start position:0%
in electricians in the construction
 
02:14:14.099 --> 02:14:15.290 align:start position:0%
in electricians in the construction
branch

02:14:15.290 --> 02:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
branch
 
02:14:16.729 --> 02:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:14:20.209 --> 02:14:20.219 align:start position:0%
uh we have two local unions here in the
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire one in Concord
 
02:14:24.169 --> 02:14:24.179 align:start position:0%
and one in Barrington with training
 
02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
centers and people that are ready to go
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
and and work in the industry and expand
 
02:14:32.209 --> 02:14:32.219 align:start position:0%
in the industry
 
02:14:35.089 --> 02:14:35.099 align:start position:0%
um but it's been a very difficult I
 
02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
personally uh have been in front of the
 
02:14:38.159 --> 02:14:39.290 align:start position:0%
personally uh have been in front of the
SEC

02:14:39.290 --> 02:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
SEC
 
02:14:42.290 --> 02:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
and testified and uh is cumbersome and
 
02:14:44.209 --> 02:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
very very difficult to do
 
02:14:46.850 --> 02:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
that'll conclude my testimony
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
well thank you we appreciate that
 
02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:50.930 align:start position:0%
well thank you we appreciate that
perspective

02:14:50.930 --> 02:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:14:52.669 --> 02:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
see no questions from the committee
 
02:14:59.450 --> 02:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:05.629 --> 02:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:07.790 --> 02:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
um come to these but is it a coincidence
 
02:15:10.370 --> 02:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
I've been here for an hour and 15
 
02:15:13.370 --> 02:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
minutes and very little of that has been
 
02:15:16.490 --> 02:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
people who are opposed have been given
 
02:15:17.930 --> 02:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to speak and I'm
 
02:15:21.050 --> 02:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
wondering if that's a coincidence or not
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
just I'm I'm trying to mix them in mix
 
02:15:38.810 --> 02:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
well we won't close the proceeding what
 
02:15:45.950 --> 02:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
we may do is we may recess it till next
 
02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:46.970 align:start position:0%
we may do is we may recess it till next
Monday

02:15:46.970 --> 02:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
we won't close it
 
02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:53.750 align:start position:0%
we won't close it
okay

02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
so Jim Monahan from the New England
 
02:15:59.390 --> 02:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
power generous generators Association is
 
02:16:04.990 --> 02:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:07.729 --> 02:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and certainly I
 
02:16:09.050 --> 02:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
will be quick in light of the folks who
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
have traveled here today
 
02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
um I didn't sign up in uh opposition or
 
02:16:14.930 --> 02:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill because
 
02:16:16.490 --> 02:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
um I haven't seen the uh the amendment
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
in any detail
 
02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:16:20.330 --> 02:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
um I do have some experience working
 
02:16:21.770 --> 02:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
with developers before the site
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and that has ranged
 
02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
from the CV C3 project a number of New
 
02:16:29.629 --> 02:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire transmission projects a couple
 
02:16:32.209 --> 02:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
of solar projects uh wind project
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
transfer all these things have gone
 
02:16:35.389 --> 02:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
through the set evaluation committee and
 
02:16:37.969 --> 02:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
so in reading and following what the
 
02:16:40.849 --> 02:16:40.859 align:start position:0%
commission has done uh which led to this
 
02:16:42.410 --> 02:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
legislation there were three things that
 
02:16:44.450 --> 02:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
I was if the legislation is going to go
 
02:16:46.009 --> 02:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
forward there were three things that I
 
02:16:48.650 --> 02:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
was hoping to address and I think some
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
of them are and some of them are not
 
02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
um the first is the question about the
 
02:16:55.370 --> 02:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
um what do you do with uh Apple I do
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
have a client that's going to be filing
 
02:16:58.969 --> 02:16:58.979 align:start position:0%
a 50 megawatt solar project application
 
02:17:01.790 --> 02:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
this spring before the site evaluation
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
committee and we wanted to understand
 
02:17:05.389 --> 02:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
what would happen if the a law changed
 
02:17:07.669 --> 02:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
while the application had been filed I
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
think the legislation addresses that and
 
02:17:11.209 --> 02:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
the second to the last session so
 
02:17:13.849 --> 02:17:13.859 align:start position:0%
section so I appreciate that the other
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
question uh is with regard to the
 
02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
transfer of the certificate when uh one
 
02:17:21.770 --> 02:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
cooperation purchases the power plant
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
from another one there's a change in
 
02:17:26.450 --> 02:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
there in that it trans it looks as
 
02:17:28.429 --> 02:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
though it ensures that that's an
 
02:17:29.929 --> 02:17:29.939 align:start position:0%
administrative proceeding you don't have
 
02:17:31.310 --> 02:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
to go through a long adjudicated
 
02:17:34.610 --> 02:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
proceeding my only question is whether
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
that should be undertaken by by the
 
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
commission or is this more of an
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
Enforcement issue that should be
 
02:17:43.150 --> 02:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
undertaken by the department of energy
 
02:17:46.730 --> 02:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
and I don't have a strong feeling I I
 
02:17:49.730 --> 02:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
haven't read the amendment enough to
 
02:17:52.190 --> 02:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
know if that's that's clear but then the
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
larger issue which I'll touch on today
 
02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
but I don't have a resolution for you is
 
02:17:59.030 --> 02:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
on this question around
 
02:17:59.040 --> 02:17:59.750 align:start position:0%
on this question around
um

02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh how should we deal with uh existing
 
02:18:05.089 --> 02:18:05.099 align:start position:0%
certificate holders these are my clients
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
which are the uh the large power plants
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh if they do uh refuelings make changes
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
put in batteries upgrade their
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
transmission facilities our general view
 
02:18:19.610 --> 02:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
is that we shouldn't take those
 
02:18:22.490 --> 02:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
processes and additions and run them
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
through the whole same process that a
 
02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
Greenfield side would
 
02:18:29.929 --> 02:18:29.939 align:start position:0%
the normal mechanism I guess a mechanism
 
02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
to address that is whether or not the
 
02:18:34.849 --> 02:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
addition is sizable and I do see in the
 
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
amendment there is direction to the
 
02:18:39.849 --> 02:18:39.859 align:start position:0%
commission to come up with a definition
 
02:18:42.849 --> 02:18:42.859 align:start position:0%
of what a sizable addition is
 
02:18:45.169 --> 02:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
because there isn't one in the rules now
 
02:18:47.450 --> 02:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
it's kind of done by historically what
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
they have been I don't know if at some
 
02:18:52.009 --> 02:18:52.019 align:start position:0%
point the legislature might want to
 
02:18:54.349 --> 02:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
offer some direction to the commission
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
on that and then a timeline would be
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
helpful as well I know I'm involved in
 
02:19:01.129 --> 02:19:01.139 align:start position:0%
some roommate Vikings that the Public
 
02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission that are underway
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
that have lasted longer than World War
 
02:19:08.089 --> 02:19:08.099 align:start position:0%
II so a rapid a more rapid process in
 
02:19:10.190 --> 02:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
that front would be helpful but perhaps
 
02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
the more challenging issue is uh if a
 
02:19:17.389 --> 02:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
facility uh is making an addition uh
 
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
it's and it's somewhat sizable
 
02:19:24.410 --> 02:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
um uh uh you know maybe uh in this I
 
02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
think we'll see a lot of this over the
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
next five to ten years where uh because
 
02:19:32.570 --> 02:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
of the uh inflation reduction act
 
02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
there'll be a lot of investment in
 
02:19:36.169 --> 02:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
upgrades to facilities so there's going
 
02:19:38.389 --> 02:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
to be facilities with uh where
 
02:19:38.399 --> 02:19:39.709 align:start position:0%
to be facilities with uh where
certificates

02:19:39.709 --> 02:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
02:19:42.770 --> 02:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
um if they're if they fall inside or
 
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
outside of the sizable question there's
 
02:19:46.969 --> 02:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
two questions here one is if you are
 
02:19:49.490 --> 02:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
deemed not sizable and therefore not
 
02:19:50.810 --> 02:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of the site
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee do you default to
 
02:19:55.610 --> 02:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
just local Planning and Zoning I think
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
folks would want to avoid that because
 
02:20:00.050 --> 02:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
they might not have the expertise to to
 
02:20:03.469 --> 02:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
review it but if you're deemed to be
 
02:20:05.090 --> 02:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction and you're doing
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
something within the same footprint it's
 
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
the same 400 day long process so
 
02:20:15.530 --> 02:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
um that's very much in the weeds and so
 
02:20:16.849 --> 02:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to kind of put that on the
 
02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
table I'm happy to work with the house
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate the Asia the state agencies
 
02:20:24.590 --> 02:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
are working this to try to tease up some
 
02:20:27.170 --> 02:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
of these some particulars
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams has a question
 
02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh real quick so would
 
02:20:37.010 --> 02:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
you consider sizable to be say half the
 
02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
size of the existing facility or greater
 
02:20:40.690 --> 02:20:40.700 align:start position:0%
for an addition
 
02:20:43.250 --> 02:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
I'm working with my clients to try to
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
come up with this and we're looking at
 
02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
both with regard to the footprint of the
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
facility and then perhaps judging it
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
based upon the uh the the name plate so
 
02:20:56.450 --> 02:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
if you and 50 is a number that has been
 
02:20:57.410 --> 02:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
bounced around surrounded if you're
 
02:21:00.770 --> 02:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
underneath the 50 nameplate then it
 
02:21:03.650 --> 02:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
would be deemed not sizable but I'm
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
ahead of my client on that so don't tell
 
02:21:09.410 --> 02:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:11.690 --> 02:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
see no further questions I will thank
 
02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
you and next I'll call on
 
02:21:19.849 --> 02:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Terrace cuckman I'm a
 
02:21:38.090 --> 02:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
resident of 12 Brookwood Drive in
 
02:21:43.730 --> 02:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
Concord I'm a former uh intervener uh
 
02:21:45.849 --> 02:21:45.859 align:start position:0%
and survivor of the northern pass
 
02:21:50.330 --> 02:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
contest I also took part in the SEC
 
02:21:53.690 --> 02:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
activities and in the interest of full
 
02:21:56.690 --> 02:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
disclosure uh in my prior life I was a
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing engineer and a quality
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
engineer and I lived for identifying
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
waste getting rid of it so that we could
 
02:22:09.050 --> 02:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
make things better faster and cheaper
 
02:22:12.410 --> 02:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
having said that I look at this bill and
 
02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
I'm saying what we saw with the SEC was
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
time consuming I agree
 
02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
but my objection
 
02:22:25.130 --> 02:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
to this bill is that it's discounting
 
02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:27.650 align:start position:0%
to this bill is that it's discounting
disqualifying

02:22:27.650 --> 02:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
disqualifying
 
02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:28.370 align:start position:0%
disqualifying
um

02:22:28.370 --> 02:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:31.250 --> 02:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
a voice and a vote
 
02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:32.150 align:start position:0%
a voice and a vote
um

02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate that looking under a
 
02:22:37.790 --> 02:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
microscope but this legislation that all
 
02:22:41.210 --> 02:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
the voices that were heard during the
 
02:22:44.090 --> 02:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
Northern Pass were hurt and going
 
02:22:46.730 --> 02:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
forward I can accept that that will be
 
02:22:49.730 --> 02:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
the case would I do not
 
02:22:49.740 --> 02:22:51.110 align:start position:0%
the case would I do not
believe

02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:22:53.349 --> 02:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
is right is
 
02:22:56.690 --> 02:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
discounting and eliminating the
 
02:22:59.570 --> 02:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
layperson if you will from the actual
 
02:23:04.090 --> 02:23:04.100 align:start position:0%
vote in my prior life I had to convince
 
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
lay people all the time on the specifics
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
of engineering concerns and it was
 
02:23:12.349 --> 02:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon me
 
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
to make them understand before they
 
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
rendered a vote discounting them in this
 
02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
process is not the way to go
 
02:23:25.130 --> 02:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
so I request that you rule in expedient
 
02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
to legislate as it is written I thank
 
02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:30.590 align:start position:0%
to legislate as it is written I thank
you

02:23:30.590 --> 02:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:23:32.990 --> 02:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
if there are any questions if not thank
 
02:23:35.450 --> 02:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
you we appreciate you giving us your
 
02:23:38.690 --> 02:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
perspectives seeing no questions
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:46.010 --> 02:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
Karen Payne
 
02:23:48.349 --> 02:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
of Effingham
 
02:23:50.809 --> 02:23:50.819 align:start position:0%
thank you and Karen would it be
 
02:23:54.410 --> 02:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
acceptable to start imposing a
 
02:23:58.090 --> 02:23:58.100 align:start position:0%
two-minute time limit on testimony
 
02:24:01.610 --> 02:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not I I can't answer that
 
02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:11.110 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not I I can't answer that
question

02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:13.389 --> 02:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll keep going
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you for everything you're doing
 
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that representative Thomas
 
02:24:20.030 --> 02:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
stepped out because I did want to thank
 
02:24:21.530 --> 02:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
him for the point he made at the
 
02:24:21.540 --> 02:24:22.429 align:start position:0%
him for the point he made at the
beginning

02:24:22.429 --> 02:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
02:24:24.770 --> 02:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
we do not want to scare away new energy
 
02:24:24.780 --> 02:24:26.389 align:start position:0%
we do not want to scare away new energy
projects

02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
projects
 
02:24:27.889 --> 02:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
um I was thinking maybe he would be an
 
02:24:29.570 --> 02:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
awesome person to take the lead on
 
02:24:32.510 --> 02:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
looking at page eight and making those
 
02:24:34.370 --> 02:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
figures more attractive for some of
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
these renewable energy projects to come
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire but
 
02:24:40.730 --> 02:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
um thank you chairman also spoke very
 
02:24:42.889 --> 02:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
clearly on behalf of the Public
 
02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission about the costs
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
that is totally understandable
 
02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:50.990 align:start position:0%
that is totally understandable
um

02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
I guess before I get to the to money I
 
02:24:55.730 --> 02:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
just wanted to to say I wanted to ask
 
02:24:58.250 --> 02:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
this committee to be for thinking for
 
02:25:00.290 --> 02:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire and energy
 
02:25:03.190 --> 02:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
solutions that need to come toward us
 
02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
looking local perhaps preventing
 
02:25:09.530 --> 02:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
too many of these huge transmission
 
02:25:12.050 --> 02:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
lines that out that were threatened by
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
they will change the face of New
 
02:25:15.530 --> 02:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they will change the quality
 
02:25:17.630 --> 02:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
of our life
 
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I think that to work on those you
 
02:25:22.910 --> 02:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
have to be bonded where's our lad from
 
02:25:26.030 --> 02:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
the AFL-CIO gone already I think his
 
02:25:27.770 --> 02:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
local men won't be able to work on some
 
02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
of these projects so there's a little
 
02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:31.730 align:start position:0%
of these projects so there's a little
inconsistency

02:25:31.730 --> 02:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
inconsistency
 
02:25:34.429 --> 02:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
and that brings me to the money money
 
02:25:37.010 --> 02:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
can often be very manipulative and I
 
02:25:38.809 --> 02:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
fear there's a lot of money in this room
 
02:25:41.630 --> 02:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
and I fear we're being manipulated I
 
02:25:43.370 --> 02:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
think if we would follow money it would
 
02:25:46.130 --> 02:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
take us right to the AFL-CIO I don't
 
02:25:47.870 --> 02:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
think he came here on his own I think
 
02:25:51.590 --> 02:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
somebody asked him to speak
 
02:25:53.570 --> 02:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I think that money will flatten
 
02:25:57.010 --> 02:25:57.020 align:start position:0%
historic resources Community Resources
 
02:25:59.230 --> 02:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
environmental resources that are
 
02:26:01.730 --> 02:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
irreplaceable and we really want to be
 
02:26:05.950 --> 02:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
careful about putting money in front of
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
Priceless things that we value here in
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire no doubt the puc would be
 
02:26:13.849 --> 02:26:13.859 align:start position:0%
efficient and I think the people who are
 
02:26:16.309 --> 02:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
opposed will say no doubt it will be
 
02:26:18.290 --> 02:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
predictable if just a handful of people
 
02:26:22.429 --> 02:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
behind closed doors make these decisions
 
02:26:22.439 --> 02:26:23.690 align:start position:0%
behind closed doors make these decisions
so

02:26:23.690 --> 02:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:28.010 --> 02:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:30.469 --> 02:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
why does New Hampshire deserve to have
 
02:26:33.469 --> 02:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
the first Primary in the nation
 
02:26:36.050 --> 02:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
do we deserve to have the first Primary
 
02:26:38.210 --> 02:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
in the nation
 
02:26:41.809 --> 02:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
we listen we talk we talk politics
 
02:26:45.170 --> 02:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
year-round we entertain many sides of
 
02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
each question and we take our voices
 
02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:49.429 align:start position:0%
each question and we take our voices
seriously

02:26:49.429 --> 02:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
02:26:52.130 --> 02:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
this bill ignores the fact that we are
 
02:26:54.889 --> 02:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
deeply interested and indeed the process
 
02:26:57.469 --> 02:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
needs an upgrade
 
02:27:00.349 --> 02:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
please do not depart
 
02:27:04.610 --> 02:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
from the public not just maybe having a
 
02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:05.750 align:start position:0%
from the public not just maybe having a
say

02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:27:09.170 --> 02:27:09.180 align:start position:0%
but have the wider public
 
02:27:14.210 --> 02:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
in a seat at the table for this
 
02:27:16.969 --> 02:27:16.979 align:start position:0%
the precedent is that the voice of the
 
02:27:21.370 --> 02:27:21.380 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire is respected
 
02:27:21.380 --> 02:27:23.030 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire is respected
beneficial

02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
beneficial
 
02:27:27.849 --> 02:27:27.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your perspective
 
02:27:34.190 --> 02:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions from uh this
 
02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative McWilliams as a
 
02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:39.050 align:start position:0%
uh representative McWilliams as a
question

02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and thank
 
02:27:42.770 --> 02:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
you for coming out today in terms of the
 
02:27:44.570 --> 02:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
people having a voice The Proposal right
 
02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
now is the three SEC Commissioners what
 
02:27:48.050 --> 02:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
is your proposal for the public to
 
02:27:49.429 --> 02:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
actually have a voice what would that
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
look like
 
02:27:54.110 --> 02:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
well it certainly wouldn't be too
 
02:27:58.490 --> 02:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
appointed people behind closed doors
 
02:27:59.750 --> 02:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you think there's room for
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
creativity there but
 
02:28:04.370 --> 02:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions we'll next
 
02:28:15.650 --> 02:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning Jeannie Menard
 
02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
from Deerfield if time is being limited
 
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
may I give my one minute to the society
 
02:28:24.889 --> 02:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
for the protection of New Hampshire
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
Force if they are going to be speaking
 
02:28:30.889 --> 02:28:30.899 align:start position:0%
uh okay thank you if you would like to
 
02:28:30.899 --> 02:28:32.270 align:start position:0%
uh okay thank you if you would like to
Yes

02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
Yes
 
02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:32.870 align:start position:0%
Yes
um

02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:36.170 --> 02:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
let's see I do have a card from Matt
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:56.750 --> 02:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:00.410 --> 02:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh good morning thank you Mr chairman
 
02:29:02.270 --> 02:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
um just for the record I'm Matt Leahy
 
02:29:04.730 --> 02:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
I'm the public policy director for the
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
society for the protection of New
 
02:29:09.770 --> 02:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Forest I did hand out our
 
02:29:11.570 --> 02:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
written testimony prior to the hearing
 
02:29:14.510 --> 02:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to reread that I did
 
02:29:16.969 --> 02:29:16.979 align:start position:0%
just want to make one point and I know
 
02:29:20.210 --> 02:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of discussion about
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
um that the current structure of the SEC
 
02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
is a weakness and an issue
 
02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we would respectfully
 
02:29:28.610 --> 02:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
disagree we think it's actually a
 
02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:30.050 align:start position:0%
disagree we think it's actually a
strength

02:29:30.050 --> 02:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
strength
 
02:29:33.290 --> 02:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
um of the current our current citing law
 
02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:34.790 align:start position:0%
um of the current our current citing law
here

02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:29:36.590 --> 02:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
um and having that
 
02:29:39.050 --> 02:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
and certainly the members of the puc who
 
02:29:41.929 --> 02:29:41.939 align:start position:0%
are on the SEC have a certain set of
 
02:29:44.030 --> 02:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
expertise and skills and and that's
 
02:29:46.490 --> 02:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
important to have you know when it comes
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
to time to make a decision on whether or
 
02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
not to approve or not approve an energy
 
02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
project but
 
02:29:56.210 --> 02:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
we also need those additional voices and
 
02:29:59.809 --> 02:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
and and set of expertise that's that is
 
02:30:01.849 --> 02:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
there right now in the current structure
 
02:30:04.429 --> 02:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
of the secs that may and that obviously
 
02:30:06.170 --> 02:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
includes some of the other state
 
02:30:08.510 --> 02:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
agencies but also those public members
 
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
you know they certainly bring their own
 
02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
insight and background that is important
 
02:30:15.050 --> 02:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
to make you know when it when the time
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
comes to make that decision so you know
 
02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
certainly you know we can have an
 
02:30:23.389 --> 02:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
efficient process to make these
 
02:30:27.010 --> 02:30:27.020 align:start position:0%
decisions but you know ultimately
 
02:30:30.650 --> 02:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
the public does need to have faith and
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
trust that whatever the outcome is made
 
02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
in for a particular project you know was
 
02:30:38.570 --> 02:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
reached fairly you know all the
 
02:30:41.570 --> 02:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
information was reviewed and looked at
 
02:30:43.309 --> 02:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
02:30:43.319 --> 02:30:44.090 align:start position:0%
you know the
um

02:30:44.090 --> 02:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:46.250 --> 02:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
you know there was there was you know
 
02:30:48.770 --> 02:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
robust input
 
02:30:50.270 --> 02:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
um in the project from the public right
 
02:30:52.010 --> 02:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
from the get-go
 
02:30:53.330 --> 02:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:30:55.610 --> 02:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
um again we do oppose
 
02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
um the bill and I would just add one
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
thing you know if there is a concern
 
02:31:02.230 --> 02:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
that uh the SEC
 
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
needs more staff needs more resources I
 
02:31:08.570 --> 02:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
mean that is certainly something uh the
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
um the members of the House and Senate
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
can do by you know adding those
 
02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
resources you know if they need
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
additional staff if they need a legal
 
02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
counsel to you know answer any questions
 
02:31:22.010 --> 02:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
relative to the law and the rules
 
02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
um you know you know that is something
 
02:31:25.309 --> 02:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
that I think can be done relatively
 
02:31:28.610 --> 02:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
easily so again we do oppose the bill
 
02:31:30.429 --> 02:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
um but I'm happy to take any questions
 
02:31:32.809 --> 02:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing the forest
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
society's voice to the table
 
02:31:38.090 --> 02:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams has a question
 
02:31:39.410 --> 02:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
same question what would public
 
02:31:41.210 --> 02:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
participation look like for you under
 
02:31:44.090 --> 02:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
this bill I read your testimony are you
 
02:31:45.650 --> 02:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
considering you know there's the
 
02:31:47.809 --> 02:31:47.819 align:start position:0%
attorney piece and then there's actual
 
02:31:49.490 --> 02:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
public members
 
02:31:51.889 --> 02:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
yeah I would again you know we would
 
02:31:53.690 --> 02:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
maintain the current structure which
 
02:31:55.490 --> 02:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
does include those public members you
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
know the role of the um public Office of
 
02:32:01.010 --> 02:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
Public Council needs to be
 
02:32:03.349 --> 02:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
you know happened for every project it
 
02:32:04.670 --> 02:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
should not you know it should be you
 
02:32:07.250 --> 02:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
know it should be a shall appointment we
 
02:32:09.770 --> 02:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
think those are very uh important roles
 
02:32:12.830 --> 02:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
02:32:14.210 --> 02:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no further questions
 
02:32:18.110 --> 02:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
I'll call next on Nancy martland of
 
02:32:31.790 --> 02:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:34.190 --> 02:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm just checking it is
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
still morning isn't it feels like it
 
02:32:37.910 --> 02:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
could be afternoon by now
 
02:32:40.130 --> 02:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
my name is Nancy martland I live in
 
02:32:42.469 --> 02:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
Sugar Hill New Hampshire
 
02:32:46.849 --> 02:32:46.859 align:start position:0%
and I I'm here for the little guy
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
I I feel here in New Hampshire local
 
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
control is something we prize unless it
 
02:32:54.110 --> 02:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
seems we're talking about the sighting
 
02:32:56.809 --> 02:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
of big energy projects the state already
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
preempts the ability of towns to decide
 
02:33:01.330 --> 02:33:01.340 align:start position:0%
where these facilities may be located
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
imposing regulation from Concord
 
02:33:07.910 --> 02:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
this does not go down well in the towns
 
02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
thankfully the present SEC enabling RSA
 
02:33:13.849 --> 02:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
provides for Meaningful local
 
02:33:16.670 --> 02:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
participation in the state adjudicatory
 
02:33:19.250 --> 02:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
process individual landowners towns
 
02:33:21.290 --> 02:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
counties and other entities have the
 
02:33:23.690 --> 02:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
right to participate as interveners with
 
02:33:25.309 --> 02:33:25.319 align:start position:0%
legal standing
 
02:33:28.730 --> 02:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go out on a limb here
 
02:33:31.070 --> 02:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
it would help if I wore my glasses
 
02:33:33.469 --> 02:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of a person who was
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
I thought the SEC project worked just
 
02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:42.530 align:start position:0%
I thought the SEC project worked just
fine

02:33:42.530 --> 02:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
it was long it was arduous
 
02:33:47.450 --> 02:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
but I didn't mind putting in the effort
 
02:33:50.030 --> 02:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
and I was gratified at the thoroughness
 
02:33:52.610 --> 02:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
of the procedure and I feel that the
 
02:33:54.590 --> 02:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
public also
 
02:33:57.550 --> 02:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
could develop trust from the obvious
 
02:34:00.170 --> 02:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
thoroughness of what went on in that in
 
02:34:02.030 --> 02:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
that process
 
02:34:04.250 --> 02:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
the little guys right now are guaranteed
 
02:34:07.010 --> 02:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
a role in a decision-making process that
 
02:34:09.050 --> 02:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
goes beyond a three minute or two minute
 
02:34:11.809 --> 02:34:11.819 align:start position:0%
comment in a hearing somewhere
 
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
they have the right to present testimony
 
02:34:16.910 --> 02:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and be represented by counsel
 
02:34:20.090 --> 02:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
in short it enables affected parties to
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
have an active role in determining their
 
02:34:25.309 --> 02:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
own fate it's the New Hampshire way
 
02:34:27.290 --> 02:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
with respect
 
02:34:30.349 --> 02:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
I am very concerned
 
02:34:33.410 --> 02:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
about the continued robustness of this
 
02:34:35.630 --> 02:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
process and in particular the role of
 
02:34:38.570 --> 02:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
the individual landowner or the town or
 
02:34:39.710 --> 02:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
the county
 
02:34:41.809 --> 02:34:41.819 align:start position:0%
because as someone has previously
 
02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned we all know that the devil is
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the details and we don't know what
 
02:34:48.170 --> 02:34:48.180 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking is going to look like for
 
02:34:50.330 --> 02:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
example who will be allowed to intervene
 
02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
who will make that decision
 
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
what will qualify someone to have that
 
02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
kind of legal standing
 
02:35:01.070 --> 02:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:02.330 align:start position:0%
 
frankly

02:35:02.330 --> 02:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
02:35:03.950 --> 02:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
what I see here
 
02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
and particularly reinforced by what
 
02:35:08.389 --> 02:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
we've witnessed in the last almost two
 
02:35:09.889 --> 02:35:09.899 align:start position:0%
over two hours
 
02:35:13.010 --> 02:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
is Paving the way for energy developers
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
to steamroll over the people of our
 
02:35:16.730 --> 02:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
state with projects that are
 
02:35:18.830 --> 02:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
unacceptable for a wide variety of
 
02:35:21.650 --> 02:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
reasons it seems unfair
 
02:35:23.990 --> 02:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
as citizens of New Hampshire we all
 
02:35:25.790 --> 02:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
deserve the chance to have a hand in our
 
02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
own destiny not be set aside as passive
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
onlookers while matters that affect us
 
02:35:34.929 --> 02:35:34.939 align:start position:0%
are decided by three people in Concord
 
02:35:37.130 --> 02:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
electricity is the lifeblood of our
 
02:35:39.710 --> 02:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
society nobody can deny that we depend
 
02:35:41.870 --> 02:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
on it in our homes our businesses our
 
02:35:44.090 --> 02:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
schools our medical facilities and so
 
02:35:46.910 --> 02:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
much more however while we set about
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
meeting our needs for electricity we
 
02:35:51.170 --> 02:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
should not lose sight of other things
 
02:35:53.870 --> 02:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
that are important finding a balance
 
02:35:55.969 --> 02:35:55.979 align:start position:0%
should be our goal and I believe we can
 
02:35:58.250 --> 02:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
find that balance we should be
 
02:36:00.050 --> 02:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
thoughtful about how we meet our energy
 
02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
needs in the present circumstances it
 
02:36:04.849 --> 02:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
would be easy to permit any project
 
02:36:07.370 --> 02:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
coming down the pike out of a rush to
 
02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
increase Supply we're all feeling that
 
02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:10.250 align:start position:0%
increase Supply we're all feeling that
pressure

02:36:10.250 --> 02:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
02:36:12.170 --> 02:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the energy developers would
 
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
love that but every proposed project
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
must be carefully reviewed not just in
 
02:36:18.830 --> 02:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
terms of the electricity it would Supply
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
but the impacts it would have on our
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
people their lives their livelihoods and
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
their communities the present SEC format
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
provides for a careful review that
 
02:36:31.730 --> 02:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
includes the affected public in a
 
02:36:34.610 --> 02:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
meaningful way and conveys fairness and
 
02:36:37.809 --> 02:36:37.819 align:start position:0%
thoroughness to the General Public
 
02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
hb609 I'm not sure of I don't see it
 
02:36:43.790 --> 02:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
and I someone else mentioned I think
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's worthy of note that Senator Ruth
 
02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
Ward the chair of the study committee
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
does not support this bill please itl it
 
02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:57.530 --> 02:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for driving down from Sugar
 
02:36:59.990 --> 02:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hill please this is a pleasant drive
 
02:37:04.550 --> 02:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
see no questions from the committee I'll
 
02:37:09.469 --> 02:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
call next on The Honorable Suzanne Smith
 
02:37:12.290 --> 02:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
who will give us the AVN perspective on
 
02:37:14.990 --> 02:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
this legis proposed legislation from the
 
02:37:17.870 --> 02:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Audubon Society
 
02:37:21.469 --> 02:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
yes good morning Mr chair and members of
 
02:37:23.889 --> 02:37:23.899 align:start position:0%
the committee nice to see you all again
 
02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Suzanne Smith I live in
 
02:37:29.210 --> 02:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
Hebron and I am here representing New
 
02:37:31.849 --> 02:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Audubon whose testimony was
 
02:37:34.130 --> 02:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
written by Carol Foss who's the senior
 
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
advisor for Science and policy
 
02:37:38.450 --> 02:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank you for the
 
02:37:42.590 --> 02:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide testimony and to
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
let you know New Hampshire Audubon was
 
02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
one of the groups involved in the sb99
 
02:37:52.490 --> 02:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
process which which was an intense study
 
02:37:55.309 --> 02:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
that went on for many months to develop
 
02:37:59.630 --> 02:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
a better SEC back in 2013 to better
 
02:38:01.130 --> 02:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
ensure that the review of energy
 
02:38:03.349 --> 02:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
facility applications serve the public
 
02:38:05.690 --> 02:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
good and provide Clarity to potential
 
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
energy projects and as I say this many
 
02:38:11.929 --> 02:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
people many organizations many of whom
 
02:38:15.290 --> 02:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
are here today sat in on those
 
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
the specific concerns of Audubon
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
regarding hb609 or the loss of diverse
 
02:38:23.630 --> 02:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
perspectives and expertise that the SEC
 
02:38:26.990 --> 02:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
brings to citing considerations the
 
02:38:29.690 --> 02:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
targeted expertise that the puc provides
 
02:38:32.570 --> 02:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
did not does not necessarily address the
 
02:38:34.730 --> 02:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
breadth of considerations required for
 
02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
citing decisions broad expertise at the
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
table during deliberations ensures that
 
02:38:42.429 --> 02:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
all perspectives are fairly
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
represented also the direct involvement
 
02:38:48.349 --> 02:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
as we have heard from other groups of

the environmental impacts of energy

developments are minimized and
 
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
appropriately mitigated and we did hear
 
02:39:15.050 --> 02:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
from AMC about the uh the intervening on
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
behalf of the bicknell's thrush which
 
02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:18.550 align:start position:0%
behalf of the bicknell's thrush which
since

02:39:18.550 --> 02:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
since
 
02:39:21.530 --> 02:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
representative boss said I would speak
 
02:39:24.889 --> 02:39:24.899 align:start position:0%
to the avian concerns loss of public
 
02:39:27.650 --> 02:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
voices from deliberations is also a
 
02:39:30.170 --> 02:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
problem for Audubon citing a major
 
02:39:32.389 --> 02:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
energy facilities can have broad impact
 
02:39:34.750 --> 02:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
on the host and the abutting communities
 
02:39:37.370 --> 02:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
providing for public testimony at
 
02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
hearings and optional appointment of the
 
02:39:41.570 --> 02:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
Council of the public does not
 
02:39:44.090 --> 02:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
adequately replace the presence of
 
02:39:46.969 --> 02:39:46.979 align:start position:0%
public perspectives during deliberations
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
so we strongly recommend a stakeholder
 
02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
analysis of the sec's strengths and
 
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
weaknesses a consensus project that
 
02:39:57.889 --> 02:39:57.899 align:start position:0%
identifies practical improvements to
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
address weaknesses while retaining its
 
02:40:02.450 --> 02:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
strengths and we appreciate your
 
02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
consideration of the testimony and urge
 
02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
you to vote no or inexpedient to
 
02:40:10.910 --> 02:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 609 and thank
 
02:40:14.570 --> 02:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
you and I can take any questions or try
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
to answer them representative Harrington
 
02:40:19.010 --> 02:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you thank you Mr
 
02:40:20.090 --> 02:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:40:21.889 --> 02:40:21.899 align:start position:0%
question boy the Bicknell thrush that
 
02:40:24.110 --> 02:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
brings back the old memories and I was
 
02:40:26.270 --> 02:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
on the site evaluation committee when on
 
02:40:29.330 --> 02:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
that particularly project and I'm trying
 
02:40:30.770 --> 02:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
to think of and maybe you can help me
 
02:40:32.450 --> 02:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
out and point something out in this bill
 
02:40:35.630 --> 02:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
that would eliminate or prevent the I
 
02:40:37.429 --> 02:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
think it was the Audubon Society fishing
 
02:40:39.230 --> 02:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
game in the Appalachian Mountain Club
 
02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
from bringing up the Bicknell thrush
 
02:40:44.570 --> 02:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
issue and there was no particular
 
02:40:47.389 --> 02:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
Bicknell thrust expert on the SEC eat
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
that time yet we managed to put in the
 
02:40:53.030 --> 02:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
the what we were told was we necessary
 
02:40:55.070 --> 02:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh requirements in the permit so that
 
02:40:57.110 --> 02:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
they were protected so where in the bill
 
02:40:58.790 --> 02:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
does this prevent this from happening
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
now by removing the the agencies like
 
02:41:06.770 --> 02:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
fish and game department of natural and
 
02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
cultural resources from the adjudicatory
 
02:41:12.590 --> 02:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
process and leaving it all in the hands
 
02:41:15.530 --> 02:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
of the puc which although they are the
 
02:41:18.889 --> 02:41:18.899 align:start position:0%
best at the energy situation
 
02:41:20.929 --> 02:41:20.939 align:start position:0%
um do not or do not have the expertise
 
02:41:23.570 --> 02:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
to decide on the natural and cultural
 
02:41:28.190 --> 02:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:30.349 --> 02:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
see no further questions I want to thank
 
02:41:32.450 --> 02:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
the honorable Suzanne Smith for being
 
02:41:35.450 --> 02:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
here this morning next we'll
 
02:41:39.050 --> 02:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
ask Mr Fred Ward to step forward and
 
02:41:40.610 --> 02:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
give us his perspective on this
 
02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:46.130 align:start position:0%
give us his perspective on this
legislation

02:41:46.130 --> 02:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:49.130 --> 02:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
I've got a lot of things to say and I
 
02:41:51.349 --> 02:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
think that I would not feel what I'm
 
02:41:54.590 --> 02:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
running against a time thing and you
 
02:41:58.250 --> 02:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
said 11 11 30. and I put 14 years into
 
02:42:00.230 --> 02:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
this so another few days is not going to
 
02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
make that much difference and I really
 
02:42:04.849 --> 02:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
would prefer to have a time when I
 
02:42:06.590 --> 02:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
didn't have a problem
 
02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:08.929 align:start position:0%
didn't have a problem
okay

02:42:08.929 --> 02:42:08.939 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'll put you uh in the list of people
 
02:42:15.050 --> 02:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
who may not get to speak until Monday
 
02:42:17.210 --> 02:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
next I'll call on Mark
 
02:42:20.270 --> 02:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
I think it's McCullough from
 
02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:21.469 align:start position:0%
I think it's McCullough from
um

02:42:21.469 --> 02:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:27.290 --> 02:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:30.050 --> 02:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
you know how this discussion started and
 
02:42:33.889 --> 02:42:33.899 align:start position:0%
everybody was concerned about the cost
 
02:42:37.130 --> 02:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
since I've sat here and listened to this
 
02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:40.910 align:start position:0%
since I've sat here and listened to this
hearing

02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
does anybody realize does anybody agree
 
02:42:47.090 --> 02:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
that CO2 emissions is the number one
 
02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
issue that we have concerning
 
02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
our climate this CO2 emissions from our
 
02:42:57.770 --> 02:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
tailpipes CO2 emissions from all fossil
 
02:43:00.410 --> 02:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
fuels that are also used to produce
 
02:43:02.750 --> 02:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
power which way are you asking the
 
02:43:05.450 --> 02:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
question Dave's Castle positively or
 
02:43:08.570 --> 02:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
negative ice I am against this bill the
 
02:43:09.889 --> 02:43:09.899 align:start position:0%
way it's written I don't know which way
 
02:43:12.650 --> 02:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
are you asking you're asking but I can't
 
02:43:14.809 --> 02:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
tell please uh could you gentlemen take
 
02:43:16.969 --> 02:43:16.979 align:start position:0%
your debate outside if you need to do
 
02:43:19.309 --> 02:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
that uh we're here this morning to
 
02:43:22.190 --> 02:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
gather a testimony with regard to House
 
02:43:25.130 --> 02:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
Bill 609 yes we're not here to discuss
 
02:43:28.610 --> 02:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
whether CO2 is is a big issue in our
 
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
lives or not we want to know whether
 
02:43:35.210 --> 02:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
hb609 is a worthwhile piece of proposed
 
02:43:37.370 --> 02:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
legislation so we'd appreciate your
 
02:43:40.309 --> 02:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
perspective on that but we're not
 
02:43:41.990 --> 02:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
particularly interested in your
 
02:43:43.610 --> 02:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
perspective on climate change there was
 
02:43:45.349 --> 02:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion ahead of time around
 
02:43:48.469 --> 02:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
the cost of Permitting why shouldn't the
 
02:43:52.309 --> 02:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
cost be based on co2 emissions per
 
02:43:52.319 --> 02:43:53.389 align:start position:0%
cost be based on co2 emissions per
megawatt

02:43:53.389 --> 02:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
megawatt
 
02:43:55.610 --> 02:43:55.620 align:start position:0%
start from there and work your way down
 
02:43:55.620 --> 02:43:56.929 align:start position:0%
start from there and work your way down
down

02:43:56.929 --> 02:43:56.939 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:44:00.410 --> 02:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
the cost of renewable good clean energy
 
02:44:04.190 --> 02:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
will be less per CO2 emissions number
 
02:44:06.050 --> 02:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
one that's where that's where this game
 
02:44:08.990 --> 02:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
should start we don't have a lot of time
 
02:44:11.690 --> 02:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
to correct the problem of CO2 emissions
 
02:44:11.700 --> 02:44:18.290 align:start position:0%
to correct the problem of CO2 emissions
now

02:44:18.290 --> 02:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:18.300 --> 02:44:19.790 align:start position:0%

paramedic
 
02:44:22.849 --> 02:44:22.859 align:start position:0%
I've got a little town North Stratford
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
they've got they had to put they've got
 
02:44:28.010 --> 02:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
a a town office on one side of the road
 
02:44:32.570 --> 02:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
they've got a fire department and a
 
02:44:35.030 --> 02:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
a fire department an ambulance and a
 
02:44:36.830 --> 02:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance building right across the
 
02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:38.270 align:start position:0%
maintenance building right across the
road

02:44:38.270 --> 02:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
road
 
02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:40.490 align:start position:0%
road
industry

02:44:40.490 --> 02:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
industry
 
02:44:43.610 --> 02:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
could put that solar anywhere on their
 
02:44:43.620 --> 02:44:45.250 align:start position:0%
could put that solar anywhere on their
locations

02:44:45.250 --> 02:44:45.260 align:start position:0%
locations
 
02:44:49.490 --> 02:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
Our Town had to put their solar on the
 
02:44:52.849 --> 02:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
top of this the roof of the the town
 
02:44:57.290 --> 02:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
hall the town's office versus a much
 
02:45:00.110 --> 02:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
better site just across the road
 
02:45:02.090 --> 02:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
as a municipal
 
02:45:04.670 --> 02:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
group they could not do it but as a
 
02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:05.690 align:start position:0%
group they could not do it but as a
business

02:45:05.690 --> 02:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:45:08.330 --> 02:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
that could have been done one meter
 
02:45:09.950 --> 02:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
would accredit the other through net
 
02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:11.270 align:start position:0%
would accredit the other through net
metering

02:45:11.270 --> 02:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
metering
 
02:45:13.790 --> 02:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
instead the town had to pay more to site
 
02:45:16.730 --> 02:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
to put this Loop put these panels in a
 
02:45:19.130 --> 02:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
place where the
 
02:45:21.889 --> 02:45:21.899 align:start position:0%
the costs were actually higher and and
 
02:45:26.150 --> 02:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
just Why doesn't the puc
 
02:45:28.670 --> 02:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
look at
 
02:45:28.680 --> 02:45:30.590 align:start position:0%
look at
smaller

02:45:30.590 --> 02:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
02:45:34.370 --> 02:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
power solar power production
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't require long transmission
 
02:45:41.809 --> 02:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
you can and they talk about businesses
 
02:45:44.870 --> 02:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
needing needing lower rates why can't
 
02:45:47.330 --> 02:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
they why can't it be simple
 
02:45:49.010 --> 02:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
to install
 
02:45:49.020 --> 02:45:50.929 align:start position:0%
to install
solar

02:45:50.929 --> 02:45:50.939 align:start position:0%

02:45:53.210 --> 02:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
you're pretty concerned about that clock
 
02:45:54.590 --> 02:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
aren't you
 
02:45:56.330 --> 02:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
well this is real
 
02:46:00.110 --> 02:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
I'm one of these guys that had I saw I
 
02:46:02.030 --> 02:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
saw the new
 
02:46:05.210 --> 02:46:05.220 align:start position:0%
Northern Pass come through my property I
 
02:46:08.809 --> 02:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
saw that about to happen 10 years
 
02:46:12.349 --> 02:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
I swatched this process the damn
 
02:46:15.770 --> 02:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
Northern the hydro Quebec and the whole
 
02:46:18.050 --> 02:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
process they're the ones that held that
 
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
process up they're the ones that that
 
02:46:22.250 --> 02:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
weren't completing their permitting
 
02:46:25.250 --> 02:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
properly we were the ones that were
 
02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
forcing them to fill out the permit in a
 
02:46:29.510 --> 02:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time it didn't
 
02:46:31.550 --> 02:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
happen I don't think the thing was done
 
02:46:35.090 --> 02:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
before they completed the project
 
02:46:37.910 --> 02:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
with without this the changes that were
 
02:46:40.550 --> 02:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
made by in the site of iron commission
 
02:46:43.309 --> 02:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
site of value evaluation committee and
 
02:46:45.650 --> 02:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
their their rules that happened during
 
02:46:47.690 --> 02:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
the northern process Northern Pass
 
02:46:47.700 --> 02:46:49.010 align:start position:0%
the northern process Northern Pass
project

02:46:49.010 --> 02:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:46:51.349 --> 02:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
we had to run around with freaking
 
02:46:55.610 --> 02:46:55.620 align:start position:0%
stupid orange hats and stand up as a
 
02:46:58.670 --> 02:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
group and fight this fight exactly what
 
02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
this this committee and what you're
 
02:47:08.389 --> 02:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
trying to do is a disgrace
 
02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
I am ashamed
 
02:47:12.950 --> 02:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
of what I have been hearing
 
02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank goodness we got the society for
 
02:47:17.690 --> 02:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
the protection of New Hampshire Force
 
02:47:20.450 --> 02:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
without them this would have got Rim rug
 
02:47:23.690 --> 02:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
REM rotted right down our throats
 
02:47:25.730 --> 02:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I took so much of your
 
02:47:25.740 --> 02:47:26.870 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I took so much of your
precious

02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
precious
 
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate you being here
 
02:47:33.830 --> 02:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
so next we'll call on Kristen Koch of
 
02:47:40.929 --> 02:47:40.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:43.370 --> 02:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
you're right I'm sorry
 
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
my mistake
 
02:47:48.290 --> 02:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
next we'll call on Catherine corkery of
 
02:48:08.450 --> 02:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:08.460 --> 02:48:11.650 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:48:11.650 --> 02:48:11.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:13.730 --> 02:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
to take a few minutes my name is
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
Catherine corkery I'm from New Hampshire
 
02:48:19.490 --> 02:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
Sierra Club and I appreciate
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
um being able to speak today
 
02:48:26.990 --> 02:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
um Sierra Club opposes this bill
 
02:48:28.969 --> 02:48:28.979 align:start position:0%
um for
 
02:48:33.370 --> 02:48:33.380 align:start position:0%
three reasons one that has already been
 
02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
highlighted was replacing the rules that
 
02:48:40.490 --> 02:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
currently exist
 
02:48:43.250 --> 02:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
for the site evaluation committee it's
 
02:48:46.910 --> 02:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
in the rules where all the meaty juicy
 
02:48:49.730 --> 02:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
stuff is and
 
02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
um eliminating those
 
02:48:56.690 --> 02:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
really takes away from this process
 
02:48:59.389 --> 02:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
um that has
 
02:49:01.730 --> 02:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
been very effective
 
02:49:03.730 --> 02:49:03.740 align:start position:0%
the lengthy
 
02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
in in
 
02:49:08.590 --> 02:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
reviewing these
 
02:49:11.090 --> 02:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
these really big projects
 
02:49:14.450 --> 02:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
the other benefit of the site evaluation
 
02:49:19.429 --> 02:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
committee is that it brings the project
 
02:49:21.830 --> 02:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
into Focus
 
02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
from all of the other agencies
 
02:49:28.690 --> 02:49:28.700 align:start position:0%
you you get to really
 
02:49:33.290 --> 02:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
get into the those juicy chunky parts of
 
02:49:37.690 --> 02:49:37.700 align:start position:0%
a project and look at the the the
 
02:49:40.670 --> 02:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
birds that are going to be affected the
 
02:49:42.830 --> 02:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
wetlands that are going to be affected
 
02:49:46.309 --> 02:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
and that is lost
 
02:49:50.090 --> 02:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
by this bill it's lost they may not be
 
02:49:51.650 --> 02:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
02:49:55.610 --> 02:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
but you're eliminating the rules
 
02:49:58.610 --> 02:49:58.620 align:start position:0%
and I know uh representative Thomas had
 
02:50:01.250 --> 02:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
a question about that
 
02:50:05.330 --> 02:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
um so it's the rules that
 
02:50:08.450 --> 02:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
really provide that guidance
 
02:50:12.370 --> 02:50:12.380 align:start position:0%
and thirdly something that hasn't been
 
02:50:15.469 --> 02:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
discussed is that
 
02:50:19.309 --> 02:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
this bill as introduced puts into the
 
02:50:19.319 --> 02:50:21.590 align:start position:0%
this bill as introduced puts into the
hands

02:50:21.590 --> 02:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
hands
 
02:50:24.770 --> 02:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
not of the puc
 
02:50:28.910 --> 02:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
to the responsibility of keeping our
 
02:50:32.090 --> 02:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
rates low which in my opinion they are
 
02:50:32.100 --> 02:50:33.490 align:start position:0%
rates low which in my opinion they are
not

02:50:33.490 --> 02:50:33.500 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:50:36.650 --> 02:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
and to approve new facilities
 
02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
how can they hold those two things at
 
02:50:40.849 --> 02:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
I think it's a conflict of interest
 
02:50:47.030 --> 02:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
and I did see in the original bill it's
 
02:50:49.370 --> 02:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
not addressed at all
 
02:50:52.910 --> 02:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh and and I a quick review of the
 
02:50:55.550 --> 02:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that was given though not
 
02:50:55.560 --> 02:50:56.870 align:start position:0%
amendment that was given though not
introduced

02:50:56.870 --> 02:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
02:50:59.570 --> 02:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
in the committee
 
02:51:04.910 --> 02:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
I on page nine line 11 it starts
 
02:51:09.230 --> 02:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
it does talk about how
 
02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:11.530 align:start position:0%
it does talk about how
um

02:51:11.530 --> 02:51:11.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:15.410 --> 02:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
utility rates charges and tariffs will
 
02:51:18.110 --> 02:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
be considered I do not have confidence
 
02:51:21.290 --> 02:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
that this puc oh oh I'm sorry page nine
 
02:51:24.050 --> 02:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
02:51:24.060 --> 02:51:25.849 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
sorry

02:51:25.849 --> 02:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:51:25.859 --> 02:51:26.870 align:start position:0%
sorry
um

02:51:26.870 --> 02:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:31.910 --> 02:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
page nine of the amendment on line 11.
 
02:51:34.490 --> 02:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
um it does consider
 
02:51:34.500 --> 02:51:36.230 align:start position:0%
um it does consider
rate

02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
rate
 
02:51:39.410 --> 02:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe the commission can
 
02:51:41.510 --> 02:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
do those two things at once they're
 
02:51:43.849 --> 02:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of other things I'm not
 
02:51:47.270 --> 02:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
saying that they can't do other things
 
02:51:50.929 --> 02:51:50.939 align:start position:0%
but doing these two things
 
02:51:53.090 --> 02:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
I I don't think
 
02:51:54.650 --> 02:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
um I think that is a conflict of
 
02:51:58.010 --> 02:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
interest and I that is my comment thank
 
02:51:58.020 --> 02:51:59.269 align:start position:0%
interest and I that is my comment thank
you

02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:52:00.889 --> 02:52:00.899 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate your being here
 
02:52:02.870 --> 02:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question for
 
02:52:04.910 --> 02:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman if you have
 
02:52:09.769 --> 02:52:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:11.809 --> 02:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
you do so so I'd like you to elaborate
 
02:52:13.910 --> 02:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
please a little bit more on how is it
 
02:52:16.429 --> 02:52:16.439 align:start position:0%
that it's a conflict of interest for the
 
02:52:19.250 --> 02:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
puc to decide on citing and keep rates
 
02:52:21.050 --> 02:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
down what what what's inherent in there
 
02:52:23.809 --> 02:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
that makes that a conflict of interest
 
02:52:31.250 --> 02:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:31.260 --> 02:52:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
undoubtedly

02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly
 
02:52:38.750 --> 02:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
the cost of a facility will be passed on
 
02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
and to Consumers to the ratepayers
 
02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:45.349 align:start position:0%
and to Consumers to the ratepayers
if

02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:52:49.429 --> 02:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
they then say having that in mind say oh
 
02:52:49.439 --> 02:52:50.450 align:start position:0%
they then say having that in mind say oh
well

02:52:50.450 --> 02:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:52:53.030 --> 02:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
this project
 
02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:53.809 align:start position:0%
this project
um

02:52:53.809 --> 02:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:56.990 --> 02:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's gonna affect Wetlands if we do it
 
02:52:58.910 --> 02:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
this way
 
02:53:02.870 --> 02:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
or if we have a study about the Beth
 
02:53:06.710 --> 02:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
Nails thresh let's not have the study
 
02:53:10.130 --> 02:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
let's not have the the sound tests let's
 
02:53:11.929 --> 02:53:11.939 align:start position:0%
not do
 
02:53:16.370 --> 02:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
all of these things that will cost money
 
02:53:19.969 --> 02:53:19.979 align:start position:0%
because we have to keep rates low
 
02:53:26.469 --> 02:53:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:39.110 --> 02:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:41.450 --> 02:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much seeing no
 
02:53:42.769 --> 02:53:42.779 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:53:45.170 --> 02:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
well next call on Nick Paul of the of

uh clean energy New Hampshire is not
 
02:54:05.690 --> 02:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
going to take a position on the bill
 
02:54:05.700 --> 02:54:06.590 align:start position:0%
going to take a position on the bill
today

02:54:06.590 --> 02:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:54:08.389 --> 02:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
um Nick where
 
02:54:10.610 --> 02:54:10.620 align:start position:0%
we're looking forward to reviewing the
 
02:54:13.550 --> 02:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
amendment we want to remain a
 
02:54:15.889 --> 02:54:15.899 align:start position:0%
constructive partner and resource to the
 
02:54:15.899 --> 02:54:16.790 align:start position:0%
constructive partner and resource to the
committee

02:54:16.790 --> 02:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:54:20.450 --> 02:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh as as we seek to improve our citing
 
02:54:20.460 --> 02:54:21.590 align:start position:0%
uh as as we seek to improve our citing
process

02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:54:23.210 --> 02:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee was
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
established in recognition of the fact
 
02:54:26.690 --> 02:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
that energy projects have statewide
 
02:54:28.250 --> 02:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
impacts and should therefore be
 
02:54:30.349 --> 02:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
evaluated by a Statewide body
 
02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
the first project it permitted was a 112
 
02:54:34.969 --> 02:54:34.979 align:start position:0%
mile long 1800 megawatt transmission
 
02:54:37.070 --> 02:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
line that connects connects New England
 
02:54:39.530 --> 02:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
to hydro Quebec and continues in
 
02:54:40.790 --> 02:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
operation today
 
02:54:42.650 --> 02:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
however the energy landscape has
 
02:54:44.330 --> 02:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
transformed dramatically since this
 
02:54:46.370 --> 02:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
first project was completed today
 
02:54:48.469 --> 02:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
smaller more broadly distributed
 
02:54:50.750 --> 02:54:50.760 align:start position:0%

electricity
 
02:54:56.090 --> 02:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
and soaring electricity rates are
 
02:54:57.950 --> 02:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
increasing pressure within the New
 
02:54:59.870 --> 02:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
England region to develop new affordable
 
02:55:02.929 --> 02:55:02.939 align:start position:0%
sources of energy Supply furthermore the
 
02:55:05.150 --> 02:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
building and transportation sectors are
 
02:55:07.010 --> 02:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
beginning to rapidly Electrify across
 
02:55:09.230 --> 02:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
the United States which is projected to
 
02:55:12.469 --> 02:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
double electricity consumption now more
 
02:55:14.030 --> 02:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
than ever New Hampshire needs an
 
02:55:16.730 --> 02:55:16.740 align:start position:0%

accomplish this a Statewide citing body
 
02:55:46.790 --> 02:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
should be staffed so that it builds

regarding the sighting of energy
 
02:55:52.610 --> 02:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
infrastructure this should include
 
02:55:55.610 --> 02:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
dedicated professional hearings officers
 
02:55:57.290 --> 02:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
who can work to Usher projects through
 
02:55:59.450 --> 02:55:59.460 align:start position:0%

adhered to the New Hampshire Public
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission is already short on
 
02:56:06.410 --> 02:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
staff following the 2021 creation of the
 
02:56:08.269 --> 02:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and is not equipped
 
02:56:09.889 --> 02:56:09.899 align:start position:0%
to handle a large influx of energy
 
02:56:12.230 --> 02:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
projects this will be increasingly
 
02:56:14.330 --> 02:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
important as the energy transition
 
02:56:14.340 --> 02:56:15.769 align:start position:0%

accelerates

02:56:15.769 --> 02:56:15.779 align:start position:0%
accelerates
 
02:56:18.290 --> 02:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
which will result in more projects and
 
02:56:21.230 --> 02:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
smaller projects being proposed
 
02:56:23.570 --> 02:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
second the legislature should consider
 
02:56:25.730 --> 02:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
increasing the size of the projects that
 
02:56:27.889 --> 02:56:27.899 align:start position:0%
trigger a Statewide review energy
 
02:56:29.750 --> 02:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
developers now work very hard at
 
02:56:31.429 --> 02:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
partnering with towns and cities to find
 
02:56:33.170 --> 02:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
proposals that can win widespread
 
02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
Community buy-in as such a modest
 
02:56:38.150 --> 02:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
increase of the threshold that triggers
 
02:56:40.849 --> 02:56:40.859 align:start position:0%
Statewide review from 30 megawatts up to
 
02:56:43.370 --> 02:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
50 megawatts may be a reasonable method
 
02:56:45.349 --> 02:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
of easing The Strain on a Statewide
 
02:56:48.110 --> 02:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
citing process however
 
02:56:50.090 --> 02:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
such an increase should be accompanied
 
02:56:52.250 --> 02:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
by a requirement that developers provide
 
02:56:54.469 --> 02:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
funding for local officials to retain
 
02:56:56.750 --> 02:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
expert Consultants to advise them on
 
02:56:58.429 --> 02:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
Project impacts
 
02:57:00.830 --> 02:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
a third any changes to the citing
 
02:57:03.110 --> 02:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
process should continue to ensure that
 
02:57:04.550 --> 02:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
its decisions are made in the public
 
02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:05.630 align:start position:0%
its decisions are made in the public
interest

02:57:05.630 --> 02:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
interest
 
02:57:07.490 --> 02:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
to accomplish this we should ensure that
 
02:57:09.590 --> 02:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
public participation is enabled through
 
02:57:12.349 --> 02:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
a transparent and open process the
 
02:57:14.150 --> 02:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
existing decision criteria should be
 
02:57:16.490 --> 02:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
retained and the role of the council for
 
02:57:19.190 --> 02:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
the public should be bolstered finally
 
02:57:21.889 --> 02:57:21.899 align:start position:0%
approved projects must be made in the
 
02:57:23.450 --> 02:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
best interest of short and long-term
 
02:57:25.190 --> 02:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
public health and Environmental Quality
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
while there will be unavoidable impacts
 
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
due to land use change and Landscape
 
02:57:32.450 --> 02:57:32.460 align:start position:0%
modification the SEC should prioritize
 
02:57:34.490 --> 02:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
preserving and improving New Hampshire's
 
02:57:36.889 --> 02:57:36.899 align:start position:0%
air and water quality and the health of
 
02:57:39.530 --> 02:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
the state's natural ecosystems these are
 
02:57:40.969 --> 02:57:40.979 align:start position:0%
directly tied to the health of New
 
02:57:43.010 --> 02:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents as well as to the
 
02:57:45.530 --> 02:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
strength of our economy which depends on
 
02:57:48.110 --> 02:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
States our state's natural resources in
 
02:57:50.269 --> 02:57:50.279 align:start position:0%
no small measure we welcome the
 
02:57:51.769 --> 02:57:51.779 align:start position:0%
opportunity to consult with committee
 
02:57:54.650 --> 02:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
members regarding how these elements can
 
02:57:56.950 --> 02:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
be designed into the citing process
 
02:57:59.929 --> 02:57:59.939 align:start position:0%
and most of you already have mine and
 
02:58:01.490 --> 02:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
Sam's contact information but if you
 
02:58:04.070 --> 02:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
don't it's in here so I'd be happy to
 
02:58:05.330 --> 02:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions that you
 
02:58:05.340 --> 02:58:06.889 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions that you
have

02:58:06.889 --> 02:58:06.899 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:58:06.899 --> 02:58:08.809 align:start position:0%
have
um

02:58:08.809 --> 02:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:10.670 --> 02:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
02:58:12.469 --> 02:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:58:14.090 --> 02:58:14.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm going to ask you
 
02:58:15.290 --> 02:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
a question that I asked a previous
 
02:58:15.300 --> 02:58:16.969 align:start position:0%
a question that I asked a previous
Witness

02:58:16.969 --> 02:58:16.979 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
02:58:19.910 --> 02:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the the idea that the
 
02:58:22.910 --> 02:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
decision making would be put into the
 
02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:24.349 align:start position:0%
decision making would be put into the
puc

02:58:24.349 --> 02:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
puc
 
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
and understanding that you believe that
 
02:58:29.090 --> 02:58:29.100 align:start position:0%
they need additional support but just
 
02:58:31.910 --> 02:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
should the POC alone be the deciding
 
02:58:31.920 --> 02:58:34.250 align:start position:0%
should the POC alone be the deciding
body

02:58:34.250 --> 02:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:36.250 --> 02:58:36.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I'd be comfortable
 
02:58:39.710 --> 02:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
speaking directly to that but we can
 
02:58:41.210 --> 02:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
have further discussions with our policy
 
02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:57.170 --> 02:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:59.750 --> 02:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative Winnie Thomas thank
 
02:59:01.250 --> 02:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
you um
 
02:59:03.710 --> 02:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
I I'm just um interested I actually had
 
02:59:05.150 --> 02:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
a question about whether or not you
 
02:59:06.469 --> 02:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
considered the environment and that was
 
02:59:08.750 --> 02:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
your final point just a question about
 
02:59:11.269 --> 02:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
clean energy in general do you have an
 
02:59:15.230 --> 02:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
environmental arm that looks at at the
 
02:59:17.150 --> 02:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
environment for all policies or is it
 
02:59:19.429 --> 02:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
just the specific one
 
02:59:22.010 --> 02:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry are you asking if clean
 
02:59:23.450 --> 02:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire has an arm that
 
02:59:25.490 --> 02:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
does that or if you're asking about no
 
02:59:27.230 --> 02:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
I'm asking if clean energy New Hampshire
 
02:59:29.630 --> 02:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
looks at the environmental impact for
 
02:59:31.550 --> 02:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
for all of your policies or is it just
 
02:59:33.530 --> 02:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
for this one bill that you're it's
 
02:59:34.969 --> 02:59:34.979 align:start position:0%
certainly something we consider on a
 
02:59:52.250 --> 02:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:54.290 --> 02:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
all right apologies any other questions
 
02:59:55.320 --> 02:59:55.330 align:start position:0%
from anybody
 
02:59:55.330 --> 02:59:56.950 align:start position:0%
from anybody
[Music]

02:59:56.950 --> 02:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:59:59.090 --> 02:59:59.100 align:start position:0%
that being said thank you very much
 
03:00:04.910 --> 03:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:07.730 --> 03:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
go into a recess
 
03:00:09.950 --> 03:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
until Monday morning
 
03:00:13.190 --> 03:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
this room is needed this afternoon and
 
03:00:15.530 --> 03:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
some of us have other commitments to do
 
03:00:17.750 --> 03:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
so we know the people are coming back
 
03:00:20.210 --> 03:00:20.220 align:start position:0%
here on Monday and this committee will
 
03:00:22.490 --> 03:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
also will be do be doing an execution as
 
03:00:26.690 --> 03:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:33.769 --> 03:00:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:33.779 --> 03:00:35.349 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:00:35.349 --> 03:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:00:37.969 --> 03:00:37.979 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair there's a question about the
 
03:00:39.530 --> 03:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
order of the people that will be allowed
 
03:00:41.630 --> 03:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
to speak on Monday
 
03:00:43.309 --> 03:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
well I can only assume it's the people
 
03:00:45.710 --> 03:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
that are left in in the stack here uh
 
03:00:47.450 --> 03:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
that question will have to be asked to
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:55.680 --> 03:00:57.050 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:00:57.050 --> 03:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:00:57.060 --> 03:00:58.269 align:start position:0%
sure
yeah

03:00:58.269 --> 03:00:58.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:01:01.250 --> 03:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
but but bear in mind we have a lot of
 
03:01:03.469 --> 03:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
bills to exec on Monday so we will have
 
03:01:06.110 --> 03:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
some hard stop times as well so we will
 
03:01:07.610 --> 03:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
allow plenty of time for the people that
 
03:01:09.050 --> 03:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
signed up here
 
03:01:20.570 --> 03:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:25.929 --> 03:01:25.939 align:start position:0%
I will open the session for HB 142 and
 
03:01:28.849 --> 03:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
present chairman Vose as a sponsor of
 
03:01:31.070 --> 03:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:01:32.870 --> 03:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair and good morning
 
03:01:32.880 --> 03:01:34.070 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair and good morning
or

03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:01:37.010 --> 03:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
good afternoon as the case might be
 
03:01:39.710 --> 03:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
to the fellow members of the committee
 
03:01:41.090 --> 03:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
for the record once again I'm
 
03:01:43.250 --> 03:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Bose
 
03:01:46.370 --> 03:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham District 5 the
 
03:01:49.070 --> 03:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
town of Epping and I'm serving as chair
 
03:01:51.230 --> 03:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
of this committee today I'm introducing
 
03:02:01.969 --> 03:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:04.130 --> 03:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
please leave this room quietly we have
 
03:02:05.809 --> 03:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
another testimony going on the member
 
03:02:11.330 --> 03:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:15.410 --> 03:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
member shall proceed
 
03:02:19.550 --> 03:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
we're here this uh this afternoon to
 
03:02:23.570 --> 03:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
here House Bill 142 the introduction of
 
03:02:26.870 --> 03:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:29.630 --> 03:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
those of you who were here last April
 
03:02:32.110 --> 03:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
will recall that
 
03:02:36.650 --> 03:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
with the passage of Senate Bill 271 by
 
03:02:38.330 --> 03:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
03:02:42.710 --> 03:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:45.230 --> 03:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
spend as much time as it took
 
03:02:47.090 --> 03:02:47.100 align:start position:0%
to determine if there was any
 
03:02:47.100 --> 03:02:48.830 align:start position:0%
to determine if there was any
significant

03:02:48.830 --> 03:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:50.510 align:start position:0%
significant
solution

03:02:50.510 --> 03:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
solution
 
03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
to the problem of
 
03:02:56.330 --> 03:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
biomass generated electricity and its
 
03:02:56.340 --> 03:02:57.290 align:start position:0%
biomass generated electricity and its
cost

03:02:57.290 --> 03:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
cost
 
03:03:02.210 --> 03:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:04.670 --> 03:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
I knew that a lot of other very
 
03:03:07.070 --> 03:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable people had looked into
 
03:03:10.490 --> 03:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
this question for many many years
 
03:03:13.250 --> 03:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
but I needed to prove to myself that we
 
03:03:13.260 --> 03:03:15.230 align:start position:0%
but I needed to prove to myself that we
hadn't

03:03:15.230 --> 03:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
hadn't
 
03:03:17.570 --> 03:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
accidentally overlooked
 
03:03:21.170 --> 03:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
some potential solution to the high cost
 
03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
of biomass generated electricity I
 
03:03:25.309 --> 03:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we turned over
 
03:03:27.769 --> 03:03:27.779 align:start position:0%
every Rock
 
03:03:31.309 --> 03:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
and could be therefore certain
 
03:03:35.809 --> 03:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:38.389 --> 03:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
to deal with the problem of biomass
 
03:03:38.399 --> 03:03:40.730 align:start position:0%
to deal with the problem of biomass
electricity

03:03:40.730 --> 03:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
03:03:42.710 --> 03:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
and it's high cost
 
03:03:45.590 --> 03:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
so I spent the last nine months doing
 
03:03:48.290 --> 03:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
just exactly that I held over a hundred
 
03:03:51.050 --> 03:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
over a dozen meetings with various
 
03:03:51.060 --> 03:03:55.010 align:start position:0%
over a dozen meetings with various
stakeholders

03:03:55.010 --> 03:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:57.889 --> 03:03:57.899 align:start position:0%
formal meetings and then dozens more
 
03:04:00.469 --> 03:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
informal meetings and discussions with
 
03:04:02.330 --> 03:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
various people
 
03:04:04.130 --> 03:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
about whether or not there was anything
 
03:04:09.230 --> 03:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:11.510 --> 03:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
and those discussions led me to the
 
03:04:13.969 --> 03:04:13.979 align:start position:0%
conclusion that there is no Silver
 
03:04:13.979 --> 03:04:15.590 align:start position:0%
conclusion that there is no Silver
Bullet

03:04:15.590 --> 03:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
Bullet
 
03:04:20.210 --> 03:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:24.349 --> 03:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:27.349 --> 03:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
renewable energy was determined to be a
 
03:04:29.030 --> 03:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
very desirable
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
direction in which to move our energy
 
03:04:35.210 --> 03:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
generation Supply
 
03:04:37.550 --> 03:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
with the passage of purpa
 
03:04:40.309 --> 03:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
we determined that generating
 
03:04:43.370 --> 03:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
electricity from burning wood
 
03:04:45.410 --> 03:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
was a renewable source that was worth
 
03:04:45.420 --> 03:04:48.230 align:start position:0%
was a renewable source that was worth
pursuing

03:04:48.230 --> 03:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:48.240 --> 03:04:50.809 align:start position:0%
 
purpa

03:04:50.809 --> 03:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
purpa
 
03:04:54.110 --> 03:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
enabled very generous subsidies for
 
03:04:57.410 --> 03:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
biomass electricity production
 
03:05:02.809 --> 03:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:04.790 --> 03:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
but the subsidies
 
03:05:08.030 --> 03:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
were necessary to continue in order for
 
03:05:10.910 --> 03:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
it to continue to operate
 
03:05:15.230 --> 03:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
and the subsidies became untenable
 
03:05:16.849 --> 03:05:16.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire ratepayers paid over two
 
03:05:20.150 --> 03:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
billion dollars over the course of a 20
 
03:05:22.429 --> 03:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
25 30-year period
 
03:05:22.439 --> 03:05:24.550 align:start position:0%
25 30-year period
for

03:05:24.550 --> 03:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:05:29.510 --> 03:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:33.710 --> 03:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:36.170 --> 03:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
we've proved that biomass electricity
 
03:05:38.210 --> 03:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
generated electricity is just not
 
03:05:38.220 --> 03:05:41.389 align:start position:0%
generated electricity is just not
efficient

03:05:41.389 --> 03:05:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:43.309 --> 03:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
so today we Face the question of what to
 
03:05:46.010 --> 03:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:48.050 --> 03:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
one of the two remaining biomass
 
03:05:50.150 --> 03:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
electricity generating plants here in
 
03:05:51.349 --> 03:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and that's Burgess
 
03:05:55.730 --> 03:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:58.490 --> 03:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
back in 2010 Burgess signed a purchase
 
03:06:03.230 --> 03:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:08.170 --> 03:06:08.180 align:start position:0%
at the urging of members of
 
03:06:12.830 --> 03:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
the administration that was in office at
 
03:06:15.530 --> 03:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:18.170 --> 03:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
because the city of Berlin and koas
 
03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
county in general were suffering
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
suffering economically from the loss of
 
03:06:24.290 --> 03:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
a major paper mill
 
03:06:26.090 --> 03:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
which devastated
 
03:06:30.410 --> 03:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:32.510 --> 03:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
so negotiations began between a company
 
03:06:36.530 --> 03:06:36.540 align:start position:0%
called laid law and eversource to build
 
03:06:39.530 --> 03:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
on the site of the Old Paper Mill a
 
03:06:44.929 --> 03:06:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:47.809 --> 03:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
and the result of those negotiations was
 
03:06:50.330 --> 03:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
a purchase power agreement a PPA
 
03:06:50.340 --> 03:06:53.450 align:start position:0%
a purchase power agreement a PPA
so-called

03:06:53.450 --> 03:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:55.389 --> 03:06:55.399 align:start position:0%
that allowed
 
03:07:00.050 --> 03:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
the facility to be built
 
03:07:02.750 --> 03:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
that purchase power agreement was to
 
03:07:06.290 --> 03:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
last for 20 years and was to provide
 
03:07:08.570 --> 03:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
funding for Burgess to continue
 
03:07:08.580 --> 03:07:13.550 align:start position:0%
funding for Burgess to continue
operation

03:07:13.550 --> 03:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:15.650 --> 03:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire state law requires that
 
03:07:17.210 --> 03:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
purchase power agreements have to be
 
03:07:18.710 --> 03:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
approved by the Public Utilities
 
03:07:20.570 --> 03:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
Commission so when the commission
 
03:07:20.580 --> 03:07:23.510 align:start position:0%
Commission so when the commission
investigated

03:07:23.510 --> 03:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
investigated
 
03:07:25.370 --> 03:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
the purchase power agreement that was
 
03:07:29.450 --> 03:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
negotiated between Laidlaw and PSNH or
 
03:07:33.230 --> 03:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:39.050 --> 03:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:41.929 --> 03:07:41.939 align:start position:0%
the PPA offered
 
03:07:45.010 --> 03:07:45.020 align:start position:0%
a fixed price for Energy but it also
 
03:07:47.330 --> 03:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
included the purchase of renewable
 
03:07:51.170 --> 03:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
energy certificates from Burgess
 
03:07:52.730 --> 03:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
or laid law
 
03:07:54.830 --> 03:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
by PSNH
 
03:07:57.170 --> 03:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
and that the purchase price of those
 
03:07:58.849 --> 03:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits was
 
03:08:02.330 --> 03:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
considerably higher than what the RPS
 
03:08:05.889 --> 03:08:05.899 align:start position:0%
Market would price those credits
 
03:08:08.330 --> 03:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
certificates at
 
03:08:12.170 --> 03:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
some 70 percent of the ACP price was
 
03:08:13.610 --> 03:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
what was
 
03:08:17.570 --> 03:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:19.490 --> 03:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
so the Public Utilities Commission at
 
03:08:21.490 --> 03:08:21.500 align:start position:0%
the time
 
03:08:25.490 --> 03:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
determined that the PPA was just not
 
03:08:28.130 --> 03:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
economic for the state
 
03:08:31.550 --> 03:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
and so it imposed a condition on Burgess
 
03:08:31.560 --> 03:08:32.889 align:start position:0%
and so it imposed a condition on Burgess
and

03:08:32.889 --> 03:08:32.899 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:08:35.929 --> 03:08:35.939 align:start position:0%
pcnsa PSNH
 
03:08:39.230 --> 03:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
that in order to approve the PPA
 
03:08:42.349 --> 03:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
there would have to be a cap on
 
03:08:46.130 --> 03:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
over-market energy costs associated with
 
03:08:48.110 --> 03:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
the operation of the plant so they
 
03:08:48.120 --> 03:08:49.790 align:start position:0%
the operation of the plant so they
determined

03:08:49.790 --> 03:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
determined
 
03:08:52.910 --> 03:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
that a 100 million dollar cap
 
03:08:56.269 --> 03:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
on EX over-market energy costs would be
 
03:08:59.090 --> 03:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
an appropriate way to make the PPA
 
03:08:59.100 --> 03:09:02.269 align:start position:0%
an appropriate way to make the PPA
approvable

03:09:02.269 --> 03:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
that was the condition under which they
 
03:09:07.969 --> 03:09:07.979 align:start position:0%
approved it and the PPA was altered
 
03:09:10.610 --> 03:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
subsequently by the parties to conform
 
03:09:14.990 --> 03:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:17.450 --> 03:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
so the plant began operating and
 
03:09:20.510 --> 03:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
over-market costs began accumulating
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
and in 2017
 
03:09:25.309 --> 03:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
the plant realized that they were going
 
03:09:28.910 --> 03:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
to soon hit the 100 million dollar cap
 
03:09:32.450 --> 03:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
the PPA provided that once that cap was
 
03:09:32.460 --> 03:09:34.070 align:start position:0%
the PPA provided that once that cap was
achieved

03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
achieved
 
03:09:36.410 --> 03:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
then the plant would have to start
 
03:09:40.429 --> 03:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
paying back any excess over that 100
 
03:09:42.950 --> 03:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:09:46.070 --> 03:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
in a 12-month period following the
 
03:09:51.110 --> 03:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
the folks at Burgess realized they
 
03:09:54.590 --> 03:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
weren't going to be able to handle that
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
financially so they came to the
 
03:10:00.590 --> 03:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
legislature and asked for
 
03:10:04.790 --> 03:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:07.250 --> 03:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
passed Senate bill 577.
 
03:10:14.330 --> 03:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
which was amended in this committee
 
03:10:16.969 --> 03:10:16.979 align:start position:0%
by our current Vice chair representative
 
03:10:19.130 --> 03:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
Douglas Thomas
 
03:10:23.809 --> 03:10:23.819 align:start position:0%
to provide a three-year Hiatus from the
 
03:10:27.410 --> 03:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
paying back of the over 100 million
 
03:10:30.469 --> 03:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
dollar excess in over-market energy
 
03:10:37.490 --> 03:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:40.670 --> 03:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
as that three-year period
 
03:10:42.769 --> 03:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
was set to expire
 
03:10:46.969 --> 03:10:46.979 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill SB 271 which we heard last
 
03:10:46.979 --> 03:10:48.710 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill SB 271 which we heard last
year

03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:10:51.469 --> 03:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
tried to address this problem
 
03:10:54.050 --> 03:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
and this committee
 
03:10:57.469 --> 03:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
amended that bill to extend
 
03:11:01.849 --> 03:11:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
now that moratorium is about to expire
 
03:11:12.889 --> 03:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:16.130 --> 03:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
what has happened in the last
 
03:11:22.190 --> 03:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
four or five years
 
03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
our energy Market has changed somewhat
 
03:11:27.050 --> 03:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
because divestiture was finally
 
03:11:30.050 --> 03:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
completed the restructuring of 1996 was
 
03:11:31.610 --> 03:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
finally completed
 
03:11:34.130 --> 03:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
by the requirement that PSNH divest
 
03:11:36.889 --> 03:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
itself of all its generation assets so
 
03:11:40.849 --> 03:11:40.859 align:start position:0%
now PSNH buys its energy from the iso
 
03:11:43.389 --> 03:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
New England grid from the market
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
no longer produces any energy itself
 
03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
when PSNH and Burgess signed the
 
03:11:53.389 --> 03:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:56.510 --> 03:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
it was envisioned that the electricity
 
03:11:58.969 --> 03:11:58.979 align:start position:0%
that came from Burgess would be a hedge
 
03:12:02.450 --> 03:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
that bsnh would use against the price of
 
03:12:05.389 --> 03:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
power that it could generate itself now
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
that it don't no longer generates power
 
03:12:10.730 --> 03:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
that hedge is no longer
 
03:12:12.290 --> 03:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
a workable
 
03:12:12.300 --> 03:12:17.269 align:start position:0%
a workable
solution

03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:17.279 --> 03:12:18.290 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:12:18.290 --> 03:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:12:21.349 --> 03:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 577.
 
03:12:24.530 --> 03:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
from 2018 I think now
 
03:12:27.710 --> 03:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
was probably a mistake on the part of
 
03:12:29.630 --> 03:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
this legislature
 
03:12:32.110 --> 03:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature should never have gotten
 
03:12:35.090 --> 03:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
involved in a private contract between
 
03:12:39.170 --> 03:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
two business entities
 
03:12:42.050 --> 03:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
a contract is a contract
 
03:12:43.969 --> 03:12:43.979 align:start position:0%
the parties agree to it and then they
 
03:12:45.590 --> 03:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
have to live by it
 
03:12:48.290 --> 03:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
and if the legislature subverts the
 
03:12:51.230 --> 03:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
terms of a contract
 
03:12:53.330 --> 03:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
even though its intentions may have been
 
03:12:53.340 --> 03:12:55.070 align:start position:0%
even though its intentions may have been
good

03:12:55.070 --> 03:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:12:56.990 --> 03:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's probably not in the long-term
 
03:13:00.170 --> 03:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
interest of either the parties
 
03:13:05.870 --> 03:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:07.969 --> 03:13:07.979 align:start position:0%
that's a long-winded background way of
 
03:13:09.889 --> 03:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
saying that I think it's come it's time
 
03:13:12.469 --> 03:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
for this legislator to legislature to
 
03:13:14.630 --> 03:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
correct its mistake the mistake it made
 
03:13:18.230 --> 03:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
with the Senate bill 577.
 
03:13:21.889 --> 03:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
I think it's time to roll back the clock
 
03:13:25.010 --> 03:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
to 2018.
 
03:13:27.410 --> 03:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to be proposing an
 
03:13:29.870 --> 03:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
amendment and I've passed out a copy of
 
03:13:31.610 --> 03:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
it to all of you it's amendment number
 
03:13:31.620 --> 03:13:36.469 align:start position:0%
it to all of you it's amendment number
2023-071h

03:13:36.469 --> 03:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:39.590 --> 03:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:39.600 --> 03:13:41.830 align:start position:0%
 
will

03:13:41.830 --> 03:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
reset the clock to 2018 essentially
 
03:13:47.870 --> 03:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
it will wipe out
 
03:13:51.410 --> 03:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
any accumulated over-market energy costs
 
03:13:54.230 --> 03:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
that have accrued since 2018 and forgive
 
03:13:54.240 --> 03:13:56.690 align:start position:0%
that have accrued since 2018 and forgive
them

03:13:56.690 --> 03:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:00.050 --> 03:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
Burgess will not be required to to pay
 
03:14:00.060 --> 03:14:02.330 align:start position:0%
Burgess will not be required to to pay
those

03:14:02.330 --> 03:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:14:04.969 --> 03:14:04.979 align:start position:0%
over Market costs back
 
03:14:07.490 --> 03:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly significant amount of
 
03:14:09.710 --> 03:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
money somewhere around 48 million
 
03:14:09.720 --> 03:14:12.050 align:start position:0%
money somewhere around 48 million
dollars

03:14:12.050 --> 03:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:14:14.330 --> 03:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
but I think since the legislature
 
03:14:14.340 --> 03:14:16.190 align:start position:0%
but I think since the legislature
created

03:14:16.190 --> 03:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
created
 
03:14:19.130 --> 03:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
that 488 million dollar
 
03:14:19.140 --> 03:14:20.809 align:start position:0%
that 488 million dollar
obligation

03:14:20.809 --> 03:14:20.819 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
03:14:24.710 --> 03:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:26.389 --> 03:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
since it's already been recovered
 
03:14:30.130 --> 03:14:30.140 align:start position:0%
through stranded cost recovery
 
03:14:32.870 --> 03:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
rates by the utility
 
03:14:36.889 --> 03:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
the legislature can forgive that debt
 
03:14:38.750 --> 03:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
so that's what I propose to do in this
 
03:14:38.760 --> 03:14:43.849 align:start position:0%
so that's what I propose to do in this
amendment

03:14:43.849 --> 03:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:47.090 --> 03:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
by resetting the clock I mean that with
 
03:14:49.429 --> 03:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
that debt gone
 
03:14:49.439 --> 03:14:51.469 align:start position:0%
that debt gone
now

03:14:51.469 --> 03:14:51.479 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:14:54.710 --> 03:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
any further over-market energy costs
 
03:14:56.870 --> 03:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
that accumulate
 
03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
above the 100 million that's already
 
03:15:03.769 --> 03:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
established by the p in the PPA will
 
03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
have to be paid back according to the
 
03:15:09.650 --> 03:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
and if that
 
03:15:12.950 --> 03:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
03:15:17.570 --> 03:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
for either PCN PSNH or for Burgess
 
03:15:18.950 --> 03:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
then the two of them need to get
 
03:15:20.389 --> 03:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
together and figure out how to make it
 
03:15:23.389 --> 03:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
work it's not up to the legislature to
 
03:15:24.889 --> 03:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
make that work
 
03:15:27.590 --> 03:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's up to the companies who the parties
 
03:15:29.929 --> 03:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
who are the parties of a private
 
03:15:29.939 --> 03:15:31.010 align:start position:0%
who are the parties of a private
contract

03:15:31.010 --> 03:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
contract
 
03:15:34.730 --> 03:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:37.010 --> 03:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
so that's why I've proposed this
 
03:15:40.969 --> 03:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
amendment That Forgives the the debt
 
03:15:43.309 --> 03:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
and then holds the parties to the terms
 
03:15:45.830 --> 03:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the contract
 
03:15:54.349 --> 03:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:55.969 --> 03:15:55.979 align:start position:0%
I think it's in the best interest
 
03:15:58.670 --> 03:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
interest of the economics of the State
 
03:16:01.010 --> 03:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
03:16:04.550 --> 03:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
that we step aside and step out of the
 
03:16:07.730 --> 03:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
way and let this process between these
 
03:16:12.950 --> 03:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:15.710 --> 03:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
I've submitted written testimony and in
 
03:16:17.929 --> 03:16:17.939 align:start position:0%
my written testimony I talk a little bit
 
03:16:17.939 --> 03:16:19.610 align:start position:0%
my written testimony I talk a little bit
about

03:16:19.610 --> 03:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:16:19.620 --> 03:16:21.769 align:start position:0%
about
the

03:16:21.769 --> 03:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:16:21.779 --> 03:16:23.150 align:start position:0%
the
docket

03:16:23.150 --> 03:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
docket
 
03:16:25.429 --> 03:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
the proceeding at the Public Utilities
 
03:16:28.010 --> 03:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
Commission to approve the PPA way back
 
03:16:30.590 --> 03:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
in 2010 some of the testimony from that
 
03:16:33.050 --> 03:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
docket I also talk about
 
03:16:35.630 --> 03:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that people may
 
03:16:40.910 --> 03:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
have that if we pass this legislation
 
03:16:44.690 --> 03:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
Burgess may decide to close and jobs
 
03:16:47.510 --> 03:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
will be lost
 
03:16:50.330 --> 03:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
but I would remind people that
 
03:16:53.570 --> 03:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
when you subsidize jobs in a protected
 
03:16:53.580 --> 03:16:55.250 align:start position:0%
when you subsidize jobs in a protected
industry

03:16:55.250 --> 03:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:16:57.530 --> 03:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
it can be very expensive
 
03:17:00.230 --> 03:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
the Peterson Institute for example
 
03:17:02.210 --> 03:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
speculates that it cost two hundred
 
03:17:04.429 --> 03:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars annually for each
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:15.530 --> 03:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
it's never fun it's never
 
03:17:15.540 --> 03:17:16.910 align:start position:0%
it's never fun it's never
easy

03:17:16.910 --> 03:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
easy
 
03:17:19.070 --> 03:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
to say that jobs may be lost but if
 
03:17:20.690 --> 03:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
that's what happens that's what happens
 
03:17:25.849 --> 03:17:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:28.190 --> 03:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that won't happen
 
03:17:31.429 --> 03:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that with a relatively High
 
03:17:33.590 --> 03:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
Cost of energy today electricity today
 
03:17:36.290 --> 03:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
that Burgess will be able to continue to
 
03:17:36.300 --> 03:17:38.150 align:start position:0%
that Burgess will be able to continue to
function

03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
function
 
03:17:40.490 --> 03:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
under the terms of the PPA
 
03:17:44.090 --> 03:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
or if they can't that they will get
 
03:17:46.610 --> 03:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
together with PSNH or eversource and try
 
03:17:48.410 --> 03:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
to work out an arrangement that will
 
03:17:48.420 --> 03:17:50.929 align:start position:0%
to work out an arrangement that will
work

03:17:50.929 --> 03:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:54.050 --> 03:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
and that the PPA or that the Public
 
03:17:56.389 --> 03:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission can approve because
 
03:17:58.730 --> 03:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
any alteration of the existing PPA would
 
03:18:03.349 --> 03:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:06.110 --> 03:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
so that is going to conclude my
 
03:18:07.670 --> 03:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
testimony I'll take questions of course
 
03:18:09.769 --> 03:18:09.779 align:start position:0%
and then there are other people who will
 
03:18:12.769 --> 03:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
want to speak on this issue as well I'm
 
03:18:12.779 --> 03:18:16.070 align:start position:0%
want to speak on this issue as well I'm
sure

03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:17.929 --> 03:18:17.939 align:start position:0%
representative Winnie Thompson's Thomas
 
03:18:17.939 --> 03:18:20.269 align:start position:0%
representative Winnie Thompson's Thomas
oh

03:18:20.269 --> 03:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
New York
 
03:18:23.150 --> 03:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
um I
 
03:18:24.830 --> 03:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and I have
 
03:18:28.309 --> 03:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
two clarification questions one is in
 
03:18:30.410 --> 03:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
the original Bill not the amendment on
 
03:18:34.490 --> 03:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
lines 16 and 17 it says um
 
03:18:36.769 --> 03:18:36.779 align:start position:0%
all relief provided to the plant shall
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
be deemed to be reasonable legitimate
 
03:18:40.730 --> 03:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
and in the public interest how will
 
03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
those be determined and or measured
 
03:18:47.389 --> 03:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
those are well-defined terms by the
 
03:18:50.030 --> 03:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission
 
03:18:53.690 --> 03:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
and in this legislation it it just says
 
03:18:57.769 --> 03:18:57.779 align:start position:0%
that the legislature is saying that the
 
03:18:57.779 --> 03:18:59.510 align:start position:0%
that the legislature is saying that the
terms

03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
terms
 
03:19:03.050 --> 03:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
are judged to be just and reasonable so
 
03:19:04.670 --> 03:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
there's illegal Amendment legislation
 
03:19:09.349 --> 03:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment Amendment text has the same
 
03:19:11.150 --> 03:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
um all right and my second question is
 
03:19:13.130 --> 03:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
um you you talked about the 48 million
 
03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
that would be um forgiven would that
 
03:19:20.870 --> 03:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:23.870 --> 03:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
it will not because the funds have
 
03:19:25.969 --> 03:19:25.979 align:start position:0%
already been recovered by the utility
 
03:19:29.210 --> 03:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
and its stranded cost recovery charge
 
03:19:32.450 --> 03:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:34.910 --> 03:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington thank you um
 
03:19:36.530 --> 03:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so just
 
03:19:38.090 --> 03:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
to make this clear what we're basically
 
03:19:41.090 --> 03:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
saying is that the contract as it was
 
03:19:43.929 --> 03:19:43.939 align:start position:0%
originally agreed to and actually
 
03:19:46.490 --> 03:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
dramatically pursued by the biomass
 
03:19:48.469 --> 03:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
facility they wanted this contract
 
03:19:51.410 --> 03:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
really really bad and it went to the puc
 
03:19:54.889 --> 03:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
the puc originally rejected it because
 
03:19:56.690 --> 03:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
they didn't like some of the stuff in it
 
03:19:58.330 --> 03:19:58.340 align:start position:0%
it was then
 
03:20:00.590 --> 03:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
renegotiated between the two parties and
 
03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
approved by the puc that was in effect
 
03:20:05.630 --> 03:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
and it remains in effect now but what
 
03:20:08.530 --> 03:20:08.540 align:start position:0%
you're saying is the amount of
 
03:20:10.849 --> 03:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
over-market rates that have been being
 
03:20:14.630 --> 03:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
paid by the rate payers from 2018 until
 
03:20:17.210 --> 03:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
the enactment of this bill if it passes
 
03:20:19.969 --> 03:20:19.979 align:start position:0%
is going to be forgiven that's the
 
03:20:21.830 --> 03:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
amount of 48 million dollars so the rate
 
03:20:23.809 --> 03:20:23.819 align:start position:0%
payers would have eventually handed
 
03:20:26.150 --> 03:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
Burgess biomass of 48 million dollar
 
03:20:26.160 --> 03:20:28.070 align:start position:0%
Burgess biomass of 48 million dollar
check

03:20:28.070 --> 03:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
check
 
03:20:31.910 --> 03:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
no I'm not saying that because the money
 
03:20:33.530 --> 03:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
has already been the 48 million has
 
03:20:35.269 --> 03:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
already been recovered by the utility
 
03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
and its stranded cost recovery charge so
 
03:20:39.469 --> 03:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
all of us rate payers have already paid
 
03:20:42.010 --> 03:20:42.020 align:start position:0%
it follow-up
 
03:20:45.290 --> 03:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
well we wouldn't have paid it if we
 
03:20:48.050 --> 03:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
hadn't given this bill passed in other
 
03:20:51.230 --> 03:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
words the only reason that it's the rate
 
03:20:53.870 --> 03:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
pay is paid that bill is because of the
 
03:20:56.450 --> 03:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
of the laws that would change eventually
 
03:20:58.610 --> 03:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
all the money would have had been paid
 
03:21:00.410 --> 03:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
back by Burgess in according with the
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
contract so in effect the rate pay is a
 
03:21:04.610 --> 03:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
giving even though they've already paid
 
03:21:06.830 --> 03:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
it through the stranded cost they have
 
03:21:09.830 --> 03:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
and will can give Burgess about 48
 
03:21:11.990 --> 03:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars that was not in
 
03:21:13.849 --> 03:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
compliance with the contracted Burgess
 
03:21:13.859 --> 03:21:15.650 align:start position:0%
compliance with the contracted Burgess
negotiated

03:21:15.650 --> 03:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
negotiated
 
03:21:17.870 --> 03:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct but what I'm saying
 
03:21:20.450 --> 03:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
is that that 48 million
 
03:21:22.550 --> 03:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have accrued had this
 
03:21:24.830 --> 03:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
legislature not stepped in with Senate
 
03:21:31.969 --> 03:21:31.979 align:start position:0%
Bill 577 and it created a uh a pause if
 
03:21:36.110 --> 03:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
you will a suspension of uh the terms of
 
03:21:38.510 --> 03:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
the PPA follow up and let's be the last
 
03:21:38.520 --> 03:21:40.610 align:start position:0%
the PPA follow up and let's be the last
one

03:21:40.610 --> 03:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:21:42.769 --> 03:21:42.779 align:start position:0%
well when you say it wouldn't be accrued
 
03:21:45.410 --> 03:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
by because Burgess would have gone out
 
03:21:46.790 --> 03:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
of business or they would have paid the
 
03:21:49.309 --> 03:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
money back no because the terms of the
 
03:21:52.790 --> 03:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
PPA say that once the hundred million
 
03:21:55.490 --> 03:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
dollar level is reached any further over
 
03:21:57.349 --> 03:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
Market charges have to be paid back
 
03:22:00.110 --> 03:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
within the next 12 months so on a year
 
03:22:01.790 --> 03:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
by year basis
 
03:22:04.010 --> 03:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
Burgess would either have had to pay
 
03:22:06.889 --> 03:22:06.899 align:start position:0%
those over Market charges back
 
03:22:10.790 --> 03:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
or they would have violated the terms of
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
the PPA
 
03:22:15.050 --> 03:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
and because the PPA went into effect in
 
03:22:15.060 --> 03:22:16.190 align:start position:0%
and because the PPA went into effect in
20

03:22:16.190 --> 03:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
20
 
03:22:18.349 --> 03:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
19 or so
 
03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
approximately 48 million has accumulated
 
03:22:24.889 --> 03:22:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:28.010 --> 03:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
okay okay seeing another question from
 
03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
03:22:32.870 --> 03:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
three times in a row I got that right
 
03:22:34.490 --> 03:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:22:36.469 --> 03:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm sorry but I'm
 
03:22:38.570 --> 03:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
still a bit confused about this 48
 
03:22:38.580 --> 03:22:40.370 align:start position:0%
still a bit confused about this 48
million

03:22:40.370 --> 03:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:22:42.830 --> 03:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's money that has already been charged
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
to the rate payer as you said so what
 
03:22:48.590 --> 03:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
we're free what are we forgiving is
 
03:22:50.450 --> 03:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
there money that is there 48 million
 
03:22:52.910 --> 03:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
that is coming from somewhere not coming
 
03:22:55.130 --> 03:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
from somewhere going somewhere not going
 
03:22:56.570 --> 03:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere and I'm talking about going
 
03:22:58.969 --> 03:22:58.979 align:start position:0%
forward not in the past okay good
 
03:23:01.309 --> 03:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
question my apologies for not explaining
 
03:23:03.530 --> 03:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
it thoroughly to begin with
 
03:23:08.110 --> 03:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
so the way the PPA works is that
 
03:23:11.570 --> 03:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
a fund was uh
 
03:23:14.630 --> 03:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
the PPA was was created with something
 
03:23:18.769 --> 03:23:18.779 align:start position:0%
called a cumulative reduction Factor
 
03:23:21.410 --> 03:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
the cumulative reduction Factor
 
03:23:25.309 --> 03:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
was a accounting way of accounting for
 
03:23:29.450 --> 03:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:29.460 --> 03:23:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:23:31.070 --> 03:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:23:32.990 --> 03:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
the CRF
 
03:23:35.950 --> 03:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
as it was called was set up
 
03:23:39.050 --> 03:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
within at the recommendation of the PPA
 
03:23:43.490 --> 03:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
to be capped at 100 million dollars
 
03:23:46.610 --> 03:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
once it reached 100 million dollars then
 
03:23:50.090 --> 03:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
the terms of the PPA were that the any
 
03:23:52.490 --> 03:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
excess funds over that hundred million
 
03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
would be returned to to uh rate payers
 
03:24:00.769 --> 03:24:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:05.809 --> 03:24:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:09.590 --> 03:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
that provision of the PPA therefore the
 
03:24:11.570 --> 03:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
fund began to accumulate
 
03:24:14.870 --> 03:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
Monies that were not paid back in a
 
03:24:16.309 --> 03:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
12-month period
 
03:24:19.090 --> 03:24:19.100 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the three years
 
03:24:21.670 --> 03:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
well now almost four years
 
03:24:25.490 --> 03:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
suspension of that CRF the funds that
 
03:24:29.269 --> 03:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
have accumulated are roughly 48 million
 
03:24:31.670 --> 03:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
does that explain it
 
03:24:31.680 --> 03:24:39.170 align:start position:0%
does that explain it
okay

03:24:39.170 --> 03:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative Christian
 
03:24:42.889 --> 03:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
03:24:42.899 --> 03:24:44.090 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

03:24:44.090 --> 03:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:24:46.610 --> 03:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
um so my understanding based on some
 
03:24:48.590 --> 03:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
Communications I've received is that
 
03:24:48.600 --> 03:24:50.150 align:start position:0%
Communications I've received is that
currently

03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:24:52.550 --> 03:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
um Burgess is only receiving eight cents
 
03:24:55.010 --> 03:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
a kilowatt hour for their energy under
 
03:24:57.229 --> 03:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
the current agreement versus like the
 
03:25:00.410 --> 03:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
default rate is 22 will that be
 
03:25:02.690 --> 03:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
brought back into balance going forward
 
03:25:06.229 --> 03:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
or does this not impact that at all
 
03:25:09.290 --> 03:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
now this legislation does not
 
03:25:13.070 --> 03:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
in any way change the PPA that's that
 
03:25:17.030 --> 03:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
can only be done by the parties that are
 
03:25:17.040 --> 03:25:18.469 align:start position:0%
can only be done by the parties that are
um

03:25:18.469 --> 03:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:21.170 --> 03:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
part of the PPA who the two parties that
 
03:25:23.630 --> 03:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
negotiated the PPA and any changes they
 
03:25:25.130 --> 03:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
make to it will have to be approved by
 
03:25:30.410 --> 03:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:32.570 --> 03:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
see any other questions thank you so
 
03:25:35.809 --> 03:25:35.819 align:start position:0%
much uh chairman Rose for your testimony
 
03:25:39.769 --> 03:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
I will call next Mr Tom Franz from the
 
03:25:43.010 --> 03:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
03:25:45.410 --> 03:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
good evening well it almost feels like
 
03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:10.010 --> 03:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:12.830 --> 03:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:14.870 --> 03:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
03:26:17.750 --> 03:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
on hb142 a bill relative to the
 
03:26:20.269 --> 03:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
operation of the Burgess biopower plant
 
03:26:22.309 --> 03:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
I am Tom Frantz director of the
 
03:26:24.290 --> 03:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
regulatory support division of the New
 
03:26:25.969 --> 03:26:25.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy
 
03:26:27.650 --> 03:26:27.660 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of energy
 
03:26:32.030 --> 03:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
opposes HB 142 and my comments this
 
03:26:34.670 --> 03:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
morning this afternoon addressed the
 
03:26:36.830 --> 03:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
original Bill and not not the amendment
 
03:26:38.990 --> 03:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
which we haven't reviewed yet and we'd
 
03:26:41.929 --> 03:26:41.939 align:start position:0%
be happy to take a look at
 
03:26:41.939 --> 03:26:42.650 align:start position:0%
be happy to take a look at
um

03:26:42.650 --> 03:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:46.250 --> 03:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
HP 142 would protect the continued
 
03:26:48.490 --> 03:26:48.500 align:start position:0%
operation the birds biopower plant
 
03:26:51.349 --> 03:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's clearly stated in the proposed
 
03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
original HB 142 Bill and how does it do
 
03:26:56.330 --> 03:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
that by removing the protection of
 
03:26:58.370 --> 03:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
forwarded rate payers in the puc's order
 
03:27:02.570 --> 03:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
approving the PPA back in 2011.
 
03:27:06.050 --> 03:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose gave a very thorough and
 
03:27:07.790 --> 03:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
accurate description of the history of
 
03:27:09.650 --> 03:27:09.660 align:start position:0%
this so I'm not going to spend a lot of
 
03:27:12.050 --> 03:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
time on that although I had comments on
 
03:27:14.690 --> 03:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
it earlier but he addressed it the
 
03:27:17.690 --> 03:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
history of the uh PPA rather rather
 
03:27:19.550 --> 03:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
clearly and well
 
03:27:22.010 --> 03:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
that protection as he mentioned did cap
 
03:27:25.190 --> 03:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
over Market costs at a hundred million
 
03:27:25.200 --> 03:27:26.150 align:start position:0%
over Market costs at a hundred million
dollars

03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:27:28.010 --> 03:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
through through that cumulative
 
03:27:30.590 --> 03:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
reduction Factor
 
03:27:34.490 --> 03:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
and of course that has been an issue at
 
03:27:39.530 --> 03:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:44.210 --> 03:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
the original order proving this PPA
 
03:27:47.450 --> 03:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
clearly stated that the the cumulative
 
03:27:49.550 --> 03:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
reduction Factor was intended and I
 
03:27:53.269 --> 03:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
quote to mitigate risk to customers
 
03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
this bill as originally proposed HP 142
 
03:28:01.490 --> 03:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
would direct the PC to amend any of its
 
03:28:03.410 --> 03:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
orders is necessary to protect the
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
continued operation of the plant no
 
03:28:07.969 --> 03:28:07.979 align:start position:0%
matter what those costs are
 
03:28:10.429 --> 03:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
so the original order
 
03:28:12.830 --> 03:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
trying to balance rate payers interests
 
03:28:15.590 --> 03:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
with those of the owner of the plant and
 
03:28:17.630 --> 03:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
and the benefits that accrue to the
 
03:28:22.190 --> 03:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
facility clearly would be taken out of
 
03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
that equation
 
03:28:28.250 --> 03:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
so the cumulative reduction Factor
 
03:28:32.870 --> 03:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
in 145 to 48 million dollar range uh
 
03:28:35.030 --> 03:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
under this bill would remain and
 
03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
potentially increase
 
03:28:40.969 --> 03:28:40.979 align:start position:0%
so that balance those costs those risks
 
03:28:43.510 --> 03:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
to customers would continue under the
 
03:28:46.490 --> 03:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
hb-142 as proposed
 
03:28:48.410 --> 03:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
this is an example what New Hampshire's
 
03:28:50.990 --> 03:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
10-year energy strategy States would
 
03:28:53.929 --> 03:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
should be avoided expensive targeted
 
03:28:56.150 --> 03:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
payments to specific
 
03:28:56.160 --> 03:28:57.550 align:start position:0%
payments to specific
favored

03:28:57.550 --> 03:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
favored
 
03:29:00.530 --> 03:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
non-technologically neutral plants at
 
03:29:03.950 --> 03:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
high cost and at risk the rate payers
 
03:29:06.050 --> 03:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons the New Hampshire
 
03:29:12.530 --> 03:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:16.309 --> 03:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Franz for being here this
 
03:29:21.410 --> 03:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
morning representative Harrington has a
 
03:29:22.550 --> 03:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
03:29:24.050 --> 03:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Trina and thank you for taking
 
03:29:26.510 --> 03:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
my question it seems to be the issue
 
03:29:28.849 --> 03:29:28.859 align:start position:0%
here is where is the money going to come
 
03:29:30.590 --> 03:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
from if they have to continue to pay
 
03:29:33.050 --> 03:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
this this back now in your experience in
 
03:29:35.030 --> 03:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
the electric markets in New England have
 
03:29:37.130 --> 03:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
there been previous plants where they
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
simply weren't found economical and did
 
03:29:42.110 --> 03:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
they close or were they just we sold
 
03:29:45.590 --> 03:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
into the market at a lower price
 
03:29:48.110 --> 03:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
well over the long term you have to at
 
03:29:51.050 --> 03:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
least cover uh all your costs to stay
 
03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
economically viable in the short term if
 
03:29:55.610 --> 03:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
you're covering at least all your
 
03:29:57.530 --> 03:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
variable costs you could run for a while
 
03:29:59.630 --> 03:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
hoping that market conditions will
 
03:30:02.389 --> 03:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
change or costs underlying the facility
 
03:30:05.750 --> 03:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
will be lower and net over the long term
 
03:30:07.550 --> 03:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
you can cover your variable costs and
 
03:30:10.550 --> 03:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
fixed costs but the short answer to that
 
03:30:13.010 --> 03:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
question is some plants close we've seen
 
03:30:15.769 --> 03:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
that across New England that they've
 
03:30:18.530 --> 03:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
assessed the market their own cost
 
03:30:21.710 --> 03:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
structure and determine that the costs
 
03:30:23.389 --> 03:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
exceed the revenues they're receiving or
 
03:30:25.370 --> 03:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
will receive over the over the long term
 
03:30:27.370 --> 03:30:27.380 align:start position:0%
and they've closed
 
03:30:30.050 --> 03:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
other plants will
 
03:30:32.090 --> 03:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
stay in operation for a while hoping
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
that either prices go up or costs go
 
03:30:37.370 --> 03:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
down or both and that they'll uh be
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
profitable over the long term I think it
 
03:30:42.530 --> 03:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
varies somewhat based on the plant the
 
03:30:42.540 --> 03:30:43.630 align:start position:0%
varies somewhat based on the plant the
fuel

03:30:43.630 --> 03:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
fuel
 
03:30:46.969 --> 03:30:46.979 align:start position:0%
even where they're located
 
03:30:46.979 --> 03:30:48.530 align:start position:0%
even where they're located
follow-up

03:30:48.530 --> 03:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:30:51.229 --> 03:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah and would a third option
 
03:30:53.090 --> 03:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
be that some plants that couldn't
 
03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
operate under the present price
 
03:30:57.170 --> 03:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
structure because what they owed what
 
03:30:59.389 --> 03:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
their contracts were would simply sell
 
03:31:01.969 --> 03:31:01.979 align:start position:0%
their plant to somebody else maybe at a
 
03:31:04.309 --> 03:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
reduced cost and that new buyer then
 
03:31:05.990 --> 03:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
could operate with the lower Capital
 
03:31:08.450 --> 03:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
cost involved and may operate as well
 
03:31:10.969 --> 03:31:10.979 align:start position:0%
that's definitely an option also and
 
03:31:13.550 --> 03:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
that has also occurred all those in a
 
03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
very large involved complex market like
 
03:31:19.190 --> 03:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh we have in ice and New England have
 
03:31:24.889 --> 03:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
03:31:28.429 --> 03:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:31:31.190 --> 03:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so I'm curious
 
03:31:33.729 --> 03:31:33.739 align:start position:0%
about these plants that have closed have
 
03:31:36.110 --> 03:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
what sorts of fuel sources have they
 
03:31:37.670 --> 03:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
used I mean have there been biomass
 
03:31:39.410 --> 03:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
plants that are closed oh yes natural
 
03:31:45.290 --> 03:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
gas oil I mean what's what's closed uh
 
03:31:48.530 --> 03:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
basically all of the above
 
03:31:52.610 --> 03:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh oil plants have closed uh essentially
 
03:31:55.130 --> 03:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
they don't run very often anyway they
 
03:31:57.410 --> 03:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
have what we have we call a low capacity
 
03:31:57.420 --> 03:31:59.510 align:start position:0%
have what we have we call a low capacity
factors

03:31:59.510 --> 03:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
factors
 
03:32:03.469 --> 03:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
PSNH owned one it's still running uh the
 
03:32:05.389 --> 03:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
capacity factor in that plant the last I
 
03:32:07.370 --> 03:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
saw was under one percent
 
03:32:10.630 --> 03:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh it basically is what we call a
 
03:32:13.910 --> 03:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
capacity Revenue plan that it gets
 
03:32:16.490 --> 03:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
revenue from the iso New England forward
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
capacity market and and really doesn't
 
03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
depend at all on Energy prices for its
 
03:32:26.030 --> 03:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream it because of oil is a
 
03:32:28.610 --> 03:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
high priced uh fuel on the margin for
 
03:32:30.410 --> 03:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
the most part in New England and it's
 
03:32:33.349 --> 03:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
there to run when ISO really needs to
 
03:32:36.710 --> 03:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
keep the grid up uh and so those plants
 
03:32:39.769 --> 03:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
are Bid in to the forward capacity
 
03:32:42.530 --> 03:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
market and if they clear they get the
 
03:32:44.929 --> 03:32:44.939 align:start position:0%
forward capacity Market costs I mean
 
03:32:47.809 --> 03:32:47.819 align:start position:0%
revenue stream and they may run very
 
03:32:49.610 --> 03:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
very little but when they are asked to
 
03:32:51.950 --> 03:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
run they better run or there's a penalty
 
03:32:54.830 --> 03:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
provision so those many oil plants
 
03:32:57.429 --> 03:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
closed especially in the early to mid
 
03:32:59.469 --> 03:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
2000 Range
 
03:33:02.030 --> 03:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
the biomass facilities that were under
 
03:33:05.150 --> 03:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
qualifying facility purpose rates as
 
03:33:09.469 --> 03:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
representative Bose mentioned when those
 
03:33:13.010 --> 03:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
20-year read orders ended many of them
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
stayed open for a while but most of
 
03:33:20.030 --> 03:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
those are now closed and and we had
 
03:33:24.070 --> 03:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
that one time I think uh eight or nine
 
03:33:26.570 --> 03:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
biomass qfs
 
03:33:29.809 --> 03:33:29.819 align:start position:0%
so only a couple of those are are still
 
03:33:29.819 --> 03:33:30.889 align:start position:0%
so only a couple of those are are still
operational

03:33:30.889 --> 03:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
operational
 
03:33:32.929 --> 03:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
and usually when the prices are fairly
 
03:33:35.090 --> 03:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
high in ice and New England Market
 
03:33:37.370 --> 03:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
coal plants have all but disappeared
 
03:33:40.370 --> 03:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
from the region except for Merrimack the
 
03:33:43.550 --> 03:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
last operating coal plant in the region
 
03:33:45.710 --> 03:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
and we even had nuclear power plants
 
03:33:48.590 --> 03:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
close in the in the late 90s mid to late
 
03:33:48.600 --> 03:33:51.290 align:start position:0%
close in the in the late 90s mid to late
90s

03:33:51.290 --> 03:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:53.750 --> 03:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay I'd remind everybody that we have
 
03:33:55.969 --> 03:33:55.979 align:start position:0%
six cards left here we have a hard stop
 
03:33:58.389 --> 03:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock
 
03:34:01.190 --> 03:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
03:34:01.200 --> 03:34:02.150 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
chair

03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:34:02.160 --> 03:34:03.110 align:start position:0%
chair
um

03:34:03.110 --> 03:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:05.210 --> 03:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what is causing this
 
03:34:07.969 --> 03:34:07.979 align:start position:0%
biomass plant to run so inefficient and
 
03:34:11.349 --> 03:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
inefficiently is it leadership is it
 
03:34:14.990 --> 03:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
prices well
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say it uh
 
03:34:19.729 --> 03:34:19.739 align:start position:0%
I we we did an audit at the department
 
03:34:22.429 --> 03:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
of energy on the plant and and
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
there was nothing there that would
 
03:34:27.769 --> 03:34:27.779 align:start position:0%
state that this is a poorly run plant we
 
03:34:30.250 --> 03:34:30.260 align:start position:0%
think the Management's well done the
 
03:34:33.530 --> 03:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
employees are top-notch the facilities
 
03:34:36.769 --> 03:34:36.779 align:start position:0%
really for biomass facilities as as and
 
03:34:39.410 --> 03:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
I visited lots of biomass Phillies as as
 
03:34:41.210 --> 03:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
fine of biomass facilities you'll
 
03:34:42.229 --> 03:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
probably find
 
03:34:43.969 --> 03:34:43.979 align:start position:0%
it's an inefficient way to make
 
03:34:48.349 --> 03:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
electricity As You Are basically burning
 
03:34:51.229 --> 03:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
wood chips with high moisture contents
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh just spin it spin a turban
 
03:34:58.849 --> 03:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
and and those heat rates
 
03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
if the fuel is cheap enough
 
03:35:04.510 --> 03:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
you can you can do it fairly cheaply but
 
03:35:08.090 --> 03:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh wood is not a very cheap commodity
 
03:35:12.050 --> 03:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
and the efficiency of even a fine
 
03:35:12.060 --> 03:35:13.490 align:start position:0%
and the efficiency of even a fine
facility

03:35:13.490 --> 03:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:35:16.130 --> 03:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
has a high heat rate content so it takes
 
03:35:18.290 --> 03:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of heat to actually produce one
 
03:35:23.090 --> 03:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour of electricity follow-up
 
03:35:26.330 --> 03:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
um so given that it appears to be the
 
03:35:29.090 --> 03:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
type of energy that it's that it's using
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
how can we ensure that giving this
 
03:35:35.389 --> 03:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
subsidy will result in them running any
 
03:35:37.250 --> 03:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
more efficiently in the future and and
 
03:35:39.170 --> 03:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
not just getting back to this point
 
03:35:41.330 --> 03:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
again at some at some time
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any guarantee of
 
03:35:45.469 --> 03:35:45.479 align:start position:0%
that there's no guarantee I don't I I
 
03:35:48.229 --> 03:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
think in today's high gas price Market
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
we see plants that could run
 
03:35:53.929 --> 03:35:53.939 align:start position:0%
in the market more than we've seen when
 
03:35:56.030 --> 03:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
gas prices are low when natural gas
 
03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
prices are low this this plant will
 
03:36:02.929 --> 03:36:02.939 align:start position:0%
without a doubt uh be above Market thank
 
03:36:02.939 --> 03:36:04.910 align:start position:0%
without a doubt uh be above Market thank
you

03:36:04.910 --> 03:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:36:07.729 --> 03:36:07.739 align:start position:0%
representative Noel has a question thank
 
03:36:09.229 --> 03:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
03:36:11.269 --> 03:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
question uh with your perspective on the
 
03:36:13.729 --> 03:36:13.739 align:start position:0%
on the plant here uh the price that they
 
03:36:16.490 --> 03:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
negotiated in the PPA originally was
 
03:36:18.769 --> 03:36:18.779 align:start position:0%
that a reasonable price or did it
 
03:36:23.090 --> 03:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
reflect their their costs more than uh
 
03:36:25.190 --> 03:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
Public Services costs
 
03:36:27.530 --> 03:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh that's a
 
03:36:29.510 --> 03:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's a multi-multi-million dollar
 
03:36:29.520 --> 03:36:29.980 align:start position:0%
that's a multi-multi-million dollar
question

03:36:29.980 --> 03:36:29.990 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:36:29.990 --> 03:36:32.630 align:start position:0%
question
[Laughter]

03:36:32.630 --> 03:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:36:38.990 --> 03:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
and it was a complex PPA uh 20 years had
 
03:36:41.210 --> 03:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
three basic revenue streams associated
 
03:36:44.330 --> 03:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
with it energy which underlying the
 
03:36:47.050 --> 03:36:47.060 align:start position:0%
energy was the fuel price for wood
 
03:36:49.610 --> 03:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
and the efficiency of converting wood
 
03:36:51.889 --> 03:36:51.899 align:start position:0%
chips into electricity
 
03:36:53.690 --> 03:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
that was
 
03:36:58.190 --> 03:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
Changed by the puc essentially in its uh
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
analysis in order
 
03:37:03.530 --> 03:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
then the capacity revenues which were
 
03:37:05.990 --> 03:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
based on forecasts also and direct
 
03:37:07.849 --> 03:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
prices those are the three major revenue
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
streams and so over a 20-year period
 
03:37:14.510 --> 03:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
some periods are going to look good some
 
03:37:17.870 --> 03:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
periods are going to look bad and uh the
 
03:37:20.030 --> 03:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
low but I think a lot of people missed
 
03:37:25.250 --> 03:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
at the time was that tremendously
 
03:37:27.469 --> 03:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
tremendous technological developments in
 
03:37:31.130 --> 03:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
lowering natural gas prices and and the
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
prices in the 2008 nine time frame 2010
 
03:37:38.030 --> 03:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
even for natural gas we were in the five
 
03:37:40.790 --> 03:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
six dollars per mmbtu and as you know
 
03:37:42.650 --> 03:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
natural gas prices
 
03:37:45.950 --> 03:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh for most of the 2000 teens were down
 
03:37:47.710 --> 03:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:37:50.210 --> 03:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
1.85 to two dollars and fifty cents per
 
03:37:53.090 --> 03:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
mmbtu and since gas is on the margin in
 
03:37:54.830 --> 03:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
ISO New England many many many many
 
03:37:57.290 --> 03:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
hours a high proportion of the hours
 
03:38:00.790 --> 03:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
setting the price that that
 
03:38:04.370 --> 03:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
dramatically and adversely affected uh
 
03:38:16.849 --> 03:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:16.859 --> 03:38:19.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:38:19.130 --> 03:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:29.710 --> 03:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:32.150 --> 03:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
and I just realized I forgot to turn on
 
03:38:34.130 --> 03:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
my mic
 
03:38:50.450 --> 03:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:53.210 --> 03:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I appreciate the
 
03:38:55.309 --> 03:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here today and to
 
03:38:57.790 --> 03:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of Burgess biopower
 
03:39:00.590 --> 03:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
I will give you just a very brief
 
03:39:03.950 --> 03:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
overview of the facility itself before I
 
03:39:05.809 --> 03:39:05.819 align:start position:0%
dive into some of the more relevant
 
03:39:07.969 --> 03:39:07.979 align:start position:0%
issues as they are associated with this
 
03:39:10.130 --> 03:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
with this bill there's also some
 
03:39:11.809 --> 03:39:11.819 align:start position:0%
additional information that I provided
 
03:39:13.309 --> 03:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
in these handouts that I won't touch on
 
03:39:15.650 --> 03:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
for the sake of of being respectful of
 
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
everyone's time
 
03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh Burgess biopower is a 75 megawatt
 
03:39:22.849 --> 03:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
biomass power plant that is located at
 
03:39:24.769 --> 03:39:24.779 align:start position:0%
the site of the former Fraser Mill paper
 
03:39:27.290 --> 03:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
mill in Berlin New Hampshire it's the
 
03:39:29.210 --> 03:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
fourth largest generator in New
 
03:39:31.010 --> 03:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it is the state's largest
 
03:39:32.929 --> 03:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
renewable generator
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
we provide reliable base load power that
 
03:39:38.510 --> 03:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
runs on local fuel instead of out of
 
03:39:42.950 --> 03:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
state natural gas or other fossil fuels
 
03:39:45.170 --> 03:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
we are the largest single buyer of
 
03:39:47.510 --> 03:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
biomass in the state purchasing about
 
03:39:50.030 --> 03:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
800 000 tons of low-grade wood each year
 
03:39:53.630 --> 03:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
from 154 different New Hampshire towns
 
03:39:56.210 --> 03:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
and all 10 counties you'll hear a little
 
03:39:58.370 --> 03:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
bit more about that from some friends
 
03:40:01.010 --> 03:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
that will speak behind us and we make
 
03:40:02.750 --> 03:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
some significant contributions to New
 
03:40:06.050 --> 03:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy we support 240 jobs
 
03:40:09.410 --> 03:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
we provide nearly 70 million dollars in
 
03:40:11.570 --> 03:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
economic activity each year
 
03:40:14.330 --> 03:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
which equates to nearly 1.4 billion
 
03:40:17.929 --> 03:40:17.939 align:start position:0%
dollars over the 20-year life of the PPA
 
03:40:19.910 --> 03:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from mayor Grenier about our
 
03:40:22.790 --> 03:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
contributions to the city of Berlin but
 
03:40:25.429 --> 03:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
generally we support critical energy
 
03:40:28.030 --> 03:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
Independence and fuel diversity
 
03:40:30.889 --> 03:40:30.899 align:start position:0%
especially amid the major changes and
 
03:40:32.809 --> 03:40:32.819 align:start position:0%
disruptions in energy markets that we
 
03:40:34.969 --> 03:40:34.979 align:start position:0%
have seen in recent years and our
 
03:40:38.269 --> 03:40:38.279 align:start position:0%
contract price is stable over time
 
03:40:40.910 --> 03:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
so the facility was developed for really
 
03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
for three reasons and representative
 
03:40:44.510 --> 03:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
Vose did a great job of of giving some
 
03:40:46.010 --> 03:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
of the history there but the first was
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
environmental which was to bring a
 
03:40:50.330 --> 03:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
large-scale renewable generation asset
 
03:40:52.130 --> 03:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire in order to satisfy
 
03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
some of the RPS requirements the second
 
03:40:57.410 --> 03:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
was economics it was to act as an
 
03:40:59.269 --> 03:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
economic anchor in the city of Berlin
 
03:41:00.889 --> 03:41:00.899 align:start position:0%
and the North Country which had been
 
03:41:03.170 --> 03:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
really devastated financially when the
 
03:41:05.090 --> 03:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
Fraser paper mill closed
 
03:41:07.250 --> 03:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
and the third was for energy purposes to
 
03:41:10.190 --> 03:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
be a to be a price stable hedge in the
 
03:41:12.590 --> 03:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
fluctuating energy markets so we have
 
03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
delivered on all of those objectives
 
03:41:17.030 --> 03:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
but the Clause that that representative
 
03:41:19.309 --> 03:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
Vose mentioned that is in our PPA called
 
03:41:21.650 --> 03:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
the cumulative reduction factor or CRF
 
03:41:24.650 --> 03:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
puts the facility at Future risk I think
 
03:41:26.330 --> 03:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that it is a book
 
03:41:28.450 --> 03:41:28.460 align:start position:0%
entry it is not an actual bank account
 
03:41:31.670 --> 03:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
and what that Clause does is it Compares
 
03:41:34.070 --> 03:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
burgess's long-term fixed price of
 
03:41:36.650 --> 03:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
energy against that fluctuating day
 
03:41:39.050 --> 03:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
ahead market price and it tracks the
 
03:41:41.150 --> 03:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
difference between those two
 
03:41:43.550 --> 03:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
as representative Vose mentioned there
 
03:41:45.830 --> 03:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
is a cap on the CRF of 100 million
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
dollars which has been reached the
 
03:41:50.870 --> 03:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
current balance is roughly 148 150
 
03:41:53.570 --> 03:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
million which is roughly equivalent to
 
03:41:55.969 --> 03:41:55.979 align:start position:0%
two years worth of the economic activity
 
03:41:57.769 --> 03:41:57.779 align:start position:0%
that we generate
 
03:41:59.870 --> 03:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important to consider
 
03:42:03.769 --> 03:42:03.779 align:start position:0%
whether the calculation of the CRF is an
 
03:42:06.349 --> 03:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
accurate and accurate reflection of the
 
03:42:09.050 --> 03:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
actual cost to rate payers
 
03:42:11.870 --> 03:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
it Compares our stable energy price
 
03:42:14.210 --> 03:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
against a market price which individual
 
03:42:16.910 --> 03:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
consumers do not actually pay
 
03:42:19.490 --> 03:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
so I think a more accurate estimate of
 
03:42:22.370 --> 03:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
the actual consumer cost of energy is to
 
03:42:24.530 --> 03:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
look at the energy component of default
 
03:42:24.540 --> 03:42:25.550 align:start position:0%
look at the energy component of default
service

03:42:25.550 --> 03:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:42:28.190 --> 03:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
and so for example if the CRF had been
 
03:42:30.889 --> 03:42:30.899 align:start position:0%
calculated by comparing our energy cost
 
03:42:33.530 --> 03:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
to that energy component of default
 
03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
service since 2018 when competitive
 
03:42:37.370 --> 03:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
bidding started
 
03:42:39.710 --> 03:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
it would have peaked at 44 million
 
03:42:42.830 --> 03:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
dollars in October of 2021 it would have
 
03:42:45.590 --> 03:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
steadily declined since then and it
 
03:42:49.370 --> 03:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
would have hit zero in early 2023.
 
03:42:52.130 --> 03:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
but aside from the CRF calculation which
 
03:42:54.590 --> 03:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
is again an accounting mechanism the
 
03:42:57.170 --> 03:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
actual dollar value impact to ratepayers
 
03:42:59.710 --> 03:42:59.720 align:start position:0%
is really based on how our power is used
 
03:43:02.450 --> 03:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
so before divestiture it was
 
03:43:04.250 --> 03:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the default service
 
03:43:07.790 --> 03:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
mix and it served as a as a load reducer
 
03:43:10.250 --> 03:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
but when divestiture occurred the puc
 
03:43:13.130 --> 03:43:13.140 align:start position:0%
directed eversource to to continue to
 
03:43:15.469 --> 03:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
purchase power from us but then to sell
 
03:43:17.330 --> 03:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
our power into the market
 
03:43:19.729 --> 03:43:19.739 align:start position:0%
so now eversource purchase art purchases
 
03:43:21.590 --> 03:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
our power according to the contract at
 
03:43:24.290 --> 03:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
that steady PPA price they resell it
 
03:43:26.929 --> 03:43:26.939 align:start position:0%
into the day ahead market and any cost
 
03:43:28.910 --> 03:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
difference between those two things is
 
03:43:30.889 --> 03:43:30.899 align:start position:0%
recovered from ratepayers
 
03:43:33.830 --> 03:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have any control over how our
 
03:43:36.110 --> 03:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
power is used once it has been purchased
 
03:43:37.910 --> 03:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
from us
 
03:43:39.469 --> 03:43:39.479 align:start position:0%
but the thing that makes it even more
 
03:43:42.469 --> 03:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
challenging is that the existing CRF
 
03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
calculation that compares our price
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
against the day ahead Market
 
03:43:49.309 --> 03:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
would remain the same even if our power
 
03:43:52.729 --> 03:43:52.739 align:start position:0%
was transacted at a higher value so for
 
03:43:54.889 --> 03:43:54.899 align:start position:0%
example right now our cost of energy is
 
03:43:56.510 --> 03:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
substantially less than default Service
 
03:43:56.520 --> 03:43:57.769 align:start position:0%
substantially less than default Service
pricing

03:43:57.769 --> 03:43:57.779 align:start position:0%
pricing
 
03:44:00.349 --> 03:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
if it was possible to use our power as
 
03:44:02.450 --> 03:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
part of the default service mix and sell
 
03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
it instead of selling it at a loss into
 
03:44:06.650 --> 03:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
the day ahead market then that would
 
03:44:09.170 --> 03:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
have significant rate payer benefits but
 
03:44:11.929 --> 03:44:11.939 align:start position:0%
even so the CRF would still track the
 
03:44:14.269 --> 03:44:14.279 align:start position:0%
difference the same way against the day
 
03:44:16.490 --> 03:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
ahead Market which continues to put us
 
03:44:19.550 --> 03:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
at risk so it makes us responsible for
 
03:44:21.530 --> 03:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
repaying a debt that was never actually
 
03:44:23.750 --> 03:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
incurred and it puts the plant's
 
03:44:26.330 --> 03:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
operation in Jeopardy for no really for
 
03:44:27.469 --> 03:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
no reason
 
03:44:29.990 --> 03:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
so we are asking for your help to
 
03:44:32.510 --> 03:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
resolve the CRF issue in order to
 
03:44:34.910 --> 03:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
provide long-term certainty for the for
 
03:44:36.170 --> 03:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
the plant
 
03:44:38.150 --> 03:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
um the lifespan of the facility extends
 
03:44:40.429 --> 03:44:40.439 align:start position:0%
well beyond the PPA term
 
03:44:42.830 --> 03:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and what's especially important to us
 
03:44:44.809 --> 03:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
in terms of providing certainty is it
 
03:44:47.690 --> 03:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
gives us the opportunity to pursue some
 
03:44:50.269 --> 03:44:50.279 align:start position:0%
co-location Partners so the the site the
 
03:44:53.090 --> 03:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
the facility sits on 60 Acres we have
 
03:44:54.950 --> 03:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
sought these opportunities to further
 
03:44:56.750 --> 03:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
develop the site
 
03:44:58.670 --> 03:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
um and and we have struggled to find
 
03:45:00.830 --> 03:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
Partners to do so because as soon as
 
03:45:02.330 --> 03:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
they realize that there is some sort of
 
03:45:04.969 --> 03:45:04.979 align:start position:0%
mechanism that provides uncertainty as
 
03:45:06.229 --> 03:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
to whether or not we are going to
 
03:45:08.330 --> 03:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
continue to operate they are not willing
 
03:45:11.630 --> 03:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
to invest in in locating alongside us
 
03:45:13.849 --> 03:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
um for example we have recently been
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
approached by a company who is
 
03:45:17.389 --> 03:45:17.399 align:start position:0%
interested in in pursuing a biochar
 
03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
facility alongside our operation and I
 
03:45:21.410 --> 03:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
think one thing that is particularly
 
03:45:24.050 --> 03:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
exciting about that is it gives us the
 
03:45:25.969 --> 03:45:25.979 align:start position:0%
opportunity to really use some symbiotic
 
03:45:27.530 --> 03:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
shared infrastructure so some of the
 
03:45:30.110 --> 03:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
good handling infrastructure those kinds
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
of things it would also be a company
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
that could bring an additional 300 000
 
03:45:37.250 --> 03:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
tons of capacity to the low-grade wood
 
03:45:39.469 --> 03:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
Market at a time when that industry is
 
03:45:41.330 --> 03:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
is struggling
 
03:45:43.849 --> 03:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
um but but like any of the others this
 
03:45:45.229 --> 03:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
type of project will not move forward
 
03:45:47.090 --> 03:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
unless we have some certainty around our
 
03:45:48.710 --> 03:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
future operations
 
03:45:51.710 --> 03:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
so I will stop there
 
03:45:53.450 --> 03:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate that these are
 
03:45:56.210 --> 03:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
complicated issues uh I appreciate your
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
willingness to dig into them we believe
 
03:46:00.349 --> 03:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
that Burgess is an important resource
 
03:46:01.969 --> 03:46:01.979 align:start position:0%
and that it should be protected as part
 
03:46:04.030 --> 03:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's energy generation mix
 
03:46:06.469 --> 03:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
and we are asking for your help in doing
 
03:46:08.929 --> 03:46:08.939 align:start position:0%
that so with that said I will stop
 
03:46:11.090 --> 03:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
talking and I will take questions
 
03:46:13.370 --> 03:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you excuse me thank you we
 
03:46:15.170 --> 03:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here and giving us
 
03:46:16.849 --> 03:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
your perspective
 
03:46:19.010 --> 03:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
we have questions from the members of
 
03:46:22.729 --> 03:46:22.739 align:start position:0%
the committee for Ms Boone
 
03:46:25.370 --> 03:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you you've taken my
 
03:46:28.309 --> 03:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
question you know we've heard all this
 
03:46:29.929 --> 03:46:29.939 align:start position:0%
stuff about how it helps out this and
 
03:46:31.969 --> 03:46:31.979 align:start position:0%
helps out that but the fact it remains
 
03:46:34.969 --> 03:46:34.979 align:start position:0%
that Burgess actively pursued a contract
 
03:46:37.910 --> 03:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
with Public Service as a condition for
 
03:46:39.889 --> 03:46:39.899 align:start position:0%
building their plan without that PPA you
 
03:46:41.870 --> 03:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
would have never gotten financing and
 
03:46:43.610 --> 03:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
now I haven't heard you present any
 
03:46:46.490 --> 03:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
alternative than what you just want to
 
03:46:48.410 --> 03:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
not have to pay the money back that you
 
03:46:50.690 --> 03:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
will to a contract you agreed to would
 
03:46:53.090 --> 03:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
you want us to sign a bill that says the
 
03:46:55.010 --> 03:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
contract's invalid and we'll continue to
 
03:46:57.229 --> 03:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
subsidize Burgess I haven't heard you
 
03:46:58.910 --> 03:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
come up with anything other than please
 
03:47:01.250 --> 03:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
help but you did willingly sign a
 
03:47:02.809 --> 03:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
contract and the bottom line is you
 
03:47:04.010 --> 03:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
don't want to live up to the terms of
 
03:47:08.710 --> 03:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:11.210 --> 03:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to note that the
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
PPA was signed and and negotiated at a
 
03:47:16.190 --> 03:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
time when eversource was still
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
generating its own power and when
 
03:47:21.410 --> 03:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
divestiture occurred it changed the
 
03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
terms of the contract itself and of uh
 
03:47:27.889 --> 03:47:27.899 align:start position:0%
the nature by which the the market is
 
03:47:29.830 --> 03:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
working and we are asking for your help
 
03:47:33.769 --> 03:47:33.779 align:start position:0%
in helping us to navigate that change in
 
03:47:33.779 --> 03:47:34.670 align:start position:0%
in helping us to navigate that change in
terms

03:47:34.670 --> 03:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
terms
 
03:47:36.170 --> 03:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah when you say asking for
 
03:47:40.490 --> 03:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
help what's your proposal what is it
 
03:47:44.809 --> 03:47:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:44.819 --> 03:47:46.429 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:47:49.729 --> 03:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:52.490 --> 03:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
we had been discussing an amendment to
 
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
this bill that is not being presented
 
03:47:57.349 --> 03:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
today and that Amendment did lay out
 
03:47:59.269 --> 03:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
some things that we had requested for
 
03:47:59.279 --> 03:48:00.309 align:start position:0%
some things that we had requested for
support

03:48:00.309 --> 03:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:48:04.190 --> 03:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
we certainly support the
 
03:48:05.510 --> 03:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
um the amendment that representative
 
03:48:08.210 --> 03:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
Vose has brought forth in forgiving the
 
03:48:11.090 --> 03:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
accrual uh the accrued amount resulting
 
03:48:16.670 --> 03:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:19.250 --> 03:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:48:21.650 --> 03:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has one thank you
 
03:48:23.090 --> 03:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:48:26.510 --> 03:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
question going forward is there a path
 
03:48:28.849 --> 03:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
for this plant to actually be cost
 
03:48:28.859 --> 03:48:29.870 align:start position:0%
for this plant to actually be cost
effective

03:48:29.870 --> 03:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
effective
 
03:48:32.150 --> 03:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
I think if you look at the cost as they
 
03:48:34.250 --> 03:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
are currently our plant is quite cost
 
03:48:37.190 --> 03:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
effective we are significantly less than
 
03:48:39.290 --> 03:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
default Service pricing right now but I
 
03:48:41.630 --> 03:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
think the the biggest challenge that we
 
03:48:43.729 --> 03:48:43.739 align:start position:0%
face is as I said we don't have any
 
03:48:45.530 --> 03:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
control over our power once it is
 
03:48:48.590 --> 03:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
purchased from us but we are responsible
 
03:48:49.969 --> 03:48:49.979 align:start position:0%
essentially for the difference in
 
03:48:54.290 --> 03:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:57.710 --> 03:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:00.410 --> 03:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Ms Boone for being
 
03:49:00.420 --> 03:49:01.309 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Ms Boone for being
here

03:49:01.309 --> 03:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call next on Paul Grenier
 
03:49:06.410 --> 03:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
the mayor of Berlin to get his comments
 
03:49:08.630 --> 03:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
and perspective on this issue I'll
 
03:49:10.309 --> 03:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
remind everyone that we're going to have
 
03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
a hard stop at one o'clock
 
03:49:17.389 --> 03:49:17.399 align:start position:0%
so that gives us about 13 minutes uh
 
03:49:20.330 --> 03:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
more then we'll have to recess this
 
03:49:22.790 --> 03:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
hearing until Monday
 
03:49:24.830 --> 03:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
03:49:27.889 --> 03:49:27.899 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Paul Grenier and I
 
03:49:30.349 --> 03:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
serve as the mayor of the city of Berlin
 
03:49:33.790 --> 03:49:33.800 align:start position:0%
I began my first term in January 2010
 
03:49:36.889 --> 03:49:36.899 align:start position:0%
largely because of my support for the
 
03:49:40.790 --> 03:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
Burgess biomass project in 2006 Frazier
 
03:49:43.190 --> 03:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
Paper Company shuttered the pulp Mill
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
located in the middle of Berlin
 
03:49:47.889 --> 03:49:47.899 align:start position:0%
eliminating over 375
 
03:49:50.090 --> 03:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and maintenance jobs and
 
03:49:53.030 --> 03:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
sending an economic shock to our city
 
03:49:55.510 --> 03:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
that no one could truly prepare for
 
03:49:57.889 --> 03:49:57.899 align:start position:0%
unemployment in the Berlin area was over
 
03:49:59.170 --> 03:49:59.180 align:start position:0%
10 percent
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
hard-working bright young families were
 
03:50:03.950 --> 03:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
leaving in a tax base the pulp Mill
 
03:50:07.250 --> 03:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
represented evaporated overnight
 
03:50:10.210 --> 03:50:10.220 align:start position:0%
to make an already difficult situation
 
03:50:12.550 --> 03:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
even more dire
 
03:50:15.110 --> 03:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
Decades of Legacy environmental
 
03:50:19.250 --> 03:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
degradation made on 120 Acre Site in the
 
03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
center of our city made a virtually
 
03:50:23.870 --> 03:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
impossible to redevelop
 
03:50:26.809 --> 03:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
faced with such a massive headwind many
 
03:50:29.330 --> 03:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
folks just plainly gave up
 
03:50:31.849 --> 03:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
while the site was being dismantled for
 
03:50:34.010 --> 03:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
scrap a handful of citizens began
 
03:50:36.469 --> 03:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
conversations with then New Hampshire
 
03:50:39.410 --> 03:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
State dread commissioner George bald on
 
03:50:41.510 --> 03:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
how to best utilize the site
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
the previous pulp Mill owner installed a
 
03:50:46.969 --> 03:50:46.979 align:start position:0%
new black liquor boiler in 1994 and was
 
03:50:50.450 --> 03:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
at the time state of the art that boiler
 
03:50:52.010 --> 03:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
was the centerpiece of the Burgess
 
03:50:55.130 --> 03:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
biopower plant Redevelopment project and
 
03:50:56.690 --> 03:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
after almost three years of working
 
03:50:58.790 --> 03:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
through tough financing and state
 
03:51:01.729 --> 03:51:01.739 align:start position:0%
permitting issues construction began in
 
03:51:01.739 --> 03:51:04.370 align:start position:0%
permitting issues construction began in
2011.

03:51:04.370 --> 03:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
2011.
 
03:51:07.490 --> 03:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
at that time Burgess biopower was the
 
03:51:10.010 --> 03:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
only entity to show even the slightest
 
03:51:13.130 --> 03:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
of interest in setting up shop in Berlin
 
03:51:15.769 --> 03:51:15.779 align:start position:0%
Burgess made Believers out of our
 
03:51:18.410 --> 03:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
community the remaining folks who hadn't
 
03:51:20.210 --> 03:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
left had a skip in their step that
 
03:51:23.570 --> 03:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
wasn't witness for some time and most of
 
03:51:26.090 --> 03:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
all a sense of community Pride once
 
03:51:27.950 --> 03:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
again took hold
 
03:51:31.010 --> 03:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
Burgess biopower isn't the end-all and
 
03:51:33.889 --> 03:51:33.899 align:start position:0%
be-all for us but it was the Catalyst
 
03:51:36.050 --> 03:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
the first to kick in the door to
 
03:51:37.790 --> 03:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
reinvent Berlin
 
03:51:40.010 --> 03:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
although Berlin's Collective efforts at
 
03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
diversifying our economy is beginning to
 
03:51:44.929 --> 03:51:44.939 align:start position:0%
take shape it is a slow and tedious
 
03:51:48.769 --> 03:51:48.779 align:start position:0%

Burgess biopower Remains the straw that
 
03:51:58.849 --> 03:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
stirs Berlin's drink it is our largest
 
03:52:01.190 --> 03:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer as well as our largest
 
03:52:04.250 --> 03:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
water and sewer user customer they
 
03:52:06.050 --> 03:52:06.060 align:start position:0%
generate millions of dollars in the
 
03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
purchase of goods and services in Berlin
 
03:52:09.950 --> 03:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
and kohas County
 
03:52:12.650 --> 03:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
also with Burgess using just a portion
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
of their site there is room and
 
03:52:17.269 --> 03:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
available energy to attract new business
 
03:52:18.889 --> 03:52:18.899 align:start position:0%
to Berlin
 
03:52:21.410 --> 03:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
Berlin psychologically and financially
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
can illiford to lose burgers we've had a
 
03:52:28.910 --> 03:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
serious brain drain from 2006 to 2010.
 
03:52:31.910 --> 03:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
we just don't have the human capital to
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
survive another Exodus
 
03:52:36.650 --> 03:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
by all measures Burgess solidified our
 
03:52:39.290 --> 03:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
existence just when it was needed the
 
03:52:39.300 --> 03:52:40.130 align:start position:0%
existence just when it was needed the
most

03:52:40.130 --> 03:52:40.140 align:start position:0%
most
 
03:52:42.530 --> 03:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
we are slowly making strides to expand
 
03:52:45.290 --> 03:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
our economy and Burgess will play a huge
 
03:52:47.330 --> 03:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
pipe in Berlin's future
 
03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:49.800 align:start position:0%

well we actually the
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know what type of oversight we

would you would be looking at for us to
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on a private business

I can tell you from not only an elected
 
03:53:50.750 --> 03:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
servant of the community but as a
 
03:53:55.610 --> 03:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
citizen Burgess biopower their senior
 
03:53:57.229 --> 03:53:57.239 align:start position:0%

citizens

03:54:10.550 --> 03:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
03:54:12.950 --> 03:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
every Community should be blessed with
 
03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
having us a a corporate partner of this
 
03:54:18.889 --> 03:54:18.899 align:start position:0%
magnitude in their community and
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
remember they're redeveloping
 
03:54:24.410 --> 03:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
the center of commute of the city
 
03:54:26.809 --> 03:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
which has for over a hundred years been
 
03:54:28.370 --> 03:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
part of the pulp and paper making
 
03:54:31.130 --> 03:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
process including I might add a
 
03:54:34.010 --> 03:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
five-acre uh parcel right in the middle
 
03:54:36.830 --> 03:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
of that site that's a Mercury
 
03:54:39.830 --> 03:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
contamination site
 
03:54:42.889 --> 03:54:42.899 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up no I I understand
 
03:54:45.590 --> 03:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're awesome I can probably
 
03:54:47.870 --> 03:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
agree with you on that but will the city
 
03:54:51.170 --> 03:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
be involved in any kind of oversight to
 
03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
make sure they don't sort of get into
 
03:54:55.130 --> 03:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
the same rut that they that are the same
 
03:54:56.990 --> 03:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
problem that they're in right now well
 
03:55:02.269 --> 03:55:02.279 align:start position:0%
what I what we are investigating is uh
 
03:55:02.279 --> 03:55:04.030 align:start position:0%
what I what we are investigating is uh
communities

03:55:04.030 --> 03:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:55:07.550 --> 03:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh aggregating to purchase power
 
03:55:10.969 --> 03:55:10.979 align:start position:0%
and when I see myself I'm a default
 
03:55:13.610 --> 03:55:13.620 align:start position:0%
customer of eversource just so I can
 
03:55:15.410 --> 03:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
gauge and watch
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
how I'm paying 22 cents for power
 
03:55:21.110 --> 03:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
there may be a pretty significant
 
03:55:23.030 --> 03:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us
 
03:55:25.969 --> 03:55:25.979 align:start position:0%
to purchase power in a different way
 
03:55:30.050 --> 03:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
which would increase burgess's synergy
 
03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.189 --> 03:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you I think I think burgess's
 
03:55:39.889 --> 03:55:39.899 align:start position:0%
opportunities are Limitless
 
03:55:42.769 --> 03:55:42.779 align:start position:0%
if you can unshackle the fact that
 
03:55:44.269 --> 03:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
they're paying they're getting paid
 
03:55:46.910 --> 03:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
eight cents in the marketplace when the
 
03:55:49.250 --> 03:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
marketplace is generating 22 cents and
 
03:55:51.349 --> 03:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
eversource tells the puc in the public
 
03:55:54.830 --> 03:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
that at 22 cents it's a pass-through
 
03:55:56.689 --> 03:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
I'm not the smartest guy in the world
 
03:56:00.170 --> 03:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
but I I do the math and from eight cents
 
03:56:03.590 --> 03:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
that they're paying uh Burgess and 22
 
03:56:04.910 --> 03:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
cents that they're collecting from the
 
03:56:06.889 --> 03:56:06.899 align:start position:0%
rate payers there seems to be an
 
03:56:09.889 --> 03:56:09.899 align:start position:0%
opportunity in my mind where we can come
 
03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:19.849 --> 03:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:23.150 --> 03:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
I would just like to Echo the
 
03:56:28.610 --> 03:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:31.490 --> 03:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
the staff at Burgess biopower I've had a
 
03:56:34.429 --> 03:56:34.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work with the staff there
 
03:56:37.130 --> 03:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
this particularly the senior senior
 
03:56:40.729 --> 03:56:40.739 align:start position:0%
staff over the last nine months and I
 
03:56:45.530 --> 03:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
find them to be of the
 
03:56:50.330 --> 03:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
the top-notch quality in terms of of the
 
03:56:53.689 --> 03:56:53.699 align:start position:0%
staff of of the plant and uh it's been a
 
03:56:55.250 --> 03:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
pleasure to work with them
 
03:56:57.590 --> 03:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
and uh I'll look forward to working with
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
them again in the future I hope
 
03:57:03.229 --> 03:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
so thank you mayor Mr chairman as as an
 
03:57:04.969 --> 03:57:04.979 align:start position:0%

03:57:13.729 --> 03:57:13.739 align:start position:0%

03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:16.080 align:start position:0%

03:57:25.429 --> 03:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
we only have four more people who want
 
03:57:28.010 --> 03:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
to testify on their all local to Concord
 
03:57:31.729 --> 03:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
so nobody will be forced to drive from
 
03:57:34.849 --> 03:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
Berlin to uh to testify
 
03:57:39.229 --> 03:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
