get started on uh House Bill 194 and
 
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize the sponsor
 
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:15.470 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize the sponsor
representative

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
ger thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
the committee uh so uh you know my idea
 
00:09:23.949 --> 00:09:23.959 align:start position:0%
thinking about also working with a lot
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
of Educators in chesher County over the
 
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
years and and seeing a lot of the great
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
work they do particularly for National
 
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
History day uh I thought it would be
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
really great if there was just one place
 
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
uh on a State website that that you
 
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
could go and you could see the list of
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
all of the public monuments in the state
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to go visit all of the war
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
memorials for example in the state they
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
would all be listed there you could see
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
where they were uh and so that was just
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
the impetus for the bill is the way that
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
we use monuments for Education right and
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
if if we want young people in New
 
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to really feel rooted and
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
grounded in the state uh and to
 
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate the rich uh history and the
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
cultures of the state to stay here or to
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
come back here after college uh this is
 
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
obviously an issue that we have for the
 
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
state in terms of a lot of young people
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
who go out of state for school and
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately don't come back I think if
 
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
they feel rooted in the history and and
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
the cultures of our state I think that
 
00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
that would help them see New Hampshire
 
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
as a place that where they do want to be
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
in the long run and raise their
 
00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
families so I submitted the bill I was a
 
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
newbie I had been elected but I had uh
 
00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
not been seated you know when I
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
submitted this bill in the first place
 
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
and I sent it to the wrong Department uh
 
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
I am as you said a historian so I think
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
about archives you archive things you
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
know you archive whatever so I had to go
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
to the archives that was the wrong place
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh and uh they don't have a position
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
where somebody would would do that work
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh and so then I worked with director
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
Wilson who will be speaking after me at
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
the division of historical resources to
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
amend the bill to make sure number one
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
it was going to the right place and
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
number two so that the amendment was
 
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
written specifically in a way that would
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
allow the division to do the work
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
without additional resources that it
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
fits within the resources that they
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
currently have so the amendment was
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
written as I said specifically with the
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
director to uh serve those purposes
 
00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
right so what it would be is a very
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
simple uh list the kind of qualifying uh
 
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
important qualifying phrase in the bill
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
itself is that it is a list of publicly
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
maintained monuments there was kind of a
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
question of well what's a monument and
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
then that can get a little sticky in
 
00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
this case it is publicly maintained and
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
what that means is that every town right
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
has a list of The Monuments it maintains
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
so this is a finite list of objects in
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
the state so uh the division as director
 
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
Wilson will testify can reach out to
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
localities they will send in the
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
information and it will all be put on a
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
list that is then put up uh for for
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
anyone in the state to to access uh and
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know I could dream about someday
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
maybe we could we could find some uh
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
grant money from the ne or some other
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
source that would allow us to kind of
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
build it out as an educational tool but
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
I think this is an important step as you
 
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
said for teachers for students and also
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
for anybody uh in the state who wants to
 
00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:24.519 align:start position:0%
be able to visit something like all of
 
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:26.839 align:start position:0%
our war memorials there's one place
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
where you could find all of that
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
information so
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
that is a a really quick overview as I
 
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
said the director will testify to the
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
ability of the division to perform the
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
work without any additional
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
resources all right thank you
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative does the committee have
 
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.710 align:start position:0%
representative does the committee have
any

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
questions no well I'll ask one why
 
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.389 align:start position:0%
questions no well I'll ask one why
not

00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
um do you see this list as just a a a
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
Bare Bones kind of spreadsheet kind of
 
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
list you know the name of the thing the
 
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
place where it is is maybe the year it
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
was created or something like that um or
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
is this going to be more of a an more
 
00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:10.519 align:start position:0%
interesting website that has photos and
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
the descriptions and stuff like
 
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question to begin
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
with it'll be a very Bare Bones uh list
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
again the purpose was to to have it be
 
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
something that the department division
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
can do without additional resources and
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
the and the director could speak to what
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
exactly that involves my understanding
 
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
is it's just a straightforward list uh
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
and I do want to also add which I should
 
00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
have in my introductory remarks that uh
 
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:37.959 align:start position:0%
the reason why it is a bill is because
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
to in order to have the division update
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
the list every 10 years as the Director
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
will testify that has to be in statute
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh so that is the part of the bill that
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
requires a change to the statute but as
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
as far as I understand it it will begin
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
as a pretty straightforward list without
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
many bells or
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
whistles thank you any other questions
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative grass I I just have a
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
brief comment would you believe that uh
 
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
one of the towns I worked with we
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
actually did this with some of our
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
historic structures in the community
 
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:09.759 align:start position:0%
it's part of our master plan we went out
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
and actually Geo referenced the location
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
and then tagged photos to it and we the
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
Geo referencing was actually done by um
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
um Eagle Scout um that went out and
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
actually did that work we'd assign him
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
to a neighborhood and go out and you
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
know just go down the street and every
 
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
time you come to one of these address is
 
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
just hit the button and it worked out
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
reasonably well I would have no trouble
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
believing that at
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
all thank you representative so do we
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
need to do the pink card thing would

the state maintains monuments for
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
instance out on the State House lawn so
 
00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:54.519 align:start position:0%

their local dpws to to maintain and uh
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
um so much like having a u a local
 
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
circuit Rider Eagle Scout um do that
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
work um we wouldn't have to employ
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
anybody to go out and physically um find
 
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
these locations because they are they
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
are maintained publicly maintained and
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't expand beyond that unless
 
00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:28.759 align:start position:0%
there was actual funding um to make make
 
00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:30.910 align:start position:0%
there was actual funding um to make make
that

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
happen so I'm happy to answer questions
 
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.430 align:start position:0%
happen so I'm happy to answer questions
any

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative people
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so just to just to sort of
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
restate the situation the bill was um
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
introduced to require the creation of
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
this listing it has a fiscal note
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
of couple hundred, doll give or take but
 
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
you're saying now that that money isn't
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
needed to put the this bill into action
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
if it passes that's correct so when the
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
bill was originally assigned to the
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office um they
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
don't employ people that you know do
 
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
these kinds of things um our division we
 
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
have multiple lists dozens of lists of
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
national register uh locations state
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
Register locations historic Highway
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
markers you name it um and they're
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
simple lists they're not they're not U
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
they don't have long descriptions in
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
some case no photos and that sort of
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
thing so naturally the Secretary of
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
State's office put in a fiscal note of I
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
think it was 117,000 or somewhere around
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
around that and that makes sense because
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
they were going to have to hire and pay
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
benefits to somebody over the course of
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
a year or two um we won't have to do
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
that um as amended we don't see any
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
Department thank you um how about to put
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%

Linn from Windam and when you say I'm
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
give you the history I'm I'm I'm not
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
sure I have enough time to do that and
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure frankly that I
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
intelligently could do that anymore
 
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
because there have been so many changes
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh that have happened and I I mean I
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
really I I I have to extend you know
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
hearty congratulations to Chairman Roy
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
from Criminal Justice for being able to
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
get everybody together to get um to get
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
the bail reform sort of uh through uh on
 
00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:23.799 align:start position:0%
a policy level the only thing that I um
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
uh raise a a question about is is simply
 
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
from a purely
 
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
Financial perspective um is there I hope
 
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
that this committee will look carefully
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
at whether there is really a
 
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
need for 15
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
magistrates while you're also going to
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
have all of the bail Commissioners I
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
mean one of one of the things that I
 
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
remember way back when this first
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
started was there was some
 
00:29:59.509 --> 00:29:59.519 align:start position:0%
discussion um uh about whether there
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
should be whether uh the the uh judicial
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
branch should hire magist should should
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
they be uh approved to hire magistrates
 
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:12.519 align:start position:0%
which who would have sort of limited
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
responsibilities or should there simply
 
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:17.559 align:start position:0%
be an increase in the number of Judges
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
who would be able to have you know would
 
00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:21.519 align:start position:0%
be able to do everything so to speak
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
within the within the uh uh the realm of
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch um my personal sense
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
was it made more sense to hire judges
 
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
but I can completely understand that you
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
know there's a good argument on the
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
other side to to hire magistrates
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
instead but the one point that I would
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
make is at at the time that that was
 
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
originally discussed the idea I believe
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh then there was the talk was at the
 
00:30:52.509 --> 00:30:52.519 align:start position:0%
time of 15 magistrates uh but the idea
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
at least at at that time was that the
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
magistrates would replace the bail Comm
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as I understand it now the
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
magistrates would there would be 15
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
magistrates but the bail Commissioners
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
would also remain um and so I my only
 
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
question is it you
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
know unless things have changed really
 
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
really dramatically and I'm willing to
 
00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039 align:start position:0%
I'm assumed in the four years since I've
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
left the judicial branch I'm sure there
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
have been changes I don't have any doubt
 
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
about that particularly I left before Co
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure there have been changes but
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
I have to say I have to say that I do
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
question the idea of the need for 15
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
magistrates right now while you also
 
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
have you know keep all the bail
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioners if the thought was that
 
00:31:44.909 --> 00:31:44.919 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners as they retire or
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
something will not be replaced or will
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
be replaced with magistrates that might
 
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
make perfect sense to do that but I just
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
ask I just asked this committee to look
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
carefully at the at the money part of
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
this uh and other than that I as I say I
 
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
commend chairman Roy for his efforts and
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
been able to get this together I it
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
seems like um uh you know on balance
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
this is a really good compromise was
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
able to get everyone together and I uh
 
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
very much support the
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
bill and other than that I'm happy to
 
00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:17.149 align:start position:0%
bill and other than that I'm happy to
take

00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
questions as a good representative knows
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
we try to state of financial matters but
 
00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:24.519 align:start position:0%
this is kind of an unruly Bunch so we
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
often Venture into I do remember from my
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
my one term on finance yes I remember we
 
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:32.919 align:start position:0%
learned all our lessons from
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
representative Smith who was sitting in
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
the back
 
00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:40.190 align:start position:0%
the back
[Laughter]

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
there anywhere there questions for the
 
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:44.919 align:start position:0%
good representative yes representative
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I mentioned
 
00:32:51.149 --> 00:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
this earlier to you but I want to do it
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
in session um we have three bills that
 
00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
all seem to be on the same sort of topic
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
of bail and what happens to people
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
between arrest and trial that's this
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
bill the one that follows Senate Bill
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
252 and there's also Senate Bill 249
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
which also mentions magistrates would it
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
make sense to to combine all these
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
things into one sort of comprehensive
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
bill so that so that the governor can
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
see a a full plan or is this more of a a
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
Chinese menu kind of situation where
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
where you could take all three or some
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
two or some one and it would all you
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
know it would be they're all
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
independent you know I I would defer to
 
00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
Chairman Roy on this because I I um I
 
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
have an interest in this area but I'm
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
not on the criminal justice committee
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
and I know they have really shephered
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
this um just as a you know for as a from
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
a from a practical standpoint I would
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
say that if unless there are other
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
considerations it would seem to me that
 
00:33:57.549 --> 00:33:57.559 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to give the governor
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
one bill but maybe there are other
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
considerations and that's something that
 
00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Roy I think could address
 
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I'll ask him the
 
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:05.950 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I'll ask him the
same

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
question further
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.109 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
you

00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:28.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
committee I'm here today to discuss the
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh two bail bills you have in front of
 
00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
you um I guess I'll start by addressing
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns we just heard with
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
because they're probably the most
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
expensive piece is the magistrate system
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
the magistrate system it it I can
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
understand um the former Chief Justice's
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
concerns with u regard to what he saw
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
when he was there in the need firm
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
there's a couple is issues one is the
 
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
magistrates are doing more than just
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
bail they are going to be doing certain
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
ministerial duties that will free up
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court Justices by holding
 
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
hearings and such as needed as dictated
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
by the Chief
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
Justice they are also the number 15 was
 
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
arrived at by you have one per County
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
their duties will be to and there's five
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
extras to cover
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
vacations and other workload type
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
issues their duties will be to supervise
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
all the bail clerks excuse me bail
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioners within their counties to
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are trained per the
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
statute that we have put in that was one
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
of the main concerns we he heard that
 
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
they weren't getting the proper training
 
00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.510 align:start position:0%
they weren't getting the proper training
they

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
needed um they are to ensure that they
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
are properly staffed and coveraged
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
because we heard from the jails in the
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
prison that often times they could wait
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
8 n hours to get a bail commissioner
 
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
they would go through the list and then
 
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
start through the list again and people
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
would sit there and wait to get out of
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
jail because there weren't bail
 
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners we had bail Commissioners
 
00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
who just resigned and sent an email to
 
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
somebody nobody knew they were gone um
 
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
so the it was kind of chaos is what we
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
heard in the realm of bail
 
00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners so there's another issue
 
00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
with regard to bail Commissioners as
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
well with regard to their status no
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
one's quite sure if they're employees or
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
if they're not not the court treats them
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
as sort of
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
contractors but if you read the IRS
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
rules they
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
are they dictate their place of
 
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
employment their time of employment and
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
how much money they get that kind of
 
00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:45.079 align:start position:0%
sounds like an employee to the IRS so
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
the court right now is juggling and
 
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with what they're going to do
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
about that so if they are faced with
 
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
having to phase out Bail Commissioners
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
they'll be in a world of hurt if they
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
don't have somebody there
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
so that's that's another look at that so
 
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
the the magistrates are there to cover a
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
wide range of things also in the statute
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
that we just
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
wrote the at the suggestion of the
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
Senate and we concurred there are
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
certain very serious crimes that we are
 
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
not going to allow bail Commissioners to
 
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
rule on those will have to be a
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
magistrate or a
 
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
judge we also said that someone can't be
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
held more than 24 hours with without
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
somebody ruling on their bail ability
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
well that means somebody has to work on
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
a weekend that will be the job of the
 
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
magistrates we conferred with the court
 
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.599 align:start position:0%
over several meetings they didn't feel
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
it would be logistically possible to
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
have a judge do it because they would
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
have to open the court to do that and to
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
do that to open the court you have to
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
have a clerk and you have to have other
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
employees who are members of a union so
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
now you have to impact bargain their
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
contract and it becomes a very expensive
 
00:37:55.839 --> 00:37:57.430 align:start position:0%
contract and it becomes a very expensive
Quagmire

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
Quagmire
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
with the what we figured out is with the
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
magistrates they can conduct these
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
remotely they are highly trained um and
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
they will be hearing the more serious
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
crimes over the weekend so I think I've
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
laid out pretty much what the
 
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
magistrates are going to do in a
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
justification for the number in their
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
job um and with that I'm happy to take
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions because there's so
 
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
much in the bill I could spend an hour
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
going over I'd like to also add I
 
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate um representative Lynn giving
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
me credit crit for this but I want to
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
make it clear I couldn't have done it
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
without my Democratic colleagues um
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative here Gite representative
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
Muse were key to making sure this all
 
00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.309 align:start position:0%
Muse were key to making sure this all
came

00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
together represent Maguire thank you Mr
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for coming um so if
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
we look at our fiscal note it it's looks
 
00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
like about a
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
3.16 million ongoing cost and my
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
understanding of magistrates would be
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
about 2 million or so of that do you
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
know what the other million is is being
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
used for well this goes to your question
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
about combining bills so if the one if
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note is on the bill that has
 
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners getting paid that
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
could be the other one mon million-ish
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
um what we discovered was the where the
 
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
currently the statute is that whoever
 
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
gets bailed has to pay the bail
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner when they pay him who knows
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
it's not enforced so we had bail
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner is telling us about 40% of
 
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
the time they don't get paid at all we
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
had one bail commissioner come and
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
testify he was owed
 
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
$52,000 in over a two-year period from
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
bails he had done he gets called out at
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
3: in the morning goes out bails
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
somebody out he doesn't get paid for it
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
40% of the time it's a
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
freebie that's not how should we be we
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
should be treating people who do this
 
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
key service for us because if the bail
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
Commissioners all quit tomorrow our
 
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system will come to a
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
screeching halt so what we came up with
 
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
was okay the court is going to pay the
 
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners their fee and the
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
court can recover the money from the
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
defendant the way it is now the bail
 
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner if he really wanted to get
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
paid would actually have to sue a
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
defendant to get his money and you know
 
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
the CH it would cost them money to
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
actually prosecute that case so with the
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
Court's ability to order fines and
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
payments they are well better placed to
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
recoup that money than the bail
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners were so in the bill we put
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
the power for the court and they're
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
allowed to give up to a year to pay the
 
00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:32.349 align:start position:0%
allowed to give up to a year to pay the
money

00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
$50 you don't have it right now that's
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
fine you've got a whole year to pass as
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
long as they get it back into the
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
coffers and it goes back into their
 
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
money hopefully that will offset a large
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
portion of that extra $2
 
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
million further question thank you so uh
 
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
when you say that they're not getting
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
paid they're not getting paid the $40 is
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
that is that that's all they do get paid
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's it okay got yeah they have
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
no salary or stip in anything can you
 
00:41:04.109 --> 00:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
give us any um statistics in general how
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
many bail Commissioners are there how
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
many cases do they deal with you know
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
roughly I can I can give you first we
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
can talk about the bail
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners currently we think there's
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
about a hundred the fact that I have to
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
say think is indicative of a problem um
 
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
no one knows for sure hence we need this
 
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.790 align:start position:0%
no one knows for sure hence we need this
supervisory

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
supervisory
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
the judges are supposed to do it if
 
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
you've seen their court case loads they
 
00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
just don't have time it's this is such a
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
a ministerial type of thing um so no
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
one's really sure how many we guess
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
about a 100 that give or take um their
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
cases I can't really say they're they're
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
they're you know they deal with every
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
single arrest so we're looking in the
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
thousands uh per year so it's it's quite
 
00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
significant every single person who's
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
arrested in Hampshire unless it's a a
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
warrant that says no bail is entitled to
 
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
bail and the vast vast majority are
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
entitled to bail so the bail
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
arrest so one more um you heard uh
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn um say that he
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
thinks 15 is too
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
many um and you yourself said that
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to do their work
 
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
online and certain um certain uh
 
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
counties are very small compared to
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
others right I've heard it said that all
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
of Coos is smaller than Portsmouth for
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
example right so um since it's online
 
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
could maybe one handle multiple counties
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
and therefore we don't need all 15 um
 
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I said it online if I
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
did I misspoke there's no mandate that
 
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
it be online they're just going to
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
handle them on the weekend so they may
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
very well have to go out to do it in
 
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
person um to look at the case File the
 
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
one of the problems we have in New
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I tried to address an in
 
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
this and it was a bridge too far is our
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
inter electronic Communication System
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
between the branches the judicial
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
executive as far as law enforcement goes
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
is horrific so bail Commissioners when
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
they go to do a bail they rely on the
 
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
police department to give them a printed
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
copy of a defendant's record so because
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's illegal to transmit it through
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
email so they kind of have to do go in
 
00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:25.559 align:start position:0%
person most of the time and the problem
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
is some of our to your point some of our
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
distant counties up there our friends
 
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
they don't even have a computer terminal
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
in their Police Department to print the
 
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
record so they have to go to a local
 
00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
County Jail they'll print the criminal
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
record then they'll bring it back to
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
show the bail commissioner so it gets
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
quite quite complicated whether or not
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
we could shave off one or two is open
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
for debate as far as how many um this
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
was the number that I was given we
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
looked at the justification we felt that
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
that that logistic wise not financially
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
but policy logistic wise it made sense
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
whether that ends up being too many in
 
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
the as but we all know that once a
 
00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
position's there the position's there so
 
00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:12.559 align:start position:0%
um I I would say
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
that it's possible that they don't need
 
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
50 and they may could get by with 12 um
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
but I I just I would hesitate to do it
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
and then have to come back at this again
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
and say we're short but that's
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
fortunately your decision to
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
make representative huitt did you have a
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
question yeah I am I'm on the other end
 
00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:38.630 align:start position:0%
question yeah I am I'm on the other end
of

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
this I was a district court judge for
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
quite a few years uh the
 
00:44:50.109 --> 00:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
the the features of this whole problem
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
involve money and they involve
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
politics so you haven't got a an easy
 
00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.710 align:start position:0%
politics so you haven't got a an easy
job

00:44:59.710 --> 00:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
um the theory is that bail Commissioners
 
00:45:07.549 --> 00:45:07.559 align:start position:0%
were created for the purpose of
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
facilitating uh compliance with the with
 
00:45:10.559 --> 00:45:11.990 align:start position:0%
facilitating uh compliance with the with
the

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:15.559 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh they were as a general
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
rule not very well educated in their job
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
although they they were they were
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
citizens who had a general working
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the government
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing um but getting them
 
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
out and working was a a difficult thing
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh I think I made a record one one year
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
of having issue set bail in the middle
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
of the night uh for somebody in
 
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:50.559 align:start position:0%
Keen about a dozen
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
times this isn't something that's going
 
00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.079 align:start position:0%
to end easily because number one as you
 
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
said uh the bail Commissioners are not
 
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
paid on a regular or
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
a a a basis which you can identify
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
because they have they collect from the
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
from the from the defendant well let's
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
face it uh a lot of the bail
 
00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:21.079 align:start position:0%
Commissioners do most of their business
 
00:46:21.079 --> 00:46:22.390 align:start position:0%
Commissioners do most of their business
at

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
night because in the daytime people can
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
go to the courthouse and they can go
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
know all kinds of things can be done but
 
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the night uh there are
 
00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of crimes committed in New
 
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and each one of those crimes
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
if the if the perpetrator is
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
caught and that sets off the bail
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner situation because the
 
00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:50.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution says how long you can hang
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
on to
 
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
them and that's something that's kind of
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:46:56.319 --> 00:46:57.390 align:start position:0%
you know
working

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:46:59.950 --> 00:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
along maybe some of them may get out a
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
longer than one would like sometimes in
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
terms of days and I've heard of a couple
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
of cases in terms of weeks that they got
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
got held before they could post bail and
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
that was perfectly logical because they
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
didn't have any money with which to post
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
bail if they couldn't post bail they
 
00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:22.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't get out
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
so and I I've watched this happen since
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
I've since I've happily
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
retired i' s watched this happen I talk
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
with I have a lot of friends who B
 
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh because I dealt with
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
all the bail Commissioners in bnna
 
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
County because Leon was the only place
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
that had a
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
court that could administer this sort of
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
thing and not all the courts have judges
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
who are interested in this stuff
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
either and it's a it's a difficult
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
situation but law is not an easy thing
 
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.710 align:start position:0%
situation but law is not an easy thing
to

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
understand and for somebody who's a you
 
00:48:10.109 --> 00:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
know auto mechanic or who's a a bank
 
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
teller or something in the middle of the
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
night to understand the complexities of
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
a say a a federal offense as opposed to
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
a state offense and all that stuff is
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
very difficult and I hope that the the
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
committee and I hope that the
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
legislature takes a long hard look at
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
this and doesn't fall in the Trap
 
00:48:34.079 --> 00:48:36.589 align:start position:0%
this and doesn't fall in the Trap
of

00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
funding more
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
more more small businesses within the
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
court system and within the state
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
because that's that's going to cost a
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%
lot of money
 
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
eventually and there's no need for it if
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
it's done
 
00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
right so so I wish you all the fck in
 
00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.430 align:start position:0%
right so so I wish you all the fck in
the

00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
world thank you cuz I sat with this and
 
00:49:03.789 --> 00:49:03.799 align:start position:0%
listened to people and listened to
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
listen to the fail Commissioners
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
complain and some of them run off of the
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
mouth for a long time about their their
 
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
sad situation and you couldn't sit there
 
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:17.799 align:start position:0%
and listen to it and not agree that's
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
the trouble you couldn't say I yeah full
 
00:49:19.359 --> 00:49:20.150 align:start position:0%
the trouble you couldn't say I yeah full
of

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
blone because they weren't full of blone
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
they were absolutely right we were WR
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
wrong and the people were wrong the most
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
were the local governments who refused
 
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
to participate in the funding of all of
 
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.270 align:start position:0%
to participate in the funding of all of
this

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.829 align:start position:0%
this
yeah

00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
so I wish you all the luck in the world
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of questions uh a
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
lot of questions that need to be
 
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
answered before you can get through it
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
yeah um to your to your point with
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
regard to the training uh or their their
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
experience to be able to make
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
discernments about um complicated issues
 
00:49:58.789 --> 00:49:58.799 align:start position:0%
regarding bail even to um questions
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
regarding you know fugitive from justice
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
warrants and things of this nature it's
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
very complex that's why we mandated
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
before they come on board they get 40
 
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
hours of training um and they get an
 
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
annual training on any updates in the
 
00:50:14.109 --> 00:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
law so the the days of you know here
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
here you go um go get them are gone the
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
they will be trained and that's another
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
reason that the magistrates had to have
 
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
um the position was classified as it was
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
they have to be educated they have to be
 
00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
educated in the law what we were
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about is you know a bunch of
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
retired police Chiefs looking to add to
 
00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:35.799 align:start position:0%
their retirement no we want hopefully
 
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys and so we needed a position
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
classified at that rank that would that
 
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
would support that kind of salary um so
 
00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
it it it is very key that we have
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
intelligent people making these
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
decisions not only to ensure defendants
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
um get their fair fair hearing but to
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
also make sure that we're not exposing
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
the state state to liability for
 
00:50:59.710 --> 00:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
lawsuits because bad decisions were made
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
night are further questions
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
representative wer followed by
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative evil thank
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr chairman the idea of having 15
 
00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
you talked about one per County and
 
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
obviously that so is this a job we show
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
up whenever the Court's in session
 
00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
rather than a bail commissioner that's
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
sitting at home unless he gets called oh
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
no this is a report for work job report
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
for work whenever the court is in
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
session and I would imagine the the you
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
know and I tried not to micromanage the
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
the the a judicial branch so but it's a
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
full-time job my my understanding is
 
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
they're looking at having them on a
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
rotating schedule so that you know some
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
will work weekends this week or for a
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
month and then the next one that type of
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
thing because that's why you need more
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
than just one per County because you
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
don't want one working every weekend all
 
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
year long so I believe that they're
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
going to look into rotating it and and
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
but it's a show up for work at your
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
office every every working day type of
 
00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
job so we start with Hillsboro having
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
two counties two County um courts anyway
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
yeah right so that that already brings
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
it to 11 yeah yeah thank you some like
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
you like the representative said some of
 
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
them you know that you go up there you
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
might have one that part-time but other
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
so yeah since um thank you for all your
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
work on this it's just been an
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
unbelievable process I know I just want
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure I have it right in the
 
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
notes so you said that um there's a
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
magistrate for every County plus five to
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
fill in for okay and then the number or
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
the recommended number you got from the
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
judicial branch are they the ones that
 
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
provided the yes they are um we what we
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
did is we looked at the we talked to the
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
judicial branch we talked to the the
 
00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
Attorney General the Chiefs of police
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
everybody in the jails and we looked at
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
you know how many cases how often are
 
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
they called how many weekend calls and
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
um we submitted that to the judicial
 
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
branch and say look what do you need to
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
be able to do this um and we they were
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
given two options would you need um to
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
open the courts on the weekends we
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
pursued that a little bit and we
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
realized that was not the road to go
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
down we went back and said okay let's
 
00:53:21.549 --> 00:53:21.559 align:start position:0%
look at the magistrates again we know
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
that that position was already floated
 
00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
several years ago in a concept of
 
00:53:27.789 --> 00:53:27.799 align:start position:0%
replacing bail Commissioners um that
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
bill didn't go anywhere at the time
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
because you cannot replace over a
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
hundred we should have about 130 bail
 
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners with 15 people um it's
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
just not feasible they it just wouldn't
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
happen um but you can augment them and
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
maybe limit the number shrink the number
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
of bail Commissioners eventually once
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
you have trained people in place but the
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
yeah the 15 we got from the court and
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
they based it on the coverage that they
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
would have to do and anticipating
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
vacations and a rotating shift so that
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to work every weekend
 
00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
cuz if you're arrested on Saturday you
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
have to get bailed on a Sunday so it's
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
not just Saturdays they have to work
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
Saturday Sundays if it's a if it's
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
Christmas if it's a holiday the those
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
magistrates have to be available because
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
no one can be held for more than 24
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
hours on that list of crimes so someone
 
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
has to be available 24/7 365 days a year
 
00:54:23.069 --> 00:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
State just ask a follow
 
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
um okay well I think that's really
 
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
important testimony because it sounds to
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
me like you did a massive amount of
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
research uh uh to to ultimately to give
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
to the judicial branch and for them to
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
come up with the number that's needed
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's not like something that just kind
 
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
of evolved yeah yeah this was definitely
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
not pulled out of pulled out of the air
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
type of thing I I gave them parameters
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
what I thought we needed and what I
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
would ask be asking of the judicial
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
branch and they said this is what we can
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
do and this is what we need whether or
 
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
not that ends up being you know a little
 
00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.470 align:start position:0%
not that ends up being you know a little
too

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
much you guys know better than I how how
 
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
how the branches request money and how
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
they cushion I mean do they assume
 
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to cut some anyway and ads
 
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm a policy guy you're
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
money so I don't I don't know I know the
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
policy is very sound um the cost I don't
 
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
know so I have just a couple of
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
questions so I served as a bail
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner in the Milford district
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
court for a number of years and at the
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
time the Local District Court Judge
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
appointed you and there was to a
 
00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
representative ht's comment I was
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
probably not well educated to take the
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
position but I see here it says uh 15
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
highly qualified magistrates what are
 
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
those qualifications do you know that
 
00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:52.039 align:start position:0%
makes them highly qualified yes we um
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
originally I I wanted to put in there
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
they had to be an attorney and another
 
00:55:59.789 --> 00:55:59.799 align:start position:0%
branch of government weigh in and said
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
um well if you do that it's going to
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
cause problems as far as if if we can't
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
fill the positions it doesn't let us
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
pick someone for example with a master's
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
degree or or someone with a significant
 
00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:11.799 align:start position:0%
experience so I said
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
well so the human resources people said
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
that it's better to classify the job at
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
a at a job classification level and then
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
the criteria are kind of built into
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
those so we're talking about people with
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
at least Advanced degrees is what I was
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
told um so it's not going to be you know
 
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
a retired police Sergeant um coming in
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
there unless he has degrees that would
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
that would actually qualify for him for
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
that step that they've qualified the
 
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
position at again this is kind of
 
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
something where I'm going to lean on you
 
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
to say I I I don't I don't really know
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
how the step systems work and the salary
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
systems work I I I would assume that you
 
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
guys are experts in that and you might
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
be a tell me yeah we'll try but uh with
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
the difficulty we're having finding
 
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:02.839 align:start position:0%
qualified people for anything exactly
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
was there any thought given to like is
 
00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:08.359 align:start position:0%
how soon would you get the 15 qualified
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
magistrates is it going to take a couple
 
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
of years or are there people lining up
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
at your door banging on it to say we're
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
qualified to do this new role well one
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
of the when I when I came out and said
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
listen I want these to be attorneys they
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
went well you realize we can't get
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
attorneys to fill our regular jobs right
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
now never mind someone who's going to
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
work on the weekends so um that's why
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
they said look you have to make it if
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
you limit us to just attorneys we may
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
not be able to fill these for years um
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
and we might never get the 15 they said
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
it's better to qualify it at a step that
 
00:57:45.549 --> 00:57:45.559 align:start position:0%
we could say this person has to be
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
qualified and educated but doesn't
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be a member of the
 
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
bar so that's what we agreed to as a
 
00:57:53.029 --> 00:57:53.039 align:start position:0%
compromise so they said it could take
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
about a year hopefully and and that's
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
another good point though when we say 15
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
they might never get 15 um they at the
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
salary it's paying even though it's good
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
you could still go to a firm or
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and make much more money
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
so you are going to be looking at people
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
that are you know interested in that
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
type of work and that's what they want
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
to do it's not going to be someone in
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
there trying to to make a career of
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
it thank you are there further questions
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
for chairman
 
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
Roy yes
 
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
Professor thank let me ask you the
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
question I I asked representative Lynn
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
at the end are you familiar with this
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
bill the next one Senate Bill 252 and
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 249 are these all
 
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
independent or they somehow connected so
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
um there was a lot of debate on how we
 
00:58:46.349 --> 00:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
should best do this at the beginning
 
00:58:49.029 --> 00:58:49.039 align:start position:0%
should we wake make one Omnibus Bill and
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
and our feeling was well first of all um
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
the the temperature of the house is we
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
don't like omnus Bill
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
um and each of these things does a very
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
detailed thing but yet they can't work
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
without the other one so if you pull the
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
magistrates out the bail changes with
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
regard to what people can be held and
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
not held falls apart so the whole thing
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
is connected but for the purposes of
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
getting it through the house so it
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
didn't look like we were trying to pack
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
a bill in the middle of the night it we
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
said let's keep it clear keep it
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
transparent keep it separate should you
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
decide or the Senate decide to Cobble it
 
00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
together for the governor I have no
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
objections but to pull something aside
 
00:59:28.829 --> 00:59:28.839 align:start position:0%
say we're not going to do this piece the
 
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
whole thing falls
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
apart you may so if we did decide to go
 
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
that way with a single Bill yes would it
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
make sense that it it sounds like these
 
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
are significant changes from what the
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
Senate sent us yes so it might make
 
00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
sense to do that with a house bill
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
rather than the Senate bill because if
 
00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
you get sent back a Senate bill it would
 
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
just be Committee of conference yes but
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
if you send them a house bill then they
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
have a full hearing and the whole works
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
right we looked at that as okay maybe if
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
we send if we make if we make one thing
 
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
and put it in the Senate bill they can
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
just vote to Concur and that piece of
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
the bill will go through but then
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to hold hearings on the
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
other stuff anyway so um I I would leave
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
it to your wisdom whether you think
 
01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
that's a better strategic move at this
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
point um just keep in mind I believe
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
that our bail reform bills are not just
 
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
house bills one of the set up bills as
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
part of it so I'm not sure how you would
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
amend that all into one bill if that's
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
even logistically possible and I believe
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
they just passed another bail bill so I
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
quit thank you represented Sweeney AG
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
grassy you have any
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you very much
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
for your time represent sure so um just
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
from a hiring standpoint if you didn't
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
get all the magistrates that you needed
 
01:00:59.029 --> 01:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
which is as likely as not might they
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
share some of the um burden between
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
counties or would you still think that
 
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
there would just be a magistrate Per
 
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
County I would think they would do
 
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
whatever we told them to do and whatever
 
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
staff we give them to do it um that
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
being said um that's what they told me
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
they needed and they thought um I know
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
that if you reduce the number of
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
magistrates it's not going to kill the
 
01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
the policy behind the bill it may make
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
it tougher to implement um I just I'm in
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
a position I don't want to give anyone
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
any excuses to say well it's not working
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
because you didn't do this or we asked
 
01:01:35.789 --> 01:01:35.799 align:start position:0%
for that and you didn't give it to us I
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
am I've I've dealt with our friends
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
across the other side um uh and the
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
other body and um you know it got pretty
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
heated at our last Committee of
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
conference and there were a lot of
 
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
fingers pointed no more we're done we we
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
we did what you asked um we did what the
 
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
court asked we did what the law
 
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement asked we got everyone so I
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
don't want want anyone coming back later
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
saying well it would have worked but for
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
so that's that's where I'm out on
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
that well I know I speak for everyone
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
here we're glad you are where you are
 
01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
with chairing the criminal justice
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
committee do a great job I really
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I'm Honor by thank you
 
01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah thank you members of the
 
01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
committee further questions on anyone
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
anyone out there on 318 that would like
 
01:02:18.119 --> 01:02:19.670 align:start position:0%
anyone out there on 318 that would like
to

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
speak seeing none will close the work
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire are you planning
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
to bring an amendment forward to maybe
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
consolidate or you have some ideas or it
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
I it's way too early so it's thank you
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
for the question I figured that's Wasing
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
around in your mind so what's going on
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
in my mind is that um all of the bills
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
that we have that spend money and and
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
we're likely to want to pass them I'm
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
tending to think we should not exact
 
01:02:58.029 --> 01:02:58.039 align:start position:0%
them or or finalize them until
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
March uh because by then we'll know
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
what's going on in other divisions with
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
other bills we'll have a total you know
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
of how much everything is going to cost
 
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
and what our resources are and stuff
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
like that so I think we have some time
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
to let these percolate and and think
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
about and and so on I mean there's some
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
bills like the first one had no fiscal
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
impact that that we could pass pretty
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
quickly I would think and maybe there's
 
01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
a few others that are just obvious Nos
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
and we itl pretty quickly but for things
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
like this where almost certainly we want
 
01:03:36.269 --> 01:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
something I would think we have some
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
time to to to to think about them that's
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
my thought no it's good point you okay
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
with that Mr
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
chairman yes you will
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
note division two I have a bill to say
 
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
this um money that all went went stuck
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund we notice
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
that because they ignored
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
our uh Amendment and just put in their
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
own and put in far more money than even
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget had and so here's
 
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
200 million that's just can't be used
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
for anything else but of course every
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
every school district's asking for a new
 
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
building because of that money sitting
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
out there so that hopefully that will
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
come and will pass and we'll move that
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
money from educ trust fund to
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
general fund and then we'll have more
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
flexibility as you say we'll know later
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
on in the session do we have that extra
 
01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
money plus we're going to have meetings
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
today with with the
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
U the court system about this all these
 
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
monies that they're paying out for the
 
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
victims of the sununu litigation which
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
the judge and I have had discussions it
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
does seem it's excessive we gave them a
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
budget we wish they'd stay within it so
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to have those discussions
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
here both today and within um
 
01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal but we may have to come up with
 
01:05:05.549 --> 01:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
some more money for that but anyway yeah
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that that will pass and then
 
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
things like this that we'll be seeing in
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
the meantime we'll get all these other
 
01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
bills spending money so we want to know
 
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
where we've got money to spend if
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
any thanks Ken so moving it's 11 o'clock
 
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
or there abouts um Senate bill
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
252 relative to the release of
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
defendants pending trial Etc is someone
 
01:05:34.269 --> 01:05:34.279 align:start position:0%
here to speak to that I saw you were on
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
the list I
 
01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
wishing though I see the Secretary of
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
State here and I'm wondering maybe he
 
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
didn't get the message about one of the
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
was coming
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
up no it is
 
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
not so there was a there was apparently
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
there was a problem that came to us and
 
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
it should have gone to the policy
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
committee or something like that but I
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
can explain yeah represent MCU yes so so
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire I'll just explain so
 
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
um we only see things in division as a
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
second committee when when we have a
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
bill that's brand new like this one we
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
have we have a full committee public
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
hearing first and and it so we made a
 
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
mistake and we didn't realize that it
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
was new and not arriving via some other
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
committee so that's the problem so we'll
 
01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
be in the big room at some point yeah
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
there should have been a notice sorry
 
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
you didn't get it but yeah went out last
 
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
week but thank you I figured you must it
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%

chairman

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
Roy it's nice to see all of you again
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um representative
 
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
Terry Roy Rockingham 31 uh chairman
 
01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
criminal justice on on the bill I uh
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
before you now um I would just reiterate
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
everything I said five minutes ago um
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
they're all Interlink they're all tied
 
01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
together um and I just I think it would
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
be better if you've looked at the bill
 
01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
if you had certain questions I'd be
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
happy to try and answer them for
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you do we have a new
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal note yes we do uhuh dated 160
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
gotta yeah I haven't really
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
looked all right so um this says that
 
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to be spending 1.7 million
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
in the first year is that to create some
 
01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
kind of uh computer system or something
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
like that um if I could just for a
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
second because I haven't seen a new FAL
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
it Mr
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
hofman that amount comes from the
 
01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in the bill at the end of
 
01:08:11.559 --> 01:08:22.829 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in the bill at the end of
the

01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
Okay this may be um with regard to the
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
monitoring I think electronic monitoring
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
um based on what I'm seeing in the
 
01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note the one of the pieces of the
 
01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
bill um that we we struggled with was
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with people who were
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
rearrested um as a policy issue what was
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
happening um in many communities and
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
many communities were very upset about
 
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
is you had people that would be arrested
 
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
and and they're not people that were
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
arrested for for for horrific crimes
 
01:08:56.829 --> 01:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
they were what we kind of coined as
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
nuisance crimes these are your
 
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
disorderly person your trespass your uh
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
petty theft your shoplifting and they'd
 
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
get bailed on personal recognizance and
 
01:09:09.789 --> 01:09:09.799 align:start position:0%
a day later or two days later they'd get
 
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
picked up again and again personal
 
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
recognizance because these are not um
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
these are classy misdemeanors some of
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
them don't even have jail time if you
 
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
get found guilty so we had a revolving
 
01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
door so we put in there that okay you
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
get two bites that Apple if you get
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
arrested again after you're out on bail
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
you are held um and you can explain to
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
the judge why you cannot seem to refrain
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
from Criminal Behavior but one of them
 
01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:34.759 align:start position:0%
was for people who committed domestic
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
violence um people who are accused of
 
01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
domestic violence are entitled to bail
 
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
like everybody else but for safety
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
purposes as which was also part of the
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
policy of the spills to enhance Public
 
01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
Safety we insisted that people that who
 
01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
are released on bail for violating a
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
protective order be given electronic
 
01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.510 align:start position:0%
protective order be given electronic
monitor

01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
monitor
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
that can be monitored by um someone the
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
court assigns to see that that person
 
01:10:01.149 --> 01:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
stays away from the victim and they're
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
not where they're supposed to be and
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
keep in mind this is just people who are
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
violated a protective order not who just
 
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
got arrested on the original domestic
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
so naturally it is going to have a
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal no I would I would say that if
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
you look at the statutes the ability to
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
use electronic monitoring has been in
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
our statutes for years it's just never
 
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
been implemented and part of the reason
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
is cuz we never gave the courts the
 
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
money and said do it we just said you
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
can use electronic monitoring well
 
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
that's great but if you don't fund it
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
and tell them do it it's just worthless
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
words on a piece of paper so we've
 
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
actually putting teeth into it and we
 
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
want it to be implemented just about
 
01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
every other state in the country uses
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
these um we're our our computer and
 
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
electronics in New Hampshire is is so
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
behind the times we're working on 80s
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
level stuff here um and it's really sad
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
when you know that there's places in
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
this state that don't even have computer
 
01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
terminals to run somebody's record at a
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
police station one of the worst things
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
that I'd call to your attention that is
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
that you can and some of that money goes
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
to this is that you can be arrested
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
right now and conquered for an assault
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
and battery happens in front of a police
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
officer he arrest you you get
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
bailed and conditions of bail don't get
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
arrested again stay out of you could
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
drive to Portsmith and get arrest
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
arrested again that same day the next
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
day the bail commissioner and everyone
 
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
there thinks it's your first arrest
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
because that's not recorded it's not
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
shared between the so you could
 
01:11:38.189 --> 01:11:38.199 align:start position:0%
theoretically string up four or five
 
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
arrests before someone finally realize
 
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
hey wait a minute you're on bail from an
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
arrest three arrests ago um which is
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
very sad in this day and age we have the
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
capabilities to do this we just have to
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
tell them to do it and give them the
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
money to do it so that's that's about
 
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
all I can say about that so further
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you so so would this
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring just be for
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or would they use get
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to use it on more
 
01:12:07.149 --> 01:12:07.159 align:start position:0%
things because presumably that saves
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
money from not having somebody overnight
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
in a County Jail it does and and they're
 
01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
authorized to use it for whatever they
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
see fit it's in the statute that they
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
can and we're only mandating it if
 
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to let someone out who's
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
who's violated an order already you have
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
to use it um I would hope that once they
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
actually have the system in front of
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
them they say hey we can use this on a
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
lot more things but what I can't do is
 
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
go and say you're going to use on this
 
01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
offense this offense I I don't want to
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
the judges are judges for a reason so I
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
let them I just want them aware that
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
they have this tool now and that they
 
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
will hopefully um use it but we're
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
mandating it for that one thing I think
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise it would be too complex to
 
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
micromanage it do one more do you have
 
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
an idea of numbers like how many um
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
people are on bail for domestic violence
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
and and roughly how long or do they are
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
they in that condition um sadly there's
 
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
going to be several hundred a year who
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
are arrested for violating restraining
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
orders um so if they're going to be
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
entitled The Bear you could be looking
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
at several hundred of these whether it's
 
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
at one time I I don't really have it and
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's another problem if you want to go
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
to the courts and get statistics be
 
01:13:17.629 --> 01:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
prepared to drive because you every
 
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
single court is a silo there's no system
 
01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
where you can go and say how many
 
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
domestic arrests were there in the state
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
of last year no you start driving which
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
is horribly sad in this day and age
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
again we are so far behind technology
 
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:35.629 align:start position:0%
again we are so far behind technology
wise

01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.189 --> 01:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
thank I thought we put in a bill last
 
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
time you when I talked did did in the
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
Senate killed the money remember
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
yeah they said if you don't give me
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
these is that your foreign
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
comment uh Mr Mr Hoffman is it possible
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
for you and or Melissa to put something
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
together for us with all the bills that
 
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
are dealing with this uh bill issue and
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
the cost of same kind of following in
 
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
what representative Maguire talked about
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
you know combining them but at least
 
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
give us an idea of collectively the
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
costs of all the different bail
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
bills yes I can work on that
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
thanks it'll take a
 
01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:24.920 align:start position:0%

door can I just ask uh representative
 
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
