story I wanted to share before giving my
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
conclusion for the bill is um from
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
August of 2020 to January of 2021 I was
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
briefly a member of an organization
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
called infragard which is a public
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
private Partnership of the FBI which is
 
00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:32.519 align:start position:0%
which is stated mission is to uh you
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
know protecting critical infrastructure
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the United States um I lost
 
00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
confidence in the way that the country
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
was going in January of 2021 and I
 
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
actually canceled my membership in the
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh in the organization of infragard it's
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit um I wasn't active I
 
00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:49.959 align:start position:0%
received emails from them I didn't
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
attend any meetings but it seemed more
 
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
like infragard is almost like a nanny
 
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
State kind of thing where it just has
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
private citizens walking around looking
 
00:08:59.710 --> 00:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
out for their own uh you know
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
look looking out for their own or
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
watching I'm sorry um private private
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
citizens looking spying on each other
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
almost that's that's the impression
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
that's the way it felt you know because
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
no one had I never heard of it before
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
until I had to join as part of an online
 
00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
degree uh I lost confidence in the way
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
the direction was of the country was
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
going in January 2021 and I canceled my
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
membership because I didn't trust the
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
incoming Administration and about you
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
know 3 weeks after the new inauguration
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:35.959 align:start position:0%
there there was the executive order that
 
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
was issued that kind of allowed China
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
access to the electrical grid and I did
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
not appreciate that I lost confidence
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
and I was like I didn't I'm glad I got
 
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
out of this I didn't want to pay didn't
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
want to be part of it doesn't make sense
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
um that's a fun backstory you know on
 
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
principle we shouldn't be selling land
 
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
in our state to a foreign country it's
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
we should sell it to uh private citizens
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire first and private
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
citizens of uh of the United States
 
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
first and then other American owned
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
corporations uh we should not be selling
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
um know our land
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
or or industrial critical Industries to
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
a foreign country I'm sorry guys I
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
stutter um my recommendation for this
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
thousand supporting uh members and we
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
are in uh opposition to the bill is
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
introduced proded um if uh if you plan
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
on moving forward uh we would ask for a
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
at least an amendment that would uh uh
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
the way the Bill's written it's so broad
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
that would enable uh land to be leased
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
for research and educational purposes
 
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
and we we say that with one particular
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
entity in mine um senta is a uh
 
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
worldwide leader in crop protectant and
 
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
Seed research and as well as well as
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
sales and we would hope that if there
 
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
was the opportunity at our agriculture
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
experiment station in Durham or the in
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
the university in some other way that
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
that that senta wanted to uh fund some
 
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
research that we would have the
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to participate in that
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
um so I got since senta is a a company
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
that is is uh was was founded and today
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
is still uh headquartered in Switzerland
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
and back in
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
2017 it was purchased by uh the the the
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
Chinese National Chemical Corporation so
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
it it it is it is controlled by in the
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
end uh by uh the the Chinese government
 
00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
um this has been as you're probably
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
aware it's a big issue Nationwide our
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
National Organization has been involved
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
in this quite a bit and done a lot a
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
good bit of research I've left with the
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
clerk and I have some more copies of
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
some uh uh study that that they did uh
 
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
real helpful that you just email those I
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
will I have the electronically and I
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
will do that that would be great is
 
00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
there if and just let me know there's a
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
particular uh email that I should use
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
house Commerce we'll do and so that is
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
one and then uh just a little bit of
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
extra data I did contact American Farm
 
00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
Bureau with the the the data you in that
 
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:34.519 align:start position:0%
report it's not State specific but I
 
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
asked for some State data in particular
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
I asked for how much farmland or uh is
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
is is does China the Chinese Nationals
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
own uh in New Hampshire and there there
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
is none uh the the only uh land that is
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
reported is this just under 100 acres
 
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
reported in penobscott County Maine and
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
we take that that's probably Forest land
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
and and that you'll see it in the report
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
but it it kind of gets to one of the
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
issues that that requires uh the
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
reporting is self-reporting and the
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
self-reporting is to the USGA Farm
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
Service Agency and and and that um kind
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
of uh shows you uh uh uh you could
 
00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
question the accuracy of the data SC and
 
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
it is voluntary compliance in reporting
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
and beyond that if an entity is is
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to have reported and reports
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
late they are fined at a substantial
 
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
amount so it discourages self-reporting
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
after the fact
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
um- which which kind of leads me to a
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
question with the bill I see there's no
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal note so to to uh uh to police
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
this and such you you you're you're
 
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
going to need some some
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
funds lastly uh I I will say that also
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
and I provided a copy to the clerk but
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
the USDA has has uh um opened a docket
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
on this uh seeking uh comments on their
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
current process and that's open until I
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
believe it's February mid-February I
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
think once say the 16th I again I I can
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
provide you a copy of that uh uh docket
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
that that I registered notice uh
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
electronically and and I guess the final
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
thing is that just to you're probably
 
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
already aware but there is a similar
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
bill over in the senate senate pel 366
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
on this that is being heard next Tuesday
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
in Senate Commerce I'll leave it at that
 
00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for timeing attention Mr
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
chair great any questions from committee
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
question I'm a little a little confused
 
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
in the sense that uh the the Chinese
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
purchase of the the organization in
 
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
Switzerland um does that
 
00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:53.959 align:start position:0%
um I don't the bill to me is is you
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
don't sell land or infrastructure to uh
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
China that's the that's the aim of the
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
bill I mean I am I missing something if
 
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
you read the bill a little clearly if
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
you see that they're they're they're
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
looking for the long arm anything that
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
you have any connection any company that
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
has any connection with the People's
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
Republic of China or the uh the party is
 
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
is what it says in the bill you have the
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
bill in front of you there yeah but but
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
but the but what they bought was a uh um
 
00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
a scientific organization
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
uh as opposed to a landowning
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
organization it says any part of
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
ownership part of ownership in other
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
words because that company has invest
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
has China as as an owner part owner yeah
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
that means they would be barred from
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
under this legislation they would be
 
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
barred from buying land in New Hampshire
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
they they own land and facilities in
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
order to conduct their research it was
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
you may have heard of it in Arkansas
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
recently where they passed the law and
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh then and senta owns a seed company in
 
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
Arkansas that employed a a vast majority
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
of of people in a particular community
 
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
and they required that they sell that
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
facility and that happen and that that
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
particular Senter happens to be the
 
00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
largest contributor to FFA Future
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
Farmers of America organization the
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
state of
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
Arkansas and you're saying that when
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
Arkansas passed this legislation they
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
were forced to sell the yes yeah whether
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
I get I should whether it's been sold
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
yet or not I don't know but they are
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
being forced
 
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
to they have a a deadline to meet okay
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
in one particular Community it's going
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
to devastate them because they're all
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
they live in the community they need to
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
go elsewhere so I have a follow on
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
question you know why further question
 
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
meire further question is uh so is is
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
this uh membership in the Swiss
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
organization uh critical uh to the
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
United States I mean in terms of the
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
science of uh the the company was
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
founded and is now owned in and
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
headquartered in Switzerland like it's I
 
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
would say it is
 
00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
critical okay so we don't we don't have
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
an alternative further question yes for
 
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
the question number three and I'll stop
 
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
there we don't so we don't have an
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
alternative uh organization in the
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
United States to to do this
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
research well there like yeah there are
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
competitors uh Senter like Bayer if
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
you've heard of Bayer
 
00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
Monsanto a couple of the other comp any
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
entity that's that's that's
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
manufacturing is German yeah yeah
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
correct but and any company that's
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturing uh producing or
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
researching crop protectants seed that
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
type of thing would be a competitor so
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
yes we do have Alternatives in this
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
country but Senter is a leading entity
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
and they may be I just use Senter as a
 
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
prime example right that was just an
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
example great thank you we have any
 
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.750 align:start position:0%
example great thank you we have any
other

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
questions all set thank you very much uh
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else would like to
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
testify did you did I get a card from
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
you Tim okay here we
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
go represent
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
hgan opposition to the bill yes well I'm
 
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
certainly um I do not consider myself a
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
communist so I'm certainly glad I don't
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
live in in in China but the uh what we
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
used to call Red China there is actually
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
they are very good at capitalism and um
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
they're the second largest economy in
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
the world we do have to coexist with
 
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
them and um so even though communist is
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
a dirty word on both sides the political
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
Spectrum here um I think this bill is
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
overly overly broad because um you know
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
we we have have to coexist the Chinese
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
are uh you know as I said they're the
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
second greatest biggest economic power
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
in the world we're in a symbiotic
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
relationship with them like I apologize
 
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
my phone went off by accident I believe
 
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
that phone was mostly components of
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
phone were in fact manufactured in uh
 
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
the People's Republic of China so
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
U and uh C especially uh as and I see
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
the concern about the Farmland also the
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
critical Industries there's also the
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
whole issue of uh you know Battery
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
Technology that we're way behind the
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
Chinese have been uh much more so than
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
the capitalists here in the US
 
00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:35.559 align:start position:0%
aggressively investing in in electric
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles and other battery technologies
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
and um the other thing I might say the
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
communist country that really scares me
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
is Russia because Putin even though
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
economically he doesn't uh even doesn't
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
follow the economic policies of the old
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
Soviet Union he up that's obviously what
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
he's up to he is trying to reconstitute
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
the Soviet Union and I certainly think
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
we should be doing U even more than we
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
are now to stop that I mean there's some
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
people seem to even want want to let
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
Putin go ahead and take over the former
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
Soviet republics but that's U that's a
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
subject for another bill or another
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
debate so I I mean I I'm not eager to
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
vote for an itl if it comes to the floor
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
but I think um probably passing this
 
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
current form it's very Broad and um it's
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's very Broad and it's not not
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
not ready to be passed and probably the
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
basic idea behind it has some flaws
 
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
certainly a uh certainly your best bet
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
would either to amend it so it's not as
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
broad or um or put it send the interim
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
study and I also like to add as others
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
notice there are many foreign or
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
corporations here in the US like Bae is
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
based in Britain um in my area there's
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
six sour major manufacturer Firearms
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
they're uh they're based in Switzerland
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
so I I just I I I think understand the
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
concern behind this bill and I share it
 
00:21:59.470 --> 00:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
but I just don't think actually putting
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
this language into law would be a good
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
idea so uh that's uh and I probably make
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
probably probably wasn't a good idea for
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
me to come here on YouTube uh you know
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
doing anything other than totally
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
condemning communist China which has
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
many many problems but you know they are
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
good at capitalism probably they're
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
probably uh better at us at being
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
capitalists so sort of like it's a it's
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
a society which is very oppressive in
 
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
some ways but it's some way some other
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
ways it's uh less oppressive but anyway
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
so that's I would say don't pass the
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced at least we'll see
 
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
what the alternative is and I'm sure you
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.269 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:22:39.269 --> 00:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much is there anyone
 
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
else here would like to speak on

you good morning Mr chairman and members
 
00:22:57.549 --> 00:22:57.559 align:start position:0%
of the um Commerce Committee my name is
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
Jonathan Leslie I am speaking Pro to

this bill as an individual um I'm an
 
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:02.919 align:start position:0%
army combat infantry veteran from seven

and my wife and I both run a small farm
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
over in Deerfield um I'm supporting this
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
bill to a long-term threat of continued
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
Chinese purchases of both Prime
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
agricultural land and American
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure I'd like to read a quote
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
from a book titled unrestricted Warfare
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
which was written in 1999 by two
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
Colonels in the chines Air Force if one
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
party is at war with another and the
 
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
other does not realize it is at War the
 
00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
party who knows it as war is almost
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
always has the advantage and usually
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
wins Waging War on an adversary with
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
meth methods so benign that the party
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
being attacked does not realize it's
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
being attacked um China's been waging
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
economic Warfare on the United States
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
for close to 20 years um and we have
 
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
minimal protected policies within our
 
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
law China's responsible for close to 90%
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
of the industrial Espionage committed
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
against us companies according to
 
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
various studies which causes billions of
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
dollars in damage annually this bill is
 
00:23:59.710 --> 00:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
vit ly important as both PRC and Chinese
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
companies controlling either our
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
agricultural land or critical indust
 
00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
Industries would reduce both our
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
security and resilience at the state
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
level China already owns the largest
 
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
pork producer in America which is
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
Smithfield and due to its production
 
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
contracts approximately 25% of American
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
pork and pigs while New Hampshire's
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
agricultural production might not be
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
huge we do need to protect what we have
 
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
can you imagine allowing Soviet
 
00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
countries as the prior rep talked about
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
owning land or critical Industries
 
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
during the Cold War venting this common
 
00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
these purchases is common sense to
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
protect our nation leadership in both
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
parties consider China at this Federal
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
level the most exential threat to our
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
country there should be bipartisan
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
agreement on this bill future of our
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
country is at stake and we need to
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
ensure our children and grandchildren
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
are able to grow up in what we what will
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
continue to be the best country in the
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
world and please think of the future we
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
continue uh considering this
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
bill great thank you uh do you mind
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%

sh

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:56.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:31:57.629 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:31:57.629 --> 00:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
chair all right good morning chairman
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I'm
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative Jim Summers I represent
 
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 20 today I'm
 
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
introducing HB uh 1232 an act
 
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
prohibiting New Hampshire state and
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
local governments from using and
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
applying a ban on Central Bank digital
 
00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:27.669 align:start position:0%
applying a ban on Central Bank digital
currency

00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
currency
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
what is Central Bank digital currency
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
Central Bank digital currency also known
 
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
as abbreviated cbdc is a digital form of
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
central bank's money with the same value
 
00:32:39.389 --> 00:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
and function as physical
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
cash there are potential benefits to
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
having a cbdc like most if not all of
 
00:32:45.559 --> 00:32:46.230 align:start position:0%
having a cbdc like most if not all of
the

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
benefits like having a cheaper faster
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
and more effective Financial
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
transactions however there are drawbacks
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
as well some of those positives are when
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
you receive a cash you take it to your
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
bank and you know that you have to wait
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
two or 3 days before it to clear so
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
it'll show in your
 
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
account some of those drawbacks though
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
however um include privacy may be eroded
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
at all Financial transactions may be
 
00:33:16.269 --> 00:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
monitored and tracked in real time also
 
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
more personal information may be
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
collected The Government Can conduct
 
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
more surveillance as they can collect
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
more data and do more tracking and
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
monitoring cyber security risk may arise
 
00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
as cbdc has to be online consequently
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
the network may be vulnerable to cyber
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
attacks because cbdc needs to be online
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
a shutdown of the network May collapse
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
the financial system the closing of
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
banks may occur as they're no longer
 
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
needed to provide these Financial
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
Services as the central bank would
 
00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.950 align:start position:0%
Services as the central bank would
provide

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
them they would be this was include
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
needed for deposits payment settlements
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
and other Financial products and
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
Services implementing a cbdc may prove
 
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
costly and complex as significant
 
00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
investments in technology infrastructure
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
regulation Personnel Etc may be
 
00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
required a cbdc can be programmed and as
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
such it may be used to have greater
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
control over individuals and business
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
finances the implementation of cbdc will
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
require changes to the Regulatory and
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
legal framework that governs the
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
financial sector Central Bank digital
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
currencies do not stop governments and

centrally managed centrally controlled
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
cbdc is a tool for coercion and control
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
and that it would allow the government
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
to spy on the citizenry and what we buy
 
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
and purchase and regulate and how we
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
cbdcs Alabama Florida North Carolina and
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
Texas China in fact wanted to control
 
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
their people from saving and wanted
 
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
their money to be circulated in their
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
economy so they have put expiration
 
00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
dates on their cbdcs basically it's a
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
use it or lose it you can't save your
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
money in China because the expiration
 
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
date you have to spend it to keep it in
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
the economy therefore a cbdc can be
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
controlled and manipulated by the
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
government that it provides
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
it there's nothing stopping a government
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
from knowing what you are buying
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
expiring your currency limiting what you
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
can buy and instead of printing more
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
money they simply increase the number
 
00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:16.790 align:start position:0%
money they simply increase the number
that's

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
available now I know many folks have
 
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
complained about there was heay of where
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
the IRS was going to document everything
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
sold for over $600
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
and many citizens the United States have
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
complained about that why would have to
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
report purchases of over
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
$600 can you imagine that every report
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
of you buying a 50 Cent 75 cent candy
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
bar is reported to the federal
 
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
government due to this
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
CA I think not that's why I'm against
 
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
this bill I mean that's why I'm for this
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
bill to ban
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
cbdcs and I'm welcome to takeing your
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
questions I have a
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
question okay yes representative Fe I'm
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
going to try to keep it shorter than I
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
usually do that would be
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
great so I wrote a letter to the Federal
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
Reserve and I asked them very
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
specifically what were their plans for
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
cbdc not rumors I don't want to know
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
rumors I want to know
 
00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
facts what were their plans and what
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
under what conditions could they ever
 
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
issue a CD cbdc and what laws are
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
involved that we would be in violation
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
of if we tried to stop it and I got
 
00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
just matter of fact I got an answer back
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
from them two days ago they sent me a
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
document 5600 pages
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
long that included the comments from
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
everybody from PayPal Google every just
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
about every Bank in the country that had
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
an opinion on what they thought a cbdc
 
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
should look like that was the major
 
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
question some of the evaluations were
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
incredibly impressive they people went
 
00:38:56.349 --> 00:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
various organizations especially PayPal
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
went went on for pages about well it
 
00:39:00.309 --> 00:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
needs to do this it needs to do that and
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
I asked and one of the things that the
 
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839 align:start position:0%
uh Central Bank said uh Federal Reserve
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
which is what we call it said that they
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
are in the process it'll be years before
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
they get this figur out because they
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
want to take all of that into
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
consideration and they are evaluating it
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
as far as any laws are concerned they
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
cannot issue according to them they
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
cannot issue a cbdc without a law being
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
passed in Congress and without funding
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
from Congress there are two bills in
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
Congress right now to stop it those
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
bills have been put through this is the
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
second time around for both of them that
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
are Banning
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
cbdcs uh they're not getting a lot of
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
popularity because mostly what everybody
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
wants to see is what do you think it's
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
going to look like cuz no one knows
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
right now what it's going to look like
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
they've been testing the infrastructure
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
they've been testing the ability to
 
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
maintain security maintain speed
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
maintain privacy but they have not
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
characterized it yet so we're getting a
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
lot of opinions from all over the state
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
all over the country all over the world
 
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact some of the com com
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
comments are coming from the UK from
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
Japan from all kinds of places of what
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
it should look like so what you my
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
question to you is you want to ban
 
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
something that you don't know what it
 
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:14.839 align:start position:0%
looks like don't know what it's going to
 
00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
do don't know the benefits you haven't
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
done a cost benefit cost benefit
 
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
analysis and yet you want the state to
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
disobey the Constitution of the United
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
States and ban something what litigation
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
what do you hope with going to gain from
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your question so what
 
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
I what I was looking at is actually
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
twofold one is how you are correct in
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that the United States has not
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
passed the cbdc as of yet in fact it's
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
still current study and they are deating
 
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
it in Congress as we
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
speak where this bill actually came to
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
be is following basically four states
 
00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
that have implemented it as well as how
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's been abused overseas now now
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
granted we can't take it effect that the
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
United States would follow China's lead
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
and put time expirations on our currency
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
we can't say that we would follow China
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
to monitor everything that every person
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
in a household would Monitor and collect
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
but this I just might say these four
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
Bill these four laws that pass these
 
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
four states this I'm not I'm not talking
 
00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
about a partisan bill here we passed
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
Florida 116
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
to1 in favor it was unanimous in the
 
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
Senate it passed Indiana 129
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
to2 Republicans and Democrats both in
 
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
both States voted overwhelmingly in
 
00:41:40.349 --> 00:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
favor of this ban so it's not a partisan
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
bill I mean it is a partisan it's
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill it's not partisan in
 
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
fact of political parties or what the
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
usage of the thing is it's a simple
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
basic as far as Florida's law it was one
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
line ended one sentence added on the end
 
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
of the definition of money in their
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
Statute in this it is adding one section
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
onto the end of the monetary scope of
 
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:11.079 align:start position:0%
the RSA predominately it can be if we
 
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
find that it actually is and comes to a
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
point to where it is suable then we can
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
actually repeal it it is one section all
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
by itself not tied to anything else
 
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
except for the final add-on explanation
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
to the monetary use in
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
State I I I I'm sorry I have one more
 
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
question or follow on'll finish yeah yes
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
sir further question further question
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
and it will be briefer than the yes this
 
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm
 
00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
sorry I have the bill from Florida and I
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
have the fysical note on it and the
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
fisical note on it says and I can quote
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
it and I can give you the fysical bill
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
the fysical note for the Florida bill it
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
says this law is unconstitutional and if
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
it passes it will cause Untold
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
undetermined damage to the economics of
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
the state and they passed a bill that
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
says that that their physical note says
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
in writing attached to the bill that it
 
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
is unconstitutional and will cause
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
Untold damage and that's what you that's
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
the litigation you're putting us in the
 
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.510 align:start position:0%
the litigation you're putting us in the
way

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
of would you
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
believe would you believe you don't have
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
believe representative kid
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um may I ask two
 
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
questions Mr chairman may I ask two
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you uh okay uh my first
 
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
question is um as I'm sure you're aware
 
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh a great deal of banking these days is
 
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
done online I myself do almost all my
 
00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
banking online um why would uh Central
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
Bank digital currency be more in
 
00:43:59.470 --> 00:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
dangered uh of being uh disrupted by
 
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
systems it's actually not more difficult
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
the the main thing is the centralization
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
so where where we are divided between
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
many state federally owned local
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
business small business Banks where all
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
of our money is Diversified among many
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
different things you might have an
 
00:44:26.109 --> 00:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
account at at Merl Lynch marac Valley or
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
at Morgan Stanley the fact is with the
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
central bank is it po puts everybody in
 
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
the entire country's money into one spot
 
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
and so all you would have to have is one
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
target to be able to hit
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
Nationwide thank you for your answer uh
 
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
second question is um if uh cdbc were to
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
um go into practice um which I gather
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
from the uh previous questioner um is
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
not likely anytime soon uh but if it
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
were to go into practice uh you've
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned dangers of uh Federal
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
tracking and control um which honestly
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand but uh for the
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
for the sake of argument um taking your
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
your position um would anybody be forced
 
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
cdbc honestly that's still open because
 
00:45:27.549 --> 00:45:27.559 align:start position:0%
as of the cbdc does not exist as of yet
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you talk a little slower
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
I couldn't hear you oh sure um as of
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
right now it's unknown because the CBC
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
does not exist as of yet if we are
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
followed to where other countries that
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
have implemented cbdc like Nigeria which
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
it failed and like China then everyone
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
is required to use it in
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
China thank you and then Nigeria
 
00:45:58.589 --> 00:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
our questions um your your bill uh has
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh a definition at the end uh it says uh
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
Central Bank digital currency means a
 
00:46:11.069 --> 00:46:11.079 align:start position:0%
digital currency used by a central bank
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
and made available to the public get get
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
closer did you hear what I what I said
 
00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
Central Bank uh digital currency means a
 
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
digital currency used by a central bank
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
and made available to the public and I
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
want to focus on to the public parts so
 
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:29.079 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a retail uh Central
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
Bank digital currency but not uh one
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's intank uh would you agree with
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
that that is correct so there's two
 
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
different divisions of cbdc and how
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
they're utilized there is the retail and
 
00:46:44.549 --> 00:46:44.559 align:start position:0%
there's the wholesale the wholesale is
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
generally defined as money and how it's
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
transferred between countries or large
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
scale where retail would entitle the
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
money or the banks that us normal
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
exchange and so a retail Central Bank
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
digital currency has the potential of
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
making our current banking system
 
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
obsolete uh potentially right that's
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
yes okay great thank you very much thank
 
00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
you uh let's see Tim
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
Morgan in
 
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:34.230 align:start position:0%
Morgan in
opposition

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much I'm so I'm
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
opposed I am opposed to this bill I
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
although I understand the concerns
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
behind it I think the first reason why
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to it is it's massively
 
00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
premature I haven't read 6600 pages of
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
of like a ran spear did but like I've
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
seen some of the uh documents the
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve point out there a long
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
ways away from doing it they have a lot
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
of doubts about it they also like know
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't be universally popular
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
if they did it
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
um and um two other and one of the fears
 
00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:10.839 align:start position:0%
that's being ProMag about it is that
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
we'll eliminate all cash and there's um
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
I was listening to AM radio the first
 
00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:17.079 align:start position:0%
time in a while because I was listening
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
to a UNH basketball game on way back
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
from Manchester so I heard all the ads I
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
had on WG am which mostly runs uh I
 
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
guess conservative talk show programming
 
00:48:28.829 --> 00:48:28.839 align:start position:0%
and you know they had um you know Fox
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
News host saying you need to buy gold to
 
00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:32.839 align:start position:0%
protect yourself from the cbdc and they
 
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
had the whole thing about how you won't
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
be able to have a yard sale or Etc and
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
so the part about cash I think is uh it
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
would be a very bad idea to abolish cash
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
but although we are kind of moving
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
towards uh less and less use of use of
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
cash and actually one of the reasons why
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve is unlikely to
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
abolish cash is because um the well the
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
entire money supply is uh is a debt of
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
the US government and that includes uh a
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
trillion dollars worth of $100 bills
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
which are mostly held overseas so I
 
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
don't think they're uh I don't think
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
they're too eager to repay that uh
 
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
interest free loan of of a trillion
 
00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:16.839 align:start position:0%
dollars that they've uh that the uh the
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
holders of those dollar $100 bills have
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
very generously made to the United
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
States so that alone is a reason why
 
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
they're probably unlikely to abolish
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
cash and they don't want
 
00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:29.799 align:start position:0%
they the wording the FED they're not
 
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
eager to move forward with this they see
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems with it and then one
 
00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
of but then one other point I want to
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
make is we already have a centralized
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
cbdc only it's decentralized so we most
 
00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:45.799 align:start position:0%
of us use mostly uh online payments so
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
that's um that's
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh that's monitored by that's being
 
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
operated by very large um and rather um
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
not at all C organized uh Consortium of
 
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
banking institutions and others and
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
those those institutions are uh you know
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
politically very powerful so there' be a
 
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
lot of push back uh to anything any
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
attempt to like bring in a cbdc so
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's not something the Federal Reserve
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
can really do unilaterally and it
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
also it's also extremely profitable to
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
people who are operating those online
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
systems um there's you know you probably
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
we've had some bills about swipe fees
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
they're a very large uh you know they're
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
very large uh portion of the economy and
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
maybe and this bill of course uh doesn't
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
do anything one way or another about
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
that that is one of the rational for
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
cbdc is in that would uh eliminate the
 
00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:39.079 align:start position:0%
swipe fees and also make it easier for
 
00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:40.839 align:start position:0%
people who currently don't have bank
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
accounts um and the uh other thing is we
 
00:50:46.589 --> 00:50:46.599 align:start position:0%
already have the surveillance um like we
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
had the tragic incident in conquered
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
year where uh two people were two people
 
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
were murdered and the uh murderer and I
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
do remember his name but I don't want to
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
say it here um we he was making a lot of
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
efforts to live off the grid and um he
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
was trying to stay underground as much
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
as he could but nevertheless we were
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
able the prosecutors when he murdered
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
those two people and figured out he and
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
he became a suspect they were able to um
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
they were still able to very effectively
 
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
track just about all of his transactions
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
in great detail all of his movements so
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
um so that that's happening all that's
 
00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:24.799 align:start position:0%
happening already and that's nothing new
 
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
like even quarter of a century ago when
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
23 years ago when we had the 9911
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
attacks we were they were also like uh
 
00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
trying to fly under the radar and once
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
again um once again after the after the
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
terrorist attacks we were able we were
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
able to like figure out a great detail
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
who these people were where they went
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
what they spent money on so the horse is
 
00:51:48.789 --> 00:51:48.799 align:start position:0%
probably already out of the barn in this
 
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
issue so it's just a question of uh what
 
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
form the electronic payments system
 
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
should take and I don't
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
so I think this bill the concerns behind
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
it are valid but I think it's premature
 
00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
and also we these the Federal Reserve is
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
the uh 12 federal reserve banks are
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
collectively the Central Bank of our
 
00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
country and we are in the United States
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
of America the United States dollar is
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
our currency so these things that POS a
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
lot of legal difficulties because they
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh the cbdc deposits would be uh
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
presumably legal tender just like uh
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
just like Federal Reserve notes are are
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
now so
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
um I hoping to keep under the two
 
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
minutes on the pink card but I didn't
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
but anyway that's uh that's why that's
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
why I'm opposed to the bills so and you
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
can ask me any questions if you want
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
whether I can answer them or not I don't
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
know but I don't think there's any
 
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
questions oh good thanks thank you thank
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr
 
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:01.720 align:start position:0%

answering some of the some of the
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked or some of the
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
statements about we don't have enough
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
information we have more than enough
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
information to know how bad this is you
 
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839 align:start position:0%
know we're talking about decades ago
 
00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
where there was a quote by Henry
 
00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:21.799 align:start position:0%
Kissinger that said who controls the
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
money controls the
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
world one world government and agenda
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
2030 is full underway and has been for
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
over a
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
decade there's many people in this state
 
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
one is actually out of state right now
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
that's speaking on this cbdc this is all
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
he's doing his name is Aon day he's an
 
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:43.880 align:start position:0%

cbdcs I will get every single one of you
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
that book I'm a little disappointed that
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're missing 10 Representatives here
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
because this is such a huge issue I also
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak about Florida's bill um
 
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
Aaron day actually had a one-on-one
 
00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
conversation specifically with our
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
governor DeSantis of Florida's governor
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
Dan santis about this
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
because representative Spire you're
 
00:54:20.349 --> 00:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
actually correct spear sorry um you're
 
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
actually correct in that bill doesn't do
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
anything there's no protection there's
 
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
no true Banning of
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
cbdcs um Aaron day also spoke with
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative uh I mean uh Senator Ted
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
Cruz in Texas about this in their bill
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
and even though it goes further it's
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
still not enough but Senator Cruz
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
specifically said and he's there so he
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
knows that this is happening no matter
 
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
what there's no one that's going to be
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
able to stop it it's coming down the
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
pike I really I would appreciate you you
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
you reading the the book If you're
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
willing I will give it to you this is
 
00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:03.559 align:start position:0%
about global Finance change
 
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
so you know there was a question that
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
you said about what is it what does it
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
look like and in the first chapter of
 
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
his book I'm going to read this and then
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
I will be uh I'll be done is this though
 
00:55:21.549 --> 00:55:21.559 align:start position:0%
the work of fiction in the first chapter
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
the story draws inspiration from
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
surveillance technologies that inade our
 
00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
world today if left unchecked the
 
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
scenario painted within this first
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
chapter could be hauntingly could be a
 
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
hauntingly accurate reflection of life
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
in the not so distant future this book
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
aims to shed light on the truth behind
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
the tale unearthing the grand designs to
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
bring such a reality into existence even
 
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
in places like the United States more
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
importantly the bulk of this book seeks
 
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
to equi you with the knowledge and tools
 
00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
necessary to combat The burgeoning
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
Tyranny cuz it's coming the time to act
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
is now the power to change the course of
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
our future lies within our
 
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
grasp so this is what it would look like
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
this is your scenario the price
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
basically of submission it took barely a
 
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
decade for the world they knew to
 
00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
crumble after a series of planned
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
economic crises and the rise of
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.750 align:start position:0%
our well we're pretty close to time
amazing

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
okay um so House Bill
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
1674 Keith did you fill out a
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
fine we're doing good on time I'm GNA
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
try not to ruin it okay great for the
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
record my name is Keith Ammon represent
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 42 the towns of New
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
Boston lineboro and Mount
 
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
Vernon and honorable members of the
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
committee I am introducing House Bill
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
167 4 relative to establishing the New
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal tender act and
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
establishing a state bullion
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
depository so this bill does three
 
01:05:08.349 --> 01:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
things uh and I want to say this is a
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
novel bill this this uh approach has not
 
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
been tried in recent memory in the state
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
so uh this is not one of the perennial
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
bills that come before our committee but
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
it's a a new a new
 
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
bill and uh My Philosophy is that a bill
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
is just a
 
01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
conversation until and unless the
 
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
governor signs it into law so I think
 
01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
you'll hear some uh pros and cons about
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
this bill uh and I know the committee
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
will be open-minded uh and and I think
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
you'll hear some new information that
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
that we may not have heard before the
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
bill does three things it
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
establishes gold and Sil silver as legal
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
tender uh other states have done
 
01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
that it it uh suggests uh politely to
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer to set up a state
 
01:06:00.319 --> 01:06:02.269 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer to set up a state
bullion

01:06:02.269 --> 01:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
bullion
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
depository and at least one state has
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
already done that that's Texas and a few
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
others are proposing this
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
idea and then the third thing which is
 
01:06:14.589 --> 01:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
uh what made me interested in this
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
concept is it uh allows for the issuance
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
of digital tokens that are backed by the
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
bullion on deposit it and when you think
 
01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
about uh gold and silver have been
 
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
valuable for 5,000 years nobody disputes
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
that gold and silver has value and will
 
01:06:36.269 --> 01:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
very likely continue to have
 
01:06:39.269 --> 01:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
value and uh over time it it keeps up
 
01:06:39.279 --> 01:06:40.470 align:start position:0%
value and uh over time it it keeps up
with

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
inflation uh and we know we've
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
experienced some inflation recently but
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
if you if you tokenize
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
it and you allow it to be tradable on
 
01:06:53.069 --> 01:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
the internet now all of a sudden instead
 
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
of carrying around gold or trying to
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
physically trade the gold you're trading
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
a representation of the ownership of
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
that gold and that token can operate 247
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
it can operate globally it can operate
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
through space and time which physical
 
01:07:14.589 --> 01:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
gold cannot and so the idea would be the
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
state treasurer would be responsible for
 
01:07:20.589 --> 01:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
overseeing potentially Contracting out
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
to a third
 
01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
party uh the over s it of the Boolean
 
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
depository and making sure that audits
 
01:07:31.269 --> 01:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
regular audits of that bullan depository
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
match up with the tokens that are
 
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
issued um and so you know one concern
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
might be that more tokens will be issued
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
then there is gold on deposits but with
 
01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
something called proof of reserves on
 
01:07:47.269 --> 01:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
the blockchain you can make sure that
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
that's Ironclad that that never happens
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh which would uh give trust uh to the
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
whole the whole system
 
01:07:58.269 --> 01:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
one other aspect that's interesting is
 
01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's possible to that this could be
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
self-funding and be a source of revenue
 
01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
state and I think we're GNA there's
 
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
going to be some experts coming behind
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
me that can explain this in more detail
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
but with the Advent of something called
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
a smart
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
contract it can be programmed into that
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
token that every time it changes hands
 
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
uh a small transaction fee can be
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
automatically uh you know deducted from
 
01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
the total could be a half a percent or
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
something very small but over time every
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
time those tokens tra trade hands it
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
would transfer a little bit of that
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
ownership to the state and make the
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
depository self-funding and
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
potentially if it was uh happening on a
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
global scale that could be a significant
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
source of revenue for the state so um
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's a big
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
idea um I ask that you give it
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
consideration and uh you know maybe some
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
parts are things we we can act on and
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
some parts need work and I know this
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
committee does a good job of uh slicing
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
and dicing up bills pretty good so uh
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
please please be open-minded that's my
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
request so I I'm not going to take
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
questions because I I uh I think the
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
questions that you have will will come
 
01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
behind me and I'm concerned about the
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
time I've already taken up eight minutes
 
01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the only question I have is
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
should I even ask any questions or can
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
we just wait till we just get back in
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
the committee and do it then well
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
because I've got a lot of questions I'm
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
going to I'm going to
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully not take question I have a
 
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
question about the purp I have some
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
questions about the purpose of the bill
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
that I think should be answered by the
 
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor not experts on blockchain
 
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
anyone who is testifying I'm sorry
 
01:09:40.349 --> 01:09:40.359 align:start position:0%
anyone who is testifying if they are not
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
interested in taking questions that is
 
01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
their prerogative I can't force them to
 
01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.390 align:start position:0%
their prerogative I can't force them to
take

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
questions so I can all I urge is this
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
bill is just the beginning we're just
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
getting our feet wet we have a long way
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
to go as you know we're going to put
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
this to subcommittee and there was going
 
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of work on this bill okay
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
but I I understand that we all have lots
 
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
and lots of questions and evidently I
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
got tons and tons of cards here and I'm
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
sure there'll be somebody in this pile
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
who will be willing to take your
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
question but I cannot force people to
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
testify okay but will somebody test will
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
may I follow up a question to you Mr
 
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
chairman will somebody be test ifying
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
regarding the purpose purposes of the
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
bill rather than the technicalities yes
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
I I got the purpose pretty clearly from
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
represent amm that is but I have
 
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
question they would like to use the our
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
blockchain concept technology to use it
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
in a way that people can pay their bills
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
or use an exchange using gold and
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
silver and I have questions about did I
 
01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
get it right and I just heard this just
 
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
now and I heard that so I I I think
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
we're pretty straightforward on what the
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to do it's just
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
whether you whether you buy into it or
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
not is another story so let's
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
listen Okay um I have a fair amount of
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
cards and people in support of this bill
 
01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
but what I want to do is I have several
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
cards that they didn't say they're for
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
or against so I'm going to just get
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
through that crowd and then we can hear
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
from everybody who in strong support of
 
01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
the bill so first I have is Katherine

Association

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for allowing me
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
to testify for the record my name is
 
01:11:45.629 --> 01:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
Katherine heck and I represent the New
 
01:11:47.629 --> 01:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association or the
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
234 cities and towns in New Hampshire
 
01:11:54.189 --> 01:11:54.199 align:start position:0%
happy new to you all and welcome back um
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
the reason um I am here today is because
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
I have spoken with the prime sponsor on
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
the bill and we had some concerns around
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
whether this was mandated language that
 
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities comply with accepting
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
silver and gold as legal tender or
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
whether it's a May and it's enabling
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
legislation and after speaking with the
 
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor we have identified several areas
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
of the bill that could be cleaned up
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
because our concerns are that silver and
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
gold are not um currently federally
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
recognized legal tender they're not
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
currently accepted at local banks and
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
they're traded on the Futures Market or
 
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
comx so with that the price changes and
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
it fluctuates daily and our concern that
 
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
we can't seem to cure for in addition to
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
some of our internal controls around how
 
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
we would Safeguard these dollars or how
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
we would use them in our day-to-day
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
operations are really around how we
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
would value that in our books because
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
it's much like going um on vacation to a
 
01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
foreign country and using the exchange
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
rate especially if it's physical silver
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
and gold bullion and that price can V
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
vary every single day so how would we
 
01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
would cure for that in our our tax you
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
know in taxation when we need to protect
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
every dollar which has a US dollar value
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
so that was our main concern around the
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
bill in addition to some of the storage
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
and some of the deposit issues if the
 
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
state treasur is the only depository for
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
us to accept that that could be up to
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
two two and a half hours for some of our
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
cities and towns to get to and we're re
 
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
re ired by law to deposit $1,500 or more
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
on a weekly W within 48 Hours of receipt
 
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
so we had some really logistical
 
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
concerns around the bill on the digital
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
side well that certainly alleviates our
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
physical um internal controls around
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
that commodity it would be really around
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
again how do we cure for needing to
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
justify dollar for dollar and having
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
almost like that foreign exchange rate
 
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
um occurring within our Municipal
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
Financial accounting on a regular basis
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to address those
 
01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
concerns but I look forward to working
 
01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor um and the committee
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
and subcommittee on any issues
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities may have moving forward
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you we do have a oh you
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
just no it's a question
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
question the last page you want to pull
 
01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.709 align:start position:0%
question the last page you want to pull
it

01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
close the last page of the bill uh
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
indicates overall there would be a
 
01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
significant increase in local
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures starting in FY
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
2025 that's correct because currently as
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
the bill reads without any amendments or
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
modifications someone could pay their
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
property tax um as the bill reads
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
currently in in so or gold bullion and
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
therefore we would not only have to
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
create highly technical safeguards
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
around the physical asset right itself
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
um we would also have to have additional
 
01:14:53.629 --> 01:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
internal controls we would have to hire
 
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
specialist to help us understand when to
 
01:14:58.030 --> 01:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
trade the gold or silver to to not lose
 
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
any dollar Ford dooll value because
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
right now gold is down $7 today so if I
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
bought it yesterday or someone paid
 
01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
their taxes yesterday because it's not
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
based on the US dollar at the moment um
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
which is the the current disconnect it's
 
01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
like that foreign exchange rate so those
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
would be our costs in trying to cure for
 
01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
that as well as hire the appropriate
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
expertise that we would need um at the
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
municipal level
 
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
any other questions see none thank you
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
very much thank you okay next is
 
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:34.600 align:start position:0%

with your Keen Keen is your yeah yeah
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%

Administration

01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and good morning
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Keen
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
M Wong uh tax policy Council of New
 
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
Administration um we the Department of
 
01:16:16.629 --> 01:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue was asked to prepare a fiscal
 
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
note on the spill and we prepared it and
 
01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:20.679 align:start position:0%
what I'm handing out around is a uh
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal noqu guide of the uh the f going
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
to be prepared um the department does
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
not have a position on this bill um the
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
the the reason why we are here today is
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
just to um sort of bring to the
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
attention of the um of the com committee
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
that um that some of the concerns that
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
the department has on the bill
 
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
specifically in regards to um
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
the for the the currency not the
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
currency but the exchange rates that's
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
being used used between the functional
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
currency and the US dollar uh when the
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
when the business unit is trying to pays
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
taxes there is language in the bill that
 
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
refers to uh that the the business unit
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
are able to maintain their books in
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
certain functional currency and then has
 
01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
the option to pay taxes in that
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
functional currency or to convert it to
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
to US Dollars um so the uh the the
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
department feels that there is some kind
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
of maybe some kind of tightening of
 
01:17:27.629 --> 01:17:27.639 align:start position:0%
language might be helpful to to indicate
 
01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
how that's that's being managed because
 
01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
uh the department is concerned with um
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
the that the performance of the or the
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
financial performance of uh of a
 
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
business unit within one functional
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
currency may not be fully represented
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the full taxable period um if
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's kept in one functional currency and
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
then being converted back back and forth
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh throughout the throughout the period
 
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
um and then raises the concerns of okay
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
um is there going to be uh a currency
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
exchange gain or currency exchange loss
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
that occurs during that conversion and
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
how that is recognized I believe the
 
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
language current language in the bill is
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
that there is no recognition of U of tax
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
impact um which might um which might be
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
in conflict with uh with how uh the
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
federal government treats the um the
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
exchange transactions
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
um and essentially the other concerns
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
that we have is just uh may not be as as
 
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
significant probably it's just more of a
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh administrative cost concern in terms
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
of um if taxpayers are will be going to
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
use um species gold or silver um we
 
01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
might incre additional cost in terms of
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
security transportation in terms of
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
trying to um secure those
 
01:18:55.629 --> 01:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
um assets when when it's being paid to
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
the Dr um the the rest of the um the
 
01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
rest of my comments will be in the um in
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
the notes that I passed out in more
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
detail um and um and I'm happy to to
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
take any questions and also if um if the
 
01:19:14.669 --> 01:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
the committee wish to work with the Dr
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to you know figure
 
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
out um areas of our concerns and trying
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
to alleviate that um and we be happy to
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
to work with the committee as
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
well so so I have a question um I'm sort
 
01:19:30.189 --> 01:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
of hearing this whole issue is exchange
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
and and and at what day they pay the
 
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
bill based upon what the gold is worth
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
that day right so I'm thinking how now
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
corporations International corporations
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
are struggling when it comes with
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
currency problems and when they pay
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
their bills and when they just so that
 
01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
that I could see that if there was all
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
of a sudden one day the current this
 
01:19:54.510 --> 01:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
some other stock was currency was worth
 
01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
a lot more that they suddenly would
 
01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
flood making their payments and then and
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
then other times they wouldn't and then
 
01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
they have to make that decision well how
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
much penalty will'll take if I don't pay
 
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:07.719 align:start position:0%
on time so I was wondering how much of a
 
01:20:11.229 --> 01:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
problem does Dr have with that kind of
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh currency fluctuation issues uh that's
 
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
a very good question I right now we
 
01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
don't really have any kind of issues
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
with that because uh firstly the um the
 
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are keeping the records in US
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
Dollars although they they might have
 
01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
transactions abroad um their books in in
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the US is in in US currency um and
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
then if they do have any kind of Foreign
 
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
Exchange transactions um any kind of
 
01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
gain uh from that for let's say if they
 
01:20:45.629 --> 01:20:45.639 align:start position:0%
were trading in foreign currency the
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
gains in in the foreign currency would
 
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
should be a taxable um item and should
 
01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
be reported as some kind of a as a gain
 
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
that's reported on
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
oh yeah interesting
 
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay okay so just the price of gold
 
01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
might be effect whether they're
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
profitability profit interesting because
 
01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:07.639 align:start position:0%
because a taxpayer might see might be
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
reporting their um the activities in in
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
one currency and or in in one commodity
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
and then um when it comes times to when
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
it comes time to report their us numbers
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
they might just wait until all the
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
opportune time say oh yeah now the
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
currency exch exchange rate is really
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
low let's convert it to US Dollars and
 
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
just report that there you go a little
 
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
bit of scheming going on I assume yeah
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very
 
01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
much all right uh last Brandon uh Garren
 
01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
Justice and uh first to seen you this
 
01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
year and I assume we will see you some
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
more going on with this
 
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
future this the rest rest of this month
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
and uh Happy New
 
01:21:59.470 --> 01:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
Year Mr ladies and gentlemen my name is
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
Brandon I
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
am I am a senior Assistant Attorney
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
General also the chief of the consumer
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
protection and anti trust Bureau at the
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Justice um
 
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice takes no
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
position on hb1
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
1674 but uh we flagged in a fiscal note
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of dueling concerns that we
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
have with the bill as currently drafted
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
I thought it would be prudent to expand
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
on both of those concerns today uh so
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
those concerns are you know overly Broad
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
and unclear enforcement Authority that
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
is assigned to the Attorney General's
 
01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
office under the bill as currently
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
drafted and as a result of that and very
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
much related um the potential for a
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
significant fiscal impact on the
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice if this bill were
 
01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:43.719 align:start position:0%
passed in its current form so I I'll
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
start with the the first issue which is
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
the overly broad enforcement Authority
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
typically statutes that anticipate the
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
Attorney General whether it's the
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Bureau or another
 
01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
division of the AG's office enforcing a
 
01:22:59.950 --> 01:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
statute um they have specific
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement Authority as to what
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
provisions of a statute we enforce and
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
how we would go about enforc enforcing
 
01:23:09.390 --> 01:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
that so the statute that you all hear
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
about most frequently is New Hampshire's
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act so I'll use that
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
as an example under the consumer
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
protection act if anyone engaged in
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
trade or Commerce in the state were to
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
engage in unfair deceptive Acts or
 
01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
practices as specifically
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
um defined by that statute the consumer
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
protection antitrust Bureau has the
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
ability to go into court um seek an
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
injunction to stop that behavior to seek
 
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
specific civil penalties to punish that
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
behavior to seek restitution for those
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
that are grieved and also to bring
 
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
criminal charges if
 
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate um this bill as currently
 
01:23:44.669 --> 01:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
worded just very broadly assigns
 
01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the entire Bill to the
 
01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office without any
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
specification as to what specific
 
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
sections of this Bill we would enforce
 
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
or how we would go about enforcing it if
 
01:23:58.510 --> 01:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
we were to receive a a complaint from
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
anybody about a potential violation and
 
01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
that's really problematic that you the
 
01:24:06.189 --> 01:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
way that we approach enforcement of all
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the the numerous statutes that are
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
assigned to our office folks submit
 
01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
complaints to us whether it's the
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Bureau or any other
 
01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
Division and our process is to look to
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
see whether the facts that are alleged
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
in the complaint um specifically allege
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
a violation of any statute that we are
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
tasked with enforcing and the way this
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
is currently drafted I mean there are
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
certain sections of this bill which you
 
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
know you could look at and you know
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
determine for example you know there's a
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on certain tax liability in
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances there's a a
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on individual's ability to
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
compel versus not compel others to do
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
certain things so like step one we could
 
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
look at that and say you know yes there
 
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
is or isn't a violation of something
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
that we enforce but then
 
01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
our calculus is what can we do about it
 
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
as the Department of Justice what tools
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
has the legislature given us to remedy a
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
violation of a statute it's completely
 
01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
unclear and undefined by this statute so
 
01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:05.719 align:start position:0%
any action that if we were to take it we
 
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
would basically have to guess and say
 
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know well under the consumer
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
protection act we're able to you know
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
seek civil penalties for example so
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can seek civil penalties here
 
01:25:17.629 --> 01:25:17.639 align:start position:0%
anybody who we attempted to seek civil
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
penalties against would be able to say
 
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
this statute doesn't give you the
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
authority to do that and they would
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
likely have a compelling
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
argument so you know there is three
 
01:25:29.229 --> 01:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
sections in this bill where the Attorney
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
General's enforcement authorities
 
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
specifically identified one is just
 
01:25:35.109 --> 01:25:35.119 align:start position:0%
broad overarching enforcement of the
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
entire um bill which I think is really
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
problematic for a number of reasons one
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
of which is you know there are a number
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
of sections of this bill that you know
 
01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
like the establishment of a depository
 
01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:47.719 align:start position:0%
that potentially we would be responsible
 
01:25:49.629 --> 01:25:49.639 align:start position:0%
for overseeing the enforcement of just
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
the establishment of a depository that
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
is well outside the ordinary law
 
01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:55.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement role that the Attorney
 
01:25:58.750 --> 01:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
General typically plays but there are a
 
01:26:01.629 --> 01:26:01.639 align:start position:0%
couple of more specific sections um that
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
assign attorney general enforcement
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
which I I highlight for you and have you
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
know additional concerns on um I'll
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
point to looks like Roman numeral three
 
01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
under Section 5 d10 conflicts of
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
interest the bill as currently drafted
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
would have the any violation um of an
 
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
allegation of any person overseeing this
 
01:26:26.189 --> 01:26:26.199 align:start position:0%
depository who had a conflict of
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
interest in administering that
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility um this bill would assign
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General to determine um
 
01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
fines or other legal penalties
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
determined by the attorney generals that
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
we could use in potentially removing
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
somebody from that position the
 
01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
overseeing of folks that are in certain
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
positions in this case it would be State
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
positions is certainly uh you know can
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
be an attorney general function but here
 
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
this this would be an enormous
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility anytime anybody were to
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
file a complaint with the AG's office
 
01:26:59.229 --> 01:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
and say anybody who's overseeing this
 
01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
depository has a conflict of interest of
 
01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
any sort we would have an obligation to
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
then go in and investigate that and that
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
that sort of gets to the second point
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
which is there's a potential for
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
significant fiscal impact on the
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
department in order to carry out that
 
01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
role um we would need potentially and
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard to Define because it's so
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
Broad and it's unclear what sort of um
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
complaints and what sort of obligations
 
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
we would have but it's easy to see a
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
world where this could result in
 
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
significant increase in the number of
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
complaints that we receive um which
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
could result in the need for additional
 
01:27:31.149 --> 01:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
paralegals to review them attorneys to
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
review them and investigators to go out
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
and investigate these things in order to
 
01:27:36.189 --> 01:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
determine whether there has been a
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
violation that we can enforce and so the
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
other section that you know has attorney
 
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
general enforcement which I think may be
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
the most problematic of the three um is
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 4 under Section 5 D20
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
confiscations requisitions seizures and
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
other actions void so at the very end of
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
the section under Roman numeral 4 states
 
01:27:59.229 --> 01:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
that the depository shall refer any
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
matter relating to an action described
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
by subsection a to the ad Journey
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
general for
 
01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
resolution and so I I have a couple of
 
01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
concerns here it references subsection a
 
01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
um any action described by subsection a
 
01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:15.719 align:start position:0%
I have looked at this section at least
 
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
five times to try to figure out which
 
01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
subsection a that is specifically
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
referring to and I don't know um I think
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
that there is a significant lack of
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
clarity in a section that is supposed to
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
be limited to a very specific subsection
 
01:28:33.109 --> 01:28:33.119 align:start position:0%
of this bill um and the reader cannot
 
01:28:35.229 --> 01:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
easily Define which of the sub many
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
subsection A's contained in this bill
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General would be able to
 
01:28:44.590 --> 01:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
resolve disputes under um which gets to
 
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
the the second problem with the use of
 
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
the word um they'd be referred to the
 
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general for resolution
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
resolution is an incredibly Brad broad
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
term um that could be interpreted to
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
mean mediation um alternative dispute
 
01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
resolution of various different kinds um
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted to mean enforcement
 
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
could be inter determined to mean
 
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecution I mean there are
 
01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
many ways to resolve a dispute but this
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
bill does not provide enough Clarity for
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General to understand what
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility it has under this
 
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
specific subsection it's I think all of
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
that collectively has the potential to
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
significantly increase the the fiscal
 
01:29:24.030 --> 01:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
impact on the doj which would
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
necessitate I think potentially
 
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
significant additional resources to
 
01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
carry this out but I I also think that
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
even if those resources were provided
 
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
likely there would be multiple
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
challenges in ter determining what
 
01:29:37.229 --> 01:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
specific enforcement Authority we have
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
if this were passed as currently written
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
and happy to take any questions that
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.629 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%

Russo and I asked Chris better five
 
01:30:00.370 --> 01:30:00.380 align:start position:0%
minutes can you do it in three two to

minutes can you do it in three two to
[Music]

01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%

University of Chicago thank you for
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
inviting me to testify this morning
 
01:31:06.430 --> 01:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
about the New Hampshire sound money act
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
if enacted the ACT would declare gold
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
and Silver's legal tender it would
 
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
establish a state depository for gold
 
01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
and silver bullion and enable a digital
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
currency for Bullion back digital
 
01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
payments I hope to inform the Committees
 
01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
that deliberates over this bill for
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
creating alternative to the US dollar
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
and for sake of discussion I'll refer to
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
this alternative as the granite coin
 
01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
after your great
 
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
state my expert testimony can be
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
summarized by three key points first the
 
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
dollar has lost most of its value since
 
01:31:37.629 --> 01:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
the US left the gold standard in
 
01:31:40.189 --> 01:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
1933 ultimately the erosion of the
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
Dollar's value was due to unsustainable
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
deficits and debt incurred by the
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
federal government over the past 100 or
 
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
so years and that was sometimes enabled
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
by the federal reserve's easy money
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
policy policies last week the US
 
01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
national debt reached an all-time high
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
of $34
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
trillion the Congressional budget office
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
projects that the national debt will
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
continue to soar under current law
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
unless Congress acts to restore fiscal
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility the Dollar's purchasing
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
power will continue to deteriorate over
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
time my second point is that a granite
 
01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:13.400 align:start position:0%
coin could offer New Hampshire citizens
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
a hedge against inflation by design a
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
granite coin would be fully backed by a
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
fixed quantity of underlying species
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
like gold or silver for example one
 
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
Granite coin might be defined as one
 
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
gram of gold the consumer purchasing
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
power of a granite coin would fluctuate
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
as been uh pointed out earlier in this
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
hearing as gold rose or fell in
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
value but if the granite coin was widely
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
adopted as money then competitive market
 
01:32:39.629 --> 01:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
forces would tend to stabilize its
 
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
consumer purchasing power over time my
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
third point is however a commodity money
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
is not itself a panaca for inflation the
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
market forces that tend to stabilize
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
consumer prices might take years or in
 
01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
some cases even decades to fully operate
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
and only if the coin was adopted as
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
money moreover commodity money could
 
01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:02.119 align:start position:0%
incurs own economic costs uh as with all
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
policy choices choosing a monetary
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
standard involves tradeoffs between
 
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
imperfect Alternatives as you consider
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
the potential costs and benefits of a
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
granite coin two stylized examples might
 
01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
be helpful to show how a commodity
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
standard to work in principle I'll just
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
stick to one of them because I know
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
we're limited on time this is the
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
example being my prepared testimony
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
suppose there's a decline in the
 
01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
Public's demand for money um say there's
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
a local recession and so declining
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
incomes lead to people choosing to hold
 
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
less money that might reduce the value
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
or the purchasing power of granite coins
 
01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
below their non-monetary value for
 
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
example their value in the creation of
 
01:33:42.510 --> 01:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
computer chips or jewelry the
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
interesting thing about competitive
 
01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
market forces in the case of a commodity
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
standard is that firms or individuals
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
would then take their excess Granite
 
01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
coins excess in terms of what they Des
 
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
desire to hold not in terms of how much
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
species on deposit and redeem them for
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
species and in doing so there's this
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
nice type of equilibrium in which the
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
declining level of granite coin in the
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
economy would tend to restore its
 
01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
purchasing power back to where it
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
was uh so in addition to considering
 
01:34:11.109 --> 01:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
these sorts of costs and benefits of
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
creating a granite coin uh I'd really
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to consider how the
 
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
granite coin would fit into the broader
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
Federal regulatory framework and again I
 
01:34:20.189 --> 01:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
know we're Limited in time so I'll just
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
very briefly mention uh there's
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
considerations around how this would fit
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
into Federal anti-money laundering laws
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
there's concerns or at least
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
considerations around what this would be
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
considered at the federal level and who
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
would regulate it is it a currency is it
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
a commodity is it a investment
 
01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
contract uh could Granite coin be held
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
by people uh aside from individuals
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
could it be held by Banks or money
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
transmitters or asset managers uh again
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
I don't have time time to address these
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
in detail but they're important things I
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
urge you to consider as you you continue
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
to deliberate um and finally I hope that
 
01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
this hearing serves as a wakeup call to
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
my friends in Washington DC A Century of
 
01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
inflation has made
 
01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
Americans skeptical of uh the United
 
01:35:06.510 --> 01:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
States dollars and you know you know
 
01:35:07.950 --> 01:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
from my history I I sort of have a
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
professional obligation to be a partisan
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
for the US dollar but uh in this case I
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
think I can appreciate why people are
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
skeptical and so I POs to my friends in
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
Washington DC will we fairly compete for
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
the space in the Wallace of the
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
residents and citizens of New Hampshire
 
01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
by restoring fiscal responsibility at
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
the federal level or will we return to
 
01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
the Crooked politics of financial
 
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
repression and inflationary Finance the
 
01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
American people patiently await our
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
answer thank you again for the
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
invitation to speak I pleas please to
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Gibbs has a
 
01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you um I'm honestly
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
not sure that the witness is the right
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
person to answer these questions but I'm
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
going to uh ask them as best I can and
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
may I ask three questions three
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you are they short
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
brief simple questions I'll make them as
 
01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
brief no big story along each one right
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
just yes I'll make them as brief as I
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
can thank you Mr
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
chairman uh first question is um are New
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens clamoring to card
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
around gold and silver to pay their
 
01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.510 align:start position:0%
around gold and silver to pay their
bills

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
ma'am I think you're exactly right I'm
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
not the right person to answer that
 
01:36:26.109 --> 01:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
question I can talk to you as an
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
academic as an expert in monetary
 
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
economics I can tell you that uh
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
historically one of the costs of a gold
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
standard commodity or any sort of specic
 
01:36:37.870 --> 01:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
monetary standard is that uh there's
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
wear and tear on the physical goal
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's a cost uh it's costly to try to
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh as you describe card around gold and
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
silver I think one of the potential
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
Promises of this legislation is that
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
people would not be cardig and gold and
 
01:36:53.229 --> 01:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
silver they'd have a app on their phone
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
a digital wallet in which they could
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
exchange on the blockchain uh quite
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
costlessly uh uh uh claims on gold held
 
01:37:05.470 --> 01:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
on deposit and that leads me to my
 
01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:06.430 align:start position:0%
on deposit and that leads me to my
second

01:37:06.430 --> 01:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
question uh which is apparently um these
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh digital this digital currency based
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
on gold and silver is not clear to me
 
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
from the bill uh who issue this digital
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
currency so my question is why would we
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
want to trust a digital currency which
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
could be issued by private persons or
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
organizations uh which would the
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
currency would supposedly be backed by
 
01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
gold and silver uh which is in the
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
possession of these private persons uh
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
why would we want to trust that more
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
than the dollar backed by the full faith
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
and credit of the United States of
 
01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
America representative I think it's a
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
very interesting question I I'll again
 
01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
just say that um I did not draft the
 
01:37:58.990 --> 01:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
bill but on my plain English reading of
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
it and maybe this can be clarified in
 
01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:03.159 align:start position:0%
subsequent amendments the coin would be
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
issued by the state government um you
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
raay a much more fundamental and quite
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
interesting question about historically
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
why were people willing as they were uh
 
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
to trust the money issued by private
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
Banks uh that were claimed to be backed
 
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
by gold and silver um one one reason why
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
historically people were able to trust
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
in those promises say you have a bank
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
note issued by a private institution
 
01:38:30.589 --> 01:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
that's claimed to backed by some amount
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
of gold or silver why are you willing to
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
trust that that money is actually there
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
that underlying species there well
 
01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
because it can be redeemed on demand
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
people would regularly take their Bank
 
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
notes to their um uh local banks and uh
 
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
redeem in terms of the gold or silver
 
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
value that's a type of Market discipline
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
that helps a system like this work and
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
again my plan English reading the bill
 
01:38:52.589 --> 01:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
suggest that that Redemption would be
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
allowable under the wall if this was to
 
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
pass thank you I'll reserve my third
 
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
question for another witness thank you
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
ma'am thank you very
 
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
much and and your your testimony yeah we
 
01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:08.229 align:start position:0%
much and and your your testimony yeah we
passed

01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
it it's this one this one here you got
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
this you got it okay okay all right now
 
01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.430 align:start position:0%
this you got it okay okay all right now
represent

01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
Granger I apologize is not calling you
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
sooner but I'm not a co-sponsor so it's
 
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay no but oh theoretically we we
 
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
always supposed to take
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
reps first because you we know you have
 
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
to go on to another your own committee
 
01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
and so we're not supposed to hold you up
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
in here so I I appreciate it
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
um so uh thank you Mr chair and members
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is
 
01:39:45.149 --> 01:39:45.159 align:start position:0%
representative Granger I'm uh here
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
representing straford District 2 I'm not
 
01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of this bill uh because I
 
01:39:51.709 --> 01:39:51.719 align:start position:0%
but I like the bill and you guys were
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
talking about cbdcs earlier this is a
 
01:39:56.669 --> 01:39:56.679 align:start position:0%
much better alternative to cbdcs if you
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
if you if you want a digital currency
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
that has a lot of the benefits of a cbdc
 
01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh when it comes to convenience and
 
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
everything else but you don't want to
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
have a federal bank uh pulling the purse
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
strings and uh destroying your savings
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
by printing money and you want it to be
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit more tied to reality uh
 
01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
then I believe that this is a very good
 
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
alternative uh so I want to talk a
 
01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
little bit about uh Reserve current over
 
01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
history right now the US dollar is a
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
reserve currency um and what a reserve
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
currency is it's basically a currency
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
that is used to back other currencies so
 
01:40:34.990 --> 01:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
if you have a country it's a smaller
 
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
country you can take us doll and you can
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
store them in reserve and then you can
 
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
print your own money redeemable on
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
demand for US dollars for instance and
 
01:40:47.229 --> 01:40:47.239 align:start position:0%
the US dollar used to be uh backed by
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
gold as was mentioned previously uh it
 
01:40:52.270 --> 01:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
currently is not uh as a result of that
 
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's uh gone crazy and we've had some
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
significant issues with inflation and uh
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
the decimation of savings accounts and
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
all the problems that uh ensue from that
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
where uh regular people who are
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
incapable of uh making an actual return
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
on their savings from a bank uh they're
 
01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
forced in order for their retirement or
 
01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
for saving for whatever and they need to
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
go on play on the stock market because
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
if you put your money in the bank and
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's only earning 1 and a half% interest
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
but inflation is higher than that that
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
means that you're not actually saving
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
any money you're losing you're losing
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
money by keeping it in the bank and uh
 
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
that that's a serious problem and now we
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
have a large population of of New
 
01:41:34.189 --> 01:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as the rest of the
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
country young people who are incapable
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
of affording houses uh they cannot get a
 
01:41:40.589 --> 01:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
loan to buy a house and they wouldn't be
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
able to afford their mortgage and this
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
was the case even in 2019 this is before
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
anything like that anything that
 
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
happened in 2020 would have changed that
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
um and we also have a big problem where
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh elderly people are incapable of
 
01:41:54.589 --> 01:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
paying for their own retirement and it
 
01:41:56.589 --> 01:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
forces them to depend on Social Security
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
and Social Security it's it's it's not
 
01:42:01.149 --> 01:42:01.159 align:start position:0%
being keeping track with inflation
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
because the dollar keeps losing its
 
01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
value faster than we can we can save and
 
01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
so gold is a historical means to prevent
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
all these problems but I wanted to make
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
a point on reserve currencies more
 
01:42:19.629 --> 01:42:19.639 align:start position:0%
specifically so I got several Reserve
 
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
currencies here as you guys have a
 
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
Graphic that shows how long they last
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
before it doesn't quite work anymore uh
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
so the Portuguese real um that was
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
around in the uh that started in the uh
 
01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:32.709 align:start position:0%
around in the uh that started in the uh
mid

01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
mid
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
1400s um that was used for about 80
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
years before it was supplanted by the
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
Spanish raer the Spanish dollar and that
 
01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
you might know that that those were the
 
01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
Pieces Of Eight that the colonists used
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh that one had a really good run that
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
lasted about 110 years before getting uh
 
01:42:48.510 --> 01:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
replaced by the Dutch Gilder and uh the
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
Dutch Gilder lasted about 80 years and
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
then it was replaced with the French
 
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
Fran and that one had a had a better run
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
than most it had 95 was kind of mediocre
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
before it was replaced by the pound
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
sterling um there's some questions as to
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
when exactly the pound sterling stopped
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
being a reserve currency um it lost most
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
of its value in World War I but it the
 
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
it definitely died at the end in uh 1944
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
um it was uh that's when uh the Breton
 
01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
Woods there was the Breton Woods
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
agreement and all that jazz but that's
 
01:43:19.709 --> 01:43:19.719 align:start position:0%
when the US dollar became a world
 
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
currency um and so depending on how you
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
measure the start of the US Dollar's
 
01:43:25.709 --> 01:43:25.719 align:start position:0%
reign as the world's Reserve currency
 
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
we've either been doing it for 104 years
 
01:43:30.589 --> 01:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
or 80 years uh that's a pretty good run
 
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
but we should expect that that will not
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
last very long because historically
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
Reserve currencies kind of don't last
 
01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
much longer than that and we're started
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
seeing the uh economic throws that sort
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
of come through when a currency is not
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
going to last very long we're already
 
01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
seeing competition from bricks uh the uh
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration keeps referring to
 
01:43:49.679 --> 01:43:51.470 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration keeps referring to
dollarization

01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
dollarization
 
01:43:53.229 --> 01:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
um these are all just fancy ways of
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
saying we know that the the show is over
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
but we need to sort of sell it and find
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
a away where people don't panic uh
 
01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
because the dollar is it's not in good
 
01:44:05.950 --> 01:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
it's not in good shape um takes a couple
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
generations for people to squander uh
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the fundamentals that made the
 
01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
currency a good candidate for a reserve
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
currency in the first place I do not
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
think that the US dollar is going to
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
last very long but if if such a
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
situation occurs where the US dollar
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
just dies or uh the plan to Institute a
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
cbdc fails and people reject the new
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
cbdc or whatever the case may be it
 
01:44:29.950 --> 01:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
would be really nice for New Hampshire
 
01:44:32.669 --> 01:44:32.679 align:start position:0%
to have a backup so we can still have
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
government services run we could still
 
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
have uh towns and municipalities able to
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
provide services by having a currency
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
that is backed by gold gold doesn't die
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
gold has been a reserve currency for
 
01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
Millennia it has there there's no such
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
thing as you know they had in order to
 
01:44:54.589 --> 01:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
make the dollar or the or gold die as a
 
01:44:56.589 --> 01:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
as a currency whether legally or not you
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
know there's questions as to whether
 
01:44:59.950 --> 01:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
legally counts as a currency but
 
01:45:02.589 --> 01:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
economically speaking it making gold no
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
longer valid a currency you need to be
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
able to find some way to make gold out
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
of nothing so right now if you have a
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
dollar you can or the Federal Reserve
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
they can go through their processes and
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
they can just make new money like that
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
um but the expansion of the monetary
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
base means that whenever they do that
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
they're not actually creating more value
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the economy they're just decreasing
 
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
the value of all the existing dollars so
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
you can't really do that with gold maybe
 
01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
Fusion reactors in the future will be
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
able to do it I don't know but as of
 
01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
right now it has a pretty good track
 
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
record and I think that gold will last a
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
very very long time into the future as
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
it's lasted a long time into the past so
 
01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
we're due and so I think that this uh
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
legislation is very important
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
specifically because it isn't just a
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
make gold legal currency bill uh it's
 
01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
also make it use usable in the modern
 
01:45:54.910 --> 01:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
day bill so if if you just had a bill
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
that made gold legal currency and you
 
01:45:59.470 --> 01:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to buy something from Amazon you
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
would have to take some silver coins put
 
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
them in an envelope lick it put a stamp
 
01:46:06.270 --> 01:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
on it and then mail it to them and then
 
01:46:07.629 --> 01:46:07.639 align:start position:0%
they'd have to send you the product
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's obviously not workable in this
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
Modern Age so having some sort of
 
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
tokenization which uh allows you to
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
transfer ownership of the Gold without
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
having to physically move the gold
 
01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
itself is the Boon and that is exactly
 
01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
why paper currencies backed by gold were
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
so popular back in the day people didn't
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
want to carry around a jingling bag of
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
coins everywhere they went so they would
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
it was much more convenient to carry
 
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
around a piece of paper that is
 
01:46:36.430 --> 01:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
redeemable for gold at a bank and so um
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's basically what I have
 
01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
I'll take uh I I suppose I better not
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
take questions because it's not my bill
 
01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
but uh thank you very much I do remember
 
01:46:47.709 --> 01:46:47.719 align:start position:0%
the silver dollar the the silver paper
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
dollar yeah it wasn't that long ago
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you very much all right
 
01:46:55.790 --> 01:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
so I I have spoken to the treasure and
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
she's willing to come up and share a
 
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
little bit of given that this would be
 
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
under her statute of
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
authority and I thought maybe she would
 
01:47:08.830 --> 01:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
have some insights for us but if nothing
 
01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:10.109 align:start position:0%
have some insights for us but if nothing
else

01:47:10.109 --> 01:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
she'll tell us
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:23.390 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning thank you Mr
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and members of the committee
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh for the record State Treasurer Monica
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
mapelli I was not plan to testify
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
however I am prepared I was prepared for
 
01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:36.159 align:start position:0%
questions so uh that's the reason I'm
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
here but um you know based on um uh
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
chman uh request um what I am prepared
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
to to share is um first uh we we we take
 
01:47:53.229 --> 01:47:53.239 align:start position:0%
no position um on on this bill um uh we
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
will certainly follow the direction of
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature if if this bill were to
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
pass um so so this
 
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
proposal as uh represent am U mentioned
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
in the beginning appears to cover three
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
different topics so I'm going to try to
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
stay at a higher level and just focus at
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
a I guess um from what appears to impact
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
the treasury um directly so the first
 
01:48:19.310 --> 01:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
one is the uh the establishment of the
 
01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.950 align:start position:0%
one is the uh the establishment of the
depository

01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
depository
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
um so a depository will need to be um
 
01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
built in in in my opinion um currently
 
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
the treasury does not have the
 
01:48:31.229 --> 01:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to to hold gold silver
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
metal uh precious metals um so it will
 
01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
um a new facility will have to be built
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
and created uh and it will include that
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
and it will have to have the the
 
01:48:46.189 --> 01:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
elements needed for this type of
 
01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um security um um all of
 
01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
the different components um that will be
 
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
required to to maintain a facility like
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
this one um So based on our
 
01:48:59.910 --> 01:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of the bill that's not
 
01:49:01.390 --> 01:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
this bill does not appear to provide
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
funding for that initial uh facility and
 
01:49:07.390 --> 01:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
um this part of the bill this is this is
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
what appears to be the foundation of
 
01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
what this proposal um is uh is in our
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
view uh intending to do uh so with that
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh we are required to administer
 
01:49:22.149 --> 01:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
um this
 
01:49:24.669 --> 01:49:24.679 align:start position:0%
depository um currently the treasury
 
01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
does not have the resources for this we
 
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
will have to uh either hire staff and
 
01:49:32.109 --> 01:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
and and and what is needed to be able to
 
01:49:35.589 --> 01:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
run this uh this depository or we will
 
01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
have to contract with a third party
 
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
provider in order to do that um again um
 
01:49:44.189 --> 01:49:44.199 align:start position:0%
it does um this proposal appears to
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
establish ability or appears to provide
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
the ability to establish fees for the
 
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
storage withdrawal and transfer of
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
bullion um but it just does not appear
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
to um to provide the funding required
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
for an initial investment um to be able
 
01:50:02.589 --> 01:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
to again um establish the depository and
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
really launch this
 
01:50:08.189 --> 01:50:08.199 align:start position:0%
program um so so that would be again uh
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
the question how we will have to how we
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
would is unclear to us how we will um
 
01:50:15.550 --> 01:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
implement this program according to what
 
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
what this proposal is um is describing
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
um and then the Salvage of the
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
electronic currency backed by gold and
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
silver um that's clearly a a new um it
 
01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
will be a new an Initiative for the
 
01:50:31.229 --> 01:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
straight treasury so we will have to
 
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
have the resources um needed to be able
 
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
to run an operation like that um we
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
would either have to again hire experts
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh to assistance with this um other
 
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
departments will have to uh also provide
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
some guidance Department of Information
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
Technology uh Department of Justice will
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
have to be involved uh to to um assist
 
01:50:54.189 --> 01:50:54.199 align:start position:0%
us with the implementation of this
 
01:50:58.270 --> 01:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
program um and again the requirement of
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
we um I go back to the um the
 
01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
requirement to have a depository it
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
appears we will have to have this
 
01:51:08.109 --> 01:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
facility in order to really uh be able
 
01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
to implement um the electronic currency
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
backed by gold and silver or another
 
01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
speci um uh to be able to again
 
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
Implement uh the electronic currency so
 
01:51:21.149 --> 01:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
so based on our understanding of of this
 
01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
bill um it does provide the ability to
 
01:51:27.149 --> 01:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
charge fees there are a couple of
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
Provisions that mentioned that so it
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
sounds like a program like this one uh
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
in order to run the operation uh or this
 
01:51:36.189 --> 01:51:36.199 align:start position:0%
operation it will will have the ability
 
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
to charge fees and is clear is very
 
01:51:40.750 --> 01:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
unknown um what those fields will look
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
like but again it really does appear to
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
require significant resources in order
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
to launch this um in in the funding is
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
not apparent uh from a review of this
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
bill um so that's what I would like to
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
share and and i' be happy to answer any
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
questions you may have so I stay away
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
from um you know the exchange rate all
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
of those questions are
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
just there we can go more in depth into
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
the conversation but at a higher level
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
those will be our initial uh concerns in
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
order to to operate a program like this
 
01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:20.709 align:start position:0%
order to to operate a program like this
one

01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you I do see the fiscal
 
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
note the million million plus was that
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
your number or or I don't know what and
 
01:52:31.390 --> 01:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
that's just a number to to to cons if if
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
the state were to build a facility you
 
01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
would require millions in order to do
 
01:52:38.910 --> 01:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
that right and then uh just out of humor
 
01:52:40.589 --> 01:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
because we we're tearing down a bank
 
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
that probably had a vault in
 
01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
it but uh but did would at some point in
 
01:52:46.990 --> 01:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
time I don't know if you know our
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
history but did we ever ever store gold
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
in our in the in the State House there
 
01:52:53.310 --> 01:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
in in that Vault that we ever had going
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
I guess yes I mean we have a vault as
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
our vault is very old uh is is it does
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
not have the um it's not a modern vault
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned the Department of
 
01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
Justice probably has a better Vault than
 
01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
we do um certainly um I think yes likely
 
01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
we had gold at some point there we go
 
01:53:13.629 --> 01:53:13.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate you
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank Mr chairman thank you very much
 
01:53:18.589 --> 01:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
and then again I'm I'm apologize again
 
01:53:21.790 --> 01:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
Yuri I I did not see your card some got
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
it mixed in with the uh with all the
 
01:53:24.239 --> 01:53:42.750 align:start position:0%
it mixed in with the uh with all the
pros

01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:47.229 --> 01:53:47.239 align:start position:0%
so uh Mr chair dear committee members uh
 
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
for the record representative Yuri of
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
representing Mar Mark 10 hookit and Dan
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
Barton uh uh I'm speaking in support of
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
this legislation I'm very thankful for
 
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
your time considering this bill and let
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
me concentrate on experience of my
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
constituents uh hookit residents are
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
receiving significantly increased tax
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
bills this month mine being an average
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
increased over
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
$1,400 uh for many constituents on fixed
 
01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:20.550 align:start position:0%
$1,400 uh for many constituents on fixed
income

01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh it is not sustainable some have no
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
choice but to be priced out of their own
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
homes and leave hooks it forever uh and
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
inflation is the largest contributing
 
01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:35.719 align:start position:0%
factor giving our mirima County a little
 
01:54:39.229 --> 01:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
choice but to follow the wage increases
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
and hookit had to pay more to school
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
teachers so this legislation will give
 
01:54:48.790 --> 01:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
my constituents real protection against
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
inflation especially for those on fixed
 
01:54:55.229 --> 01:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
income uh I received testimonies from my
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
constituents both Y and old supporting
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
this bill and I will not uh read those
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
here in full but to give you an idea uh
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
I had a family of retirees crashed by
 
01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
said price and tax increases uh and
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
asking for this bill to pass to give and
 
01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
I quote individuals a way to access
 
01:55:20.830 --> 01:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
stability and security during this
 
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
uncertain times uh I also had a young
 
01:55:27.629 --> 01:55:27.639 align:start position:0%
family uh ready to start investing and
 
01:55:30.750 --> 01:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
valuing precious metals and exciting
 
01:55:33.069 --> 01:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
that actually a growing number of
 
01:55:35.310 --> 01:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
establishments are accepting gold and
 
01:55:37.950 --> 01:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
silver as payment one
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
problem uh and a brief quote from my
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
constituent here but we do need to pay
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
taxes to State and local governments
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
currently the government only accept
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
dollars if if we could pay our taxes
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
with real money gold and silver it would
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
make our lives easier and better it
 
01:55:58.629 --> 01:55:58.639 align:start position:0%
would also improve New Hampshire's
 
01:56:00.910 --> 01:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
Financial Health

protect Granite stators from the
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
devastating effects of
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
inflation um if you turn to the first
 
01:58:14.830 --> 01:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
page I I I asked the question what is
 
01:58:16.750 --> 01:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
inflation the simplest definition of
 
01:58:18.910 --> 01:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
inflation is the expansion of the
 
01:58:21.950 --> 01:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
currency Supply so if you look on the
 
01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
chart look down to uh January of roughly
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
of 2020 through November of 2023 our
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
national debt increase by 10 trilli
 
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
777 billion from January 20 the total
 
01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
debt was 23 Bill uh trillion dollar and
 
01:58:42.669 --> 01:58:42.679 align:start position:0%
by November of last year it was 34
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
trillion that is an increase of the
 
01:58:47.310 --> 01:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
monetary Supply by
 
01:58:50.069 --> 01:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
46.4% as new currency is purchase that
 
01:58:51.870 --> 01:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
dilutes the current purchasing power of
 
01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
all currency in circulation so we've
 
01:58:57.790 --> 01:58:57.800 align:start position:0%
lost around 4 almost 50% of our
 
01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
years on page number
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
two um and you'll see in the chart that
 
01:59:11.069 --> 01:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
in 1971 Nixon took us off the gold
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
standard effectively making the dollar a
 
01:59:16.189 --> 01:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
fiat currency just it's unbacked just by
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
the full faith and credit of the United
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
States throughout all of recorded human
 
01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
history there's never been a single and
 
01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
there's over 6,000 recorded references
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
to Fiat currencies unbacked by any type
 
01:59:31.470 --> 01:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
of precious metal or or base metal not
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
one single fiat currency has survived in
 
01:59:37.589 --> 01:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
all human uh human history if you look
 
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
at the chart you'll see that most
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
current currencies were flat because
 
01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
they were pegged to the dollar the
 
01:59:45.390 --> 01:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
moment that the currencies were unpegged
 
01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:46.550 align:start position:0%
moment that the currencies were unpegged
in

01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:59:49.229 --> 01:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
1971 most currencies dropped in Val
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
value by 90% or more if you go to page
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
three the next uh two charts is it two
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
three charts next three charts will show
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
um the difference between assets um
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
compared to the dollar versus gold in
 
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
this first chart we'll see the uh that
 
02:00:12.030 --> 02:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
the C gold has protected um against
 
02:00:14.069 --> 02:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
inflation you'll see at the beginning of
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
the chart it's 1971 where gold and the
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
dollar were combined and then from 1971
 
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
to today we have a
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
667 per inflation rate in the dollar
 
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's a loss of purchasing power uh if
 
02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
you look at gold gold is actually
 
02:00:31.149 --> 02:00:31.159 align:start position:0%
increased in value compared to the
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
dollar by 84 almost
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
85% gold has protected purchasing power
 
02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:39.270 align:start position:0%
85% gold has protected purchasing power
for

02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
Millennia the next chart on page number
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
four we're comparing gold um to oil uh
 
02:00:48.189 --> 02:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
you'll see at the beginning in 1971 when
 
02:00:51.709 --> 02:00:51.719 align:start position:0%
we were pegged to the to Gold oil was in
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
in the dollar was pretty much the same
 
02:00:58.510 --> 02:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
price but as we deeg you'll see that you
 
02:01:02.069 --> 02:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
can buy more oil with uh with gold
 
02:01:04.669 --> 02:01:04.679 align:start position:0%
throughout the last 53 years versus the
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
dollar oil has gone up 600% just like
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
the inflation of the dollar while gold
 
02:01:12.629 --> 02:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
has actually increased in in value by
 
02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
50% and finally the last chart um real
 
02:01:20.109 --> 02:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
estate so we go back to 19 1 where the
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
dollar was pegged and when it was uh dep
 
02:01:24.589 --> 02:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
pegged you'll see that the value of
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
homes have gone up 9
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
65% uh compared to the dollar while it
 
02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
this gold has maintained its value in
 
02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
fact in 1979 you the average price of a
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
house was
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
$73,000 which was 268 ounces of gold
 
02:01:43.510 --> 02:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
today the average price of a house is
 
02:01:47.229 --> 02:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
513,000 Guess How many ounces of gold
 
02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
268 cuz gold maintain is purchasing
 
02:01:51.790 --> 02:01:51.800 align:start position:0%
power so I share all this information to
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
you to explain the value of having a
 
02:01:57.629 --> 02:01:57.639 align:start position:0%
gold back currency and uh citizens for
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
sound money my organization along with
 
02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
representative a are the ones to help uh
 
02:02:05.229 --> 02:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
write this piece of legislation and um I
 
02:02:07.149 --> 02:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
know some of you have some detailed
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any questions I'm
 
02:02:11.310 --> 02:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
more than happy to answer them since we
 
02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
were the ones our legislative committee
 
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
wrote this bill and it's currently in 20
 
02:02:17.109 --> 02:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
different states in different
 
02:02:20.990 --> 02:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:23.069 --> 02:02:23.079 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
02:02:27.030 --> 02:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chairman um I'm sorry
 
02:02:29.310 --> 02:02:29.320 align:start position:0%
I uh had to step out to the restroom so
 
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear all of your testimony um
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
but um my question is uh doesn't the
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um have enough
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
work to do without uh setting up a
 
02:02:45.069 --> 02:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
depository for gold and silver thank you
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
for that question representative Gibbs I
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
think that's the great question and we
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
have some experts behind me and also I
 
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
have a written testimony by one of the
 
02:02:54.189 --> 02:02:54.199 align:start position:0%
companies that would be actually bidding
 
02:02:56.910 --> 02:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
for to run the depository and create the
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
electronic currency uh load Labs is uh
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
it can't be here today but we have
 
02:03:04.589 --> 02:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
another company the president of Kinesis
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
which is another gold and uh uh company
 
02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
that will also manage the depository
 
02:03:12.750 --> 02:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
there won't be any additional work added
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
um the significant work added to the
 
02:03:16.109 --> 02:03:16.119 align:start position:0%
state because these private companies
 
02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:17.800 align:start position:0%
will manage with their contracts with
 
02:03:20.350 --> 02:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
Brinks or other private vating companies
 
02:03:22.109 --> 02:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
and also they've already created and
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
they're already working um across the
 
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
world uh using cryptocurrency in fact I
 
02:03:28.589 --> 02:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
have a debit card in my pocket I could
 
02:03:31.390 --> 02:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
show you that's backed by gold and I can
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
spend it anywhere right now buy you a
 
02:03:35.950 --> 02:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
cup of coffee buy uh dinner with gold
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
and the merchant won't even know because
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
at the moment of swiping that card the
 
02:03:42.510 --> 02:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
gold is sold at market prices which I
 
02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
think answers a few of your concerns and
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
the merchant will even know I pay with
 
02:03:49.629 --> 02:03:49.639 align:start position:0%
gold because they'll receive dollars
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
followup question well I was that you
 
02:03:54.549 --> 02:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
you hit it right on the nail what's in
 
02:03:55.870 --> 02:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
this for the State of New Hampshire to
 
02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
spend millions of dollars to do
 
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
something that Private Industry can do
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
is already doing why why do we want to
 
02:04:04.750 --> 02:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
muck around compete with you that's a
 
02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
beautiful question representative hunt
 
02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
because Article 1 Section 10 Clause one
 
02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:10.719 align:start position:0%
of the US Constitution gives the states
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
the authority to cre uh to make gold and
 
02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
silver legal tender in the state right
 
02:04:16.109 --> 02:04:16.119 align:start position:0%
now there's only four states in the
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
Union what but why would we want to do
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
that if it's
 
02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
if it's going to cost us thousands and
 
02:04:23.149 --> 02:04:23.159 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of dollars to have
 
02:04:25.470 --> 02:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
an infrastructure for it what's in it
 
02:04:27.870 --> 02:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire load and uh that's
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
great question uh load and Kinesis will
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
actually uh provide the technology and
 
02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure for free and uh and
 
02:04:39.669 --> 02:04:39.679 align:start position:0%
I'll let the president of Kinesis in
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
this statement right here explains it
 
02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
the only thing they request um since
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
they'll be putting up the money for the
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is potentially donating
 
02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
20 load is asking for $250,000 in gold
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
and silver to Kickstart the depository
 
02:04:54.750 --> 02:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
amounts of gold and silver but all the
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
technology will be provided and the way
 
02:05:00.030 --> 02:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
and and after the companies recuperate
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
their uh fees for creating the
 
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure then there's a split
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue model where the state will
 
02:05:07.870 --> 02:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
receive revenue from every transaction
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
using the the digital
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
currency uh okay represent gives you may
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
have your question uh thank you uh uh
 
02:05:19.030 --> 02:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up question uh you mentioned a
 
02:05:22.549 --> 02:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
debit card based on on gold um who
 
02:05:25.390 --> 02:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
administers that de debit card system
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
and why do you trust them well right now
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
the debit card I have is is partnered
 
02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
with a bank in the United States that's
 
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
FDIC insured um and I know Kinesis and
 
02:05:36.669 --> 02:05:36.679 align:start position:0%
lo have debit cards in other countries
 
02:05:38.350 --> 02:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
and they will be coming uh debit card
 
02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
will be coming to this country soon I'm
 
02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
sure uh Eric main who's the president of
 
02:05:45.229 --> 02:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
Kinesis can give you a little bit more
 
02:05:47.470 --> 02:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
information about that but it it's
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
partnered with the banks and the Master
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
Card I think is a card I have in my
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
pocket I think Visa is uh also an option
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
but they have fees yes any any it's
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
about uh 22 to 45 basis points for using
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
the system um and for instance I I don't
 
02:06:09.390 --> 02:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
want to take too much time repres uh the
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
president Eric will be able to discuss
 
02:06:13.149 --> 02:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
how their fee system for merchant work
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
but by having the merchant system
 
02:06:17.950 --> 02:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
Merchants will save between 200 and 400%
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
on credit cards charges if they accept
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
the digital currency because it's only
 
02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
22 to 45 basis points versus 2 to four%
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
which is 2 400% uh 400 basis points so
 
02:06:32.430 --> 02:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
there's a savings to Merchants if they
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
decid to accept gold and silver
 
02:06:39.149 --> 02:06:39.159 align:start position:0%
currency okay I'm missing something here
 
02:06:41.390 --> 02:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
but that's all right all right any other
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
questions see thank you very much thank
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%

02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
gold Refinery we uh have built and and
 
02:07:47.549 --> 02:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
operate depositories around the world um
 
02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
we have vaulting
 
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
um accounts um with the major thirdparty
 
02:07:58.430 --> 02:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh vaulting providers in 13 different
 
02:07:58.440 --> 02:08:00.270 align:start position:0%
uh vaulting providers in 13 different
countries

02:08:00.270 --> 02:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
countries
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
um and so you know I'm here to answer
 
02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
questions what what we've done
 
02:08:10.510 --> 02:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the things you know we've done
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
our own organically of grown um our own
 
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
custom race Etc but maybe more relevant
 
02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
here is we we've done public private
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
Partnerships um with national
 
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
governments um to implement you know the
 
02:08:26.549 --> 02:08:26.559 align:start position:0%
kind of thing you're looking to do here
 
02:08:28.750 --> 02:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
so the most advanced one that is
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
operational is with the um the
 
02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
government of
 
02:08:36.990 --> 02:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
Indonesia where we have um integrated
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
with um the local banks there um the
 
02:08:43.629 --> 02:08:43.639 align:start position:0%
payment systems Etc so it's it's our
 
02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
digital gold and silver currencies sit
 
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
side by side um the Indonesian rupia uh
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
through debit cards as uh Daniel was
 
02:08:55.069 --> 02:08:55.079 align:start position:0%
explaining there's an option Within
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
These debit cards where the people can
 
02:09:00.189 --> 02:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
use the existing Fiat or the digital
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
gold and silver um what we do is uh fee
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
based um and what we do with our
 
02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
government Partners uh it is a fee
 
02:09:14.430 --> 02:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
sharing model we're happy to take on the
 
02:09:17.910 --> 02:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
um the infrastructure cost of creating a
 
02:09:20.430 --> 02:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
a a platform for the government that's
 
02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
basically a white label of our existing
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
platform uh together with um the
 
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
vaulting and depository infrastructure
 
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
and what we ask for in return is a
 
02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
certain uh a certain amount of the of
 
02:09:37.229 --> 02:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
the funds that get transacted through
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
the system come to us first and then uh
 
02:09:42.189 --> 02:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
after we recoup our cost for doing it
 
02:09:44.350 --> 02:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
then we share with with um with the
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
state um it's a model that is um very
 
02:09:50.350 --> 02:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
welcomed in in these countries that
 
02:09:54.069 --> 02:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
we're doing with um and it's actually
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%
has the potential to be quite a robust
 
02:09:59.669 --> 02:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream for uh for the
 
02:10:04.109 --> 02:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
states I'm happy to answer any
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
questions okay we do have several
 
02:10:09.310 --> 02:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
spe you downloaded your
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
book okay I haven't seen that one but
 
02:10:18.750 --> 02:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
okay yes that's that's say kesis and
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
Isis monetary system yes yes ma'am one
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
of the things it it points out in here
 
02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
is that the model that you the model
 
02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
that you have works well in countries
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
where banks are not that prevalent and
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
people can't get to banks that easily
 
02:10:36.910 --> 02:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
and so it's an alternative way of
 
02:10:40.709 --> 02:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
Distributing I guess funding without uh
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure that we have in the
 
02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
United States where we have two banks on
 
02:10:48.069 --> 02:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
every corner so that part of it is we
 
02:10:48.079 --> 02:10:50.390 align:start position:0%
every corner so that part of it is we
can't

02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:52.510 --> 02:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
what's your question I guess the
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
question is in this model you talk about
 
02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
making money it's not easy to describe
 
02:10:59.870 --> 02:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
if you have not read
 
02:11:02.189 --> 02:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
this if you
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
have the way you make the way it talks
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
about this if you don't have a lot of
 
02:11:09.069 --> 02:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
money to put into it which a lot of
 
02:11:12.229 --> 02:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
people don't then the way you uh recoup
 
02:11:15.790 --> 02:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
money on it is by referring other people
 
02:11:16.990 --> 02:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:11:20.990 --> 02:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
like uh yeah kind a little bit like that
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying and what do
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
you get out of this what does the state
 
02:11:29.189 --> 02:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
get out of us being a front for this
 
02:11:30.910 --> 02:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
kind of an operation why do you even
 
02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:32.549 align:start position:0%
kind of an operation why do you even
need

02:11:32.549 --> 02:11:32.559 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
us well because of the trust of the
 
02:11:38.270 --> 02:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
state so you have you have citizens that
 
02:11:40.549 --> 02:11:40.559 align:start position:0%
trust the state and and when you do a
 
02:11:43.350 --> 02:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
public private partnership it means just
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
that you are publicly facing with a with
 
02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
a private company that has the
 
02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
experience and the ability to do what
 
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
you're looking for but at the end of the
 
02:11:54.990 --> 02:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
day the state is the state and people
 
02:11:57.910 --> 02:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
people trust your state um and that's
 
02:11:59.310 --> 02:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
that's true in in these countries
 
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
they're doing it I would say on the fees
 
02:12:03.310 --> 02:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
look it's a very small amount of fee
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
that happens every time uh somebody
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
sends or spends on this on the debit
 
02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
card or buys at a merchant it's 0.22%
 
02:12:16.990 --> 02:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
that's 22 basis points um and you know
 
02:12:18.990 --> 02:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
the for us it's the amount of adoption
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
so you have you have adoption um by a
 
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
large amount of the citizens doing it it
 
02:12:26.310 --> 02:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of money there's a lot of
 
02:12:28.069 --> 02:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
money that flows through I don't what's
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
the GDP of ofhs your 90 billion Etc
 
02:12:34.109 --> 02:12:34.119 align:start position:0%
whatever U but if you take a small
 
02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
percentage of that using this system um
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
you can generate a lot of Revenue and
 
02:12:41.310 --> 02:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
it's ongoing and what is it for the for
 
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
the individuals well the model that we
 
02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
set out is a fee sharing model so it's
 
02:12:48.109 --> 02:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
not only the state that participates
 
02:12:51.310 --> 02:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
Ates in that Revenue share um it is the
 
02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
citizens themselves so what we do is all
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
those transactions that happen um uh
 
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
within that ecosystem is collected into
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
a Master Fee pool and every month we
 
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
give back depending on how you utilize
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
that um to various people within that
 
02:13:13.470 --> 02:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
within the ecosystem so some are for
 
02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
people that have just spent it of course
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
off the top line is the the the um the
 
02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
split with the state so they get their
 
02:13:22.990 --> 02:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
the state gets their piece let's say
 
02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:23.790 align:start position:0%
the state gets their piece let's say
it's

02:13:23.790 --> 02:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
5050 uh then out of the other
 
02:13:30.549 --> 02:13:30.559 align:start position:0%
50% um there would be um a certain
 
02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
percentage that goes to people that just
 
02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
are holding the holding the token as a
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
savings and then there's a different
 
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
percentage that goes to to those that
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
are actively spending it it's what we
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
call velocity we're trying to create
 
02:13:43.629 --> 02:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
velocity and moving money just like you
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
question in this in the um pamphlet it
 
02:13:54.669 --> 02:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
talks about that the money that's made
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
is a um in fees goes to the Cayman
 
02:14:00.430 --> 02:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
Islands and the books are kept by you in
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
the Cayman Islands and we get whatever
 
02:14:05.549 --> 02:14:05.559 align:start position:0%
you guys tell us we're supposed to get
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh is that how you see this working here
 
02:14:10.270 --> 02:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
no no no that's not how it works ma'am
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
so Kinesis we have 27 different entities
 
02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh around the world and because we're
 
02:14:18.589 --> 02:14:18.599 align:start position:0%
facing different regulatory regimes
 
02:14:21.549 --> 02:14:21.559 align:start position:0%
um what uh the holding company is a is a
 
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
Cayman Islands company but what we would
 
02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
look to do here as we have done
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
elsewhere we have a local entity that's
 
02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:30.470 align:start position:0%
elsewhere we have a local entity that's
locally

02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
locally
 
02:14:32.709 --> 02:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
regulated um and so it wouldn't be
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the Cayman Islands
 
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
for example so in Indonesia or in Panama
 
02:14:39.950 --> 02:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
where we're doing it we have a local
 
02:14:43.390 --> 02:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
Kinesis entity that is and and have to
 
02:14:45.549 --> 02:14:45.559 align:start position:0%
say on the regulatory front because
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's has been a piece that's that's
 
02:14:48.549 --> 02:14:48.559 align:start position:0%
been brought up
 
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
um by multiple multiple people so we
 
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
welcome um being part whatever the
 
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory infrastructure that makes
 
02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
sense so uh in Indonesia it's with the
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
um the commodity regulator and the
 
02:15:06.790 --> 02:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
banking uh regulator in Panama it's it's
 
02:15:08.629 --> 02:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
the central bank and and the bank
 
02:15:11.629 --> 02:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
supervisory regulator so all those
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
components um are are put together um
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
and we're just providing the
 
02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it's up to the state to
 
02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
run it we we can you know support it um
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
and provide the the uh the people Etc
 
02:15:30.270 --> 02:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
but on the depository piece um what
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
we've done with other partners is you
 
02:15:35.229 --> 02:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
know no gold can come in no gold can
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
come out nothing can happen without a
 
02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
multi signature that would mean a
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative of the state and the
 
02:15:44.189 --> 02:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
depository operations sign off on it
 
02:15:46.109 --> 02:15:46.119 align:start position:0%
electronically before anything happens
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
so the the state has as as with our
 
02:15:51.069 --> 02:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
other partners um a lot of oversight
 
02:15:52.149 --> 02:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
have a real
 
02:15:55.750 --> 02:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
question representative two seconds next
 
02:15:58.430 --> 02:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
testifying Mr main my question what is
 
02:16:04.709 --> 02:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
the value of storing money in gold or
 
02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
silver bullion before spending it as a
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
debit card yeah so this is this is a
 
02:16:14.350 --> 02:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
classic thing called gresham's law that
 
02:16:17.350 --> 02:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
that uh bad money drives out good so if
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
you think of it of having a piece of
 
02:16:22.350 --> 02:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
your silver coin in your hand versus a
 
02:16:24.270 --> 02:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
paper dollar which one you going to buy
 
02:16:26.069 --> 02:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
coffee with I'm going to use the paper
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
dollar right I'm going to keep the
 
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
silver I'm going to keep the gold and
 
02:16:31.629 --> 02:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
this means bad money drives out good
 
02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
that's gum law the way you defeat that
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
in our model is through this fee sharing
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh system where people are getting a
 
02:16:41.150 --> 02:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
yield on just holding the gold they're
 
02:16:43.790 --> 02:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
getting a yield on getting cash back by
 
02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
spending it uh and we share these these
 
02:16:49.629 --> 02:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
fees um with them and so it becomes an
 
02:16:52.150 --> 02:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
income generating uh and there and
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's income to be generated at every
 
02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
level the merchant level the individual
 
02:16:59.910 --> 02:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
level the corporate level um and of
 
02:17:03.469 --> 02:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
course the state and you know our level
 
02:17:05.070 --> 02:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
but that's as long as gold keeps going
 
02:17:06.030 --> 02:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
up in
 
02:17:09.870 --> 02:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
value not I mean theoretically the rule
 
02:17:12.750 --> 02:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
of Economics is that that the reason why
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
gold keeps going up value because it's a
 
02:17:17.230 --> 02:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
limited resource there's only so much
 
02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
gold out there so therefore you're bu
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
betting on the fact that there's only
 
02:17:24.389 --> 02:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
going to be a handful of gold out there
 
02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
there's no no no you know like someone
 
02:17:29.070 --> 02:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
was talking about new alchemies you
 
02:17:30.589 --> 02:17:30.599 align:start position:0%
we're we're not g to have somebody can
 
02:17:32.349 --> 02:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
turn lead into gold and suddenly change
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
everything but you're the whole thing
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
you're betting on is the fact that gold
 
02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
will continue to go up because it's a
 
02:17:38.399 --> 02:17:39.870 align:start position:0%
will continue to go up because it's a
limited

02:17:39.870 --> 02:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
limited
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
resource well Mr chairman I would say
 
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that it continually go
 
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
up but that over time it is a
 
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
stabilizing Factor
 
02:17:50.429 --> 02:17:50.439 align:start position:0%
basis against the US
 
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
dollar well I don't know if it's
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
stabilizing because it keeps going up in
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
value keep keep taking more dollars so
 
02:17:59.230 --> 02:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
so that that's you know look it's a it's
 
02:18:01.309 --> 02:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
a perk that it goes up but it doesn't
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
have to go up for this model to work it
 
02:18:06.349 --> 02:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
will work over the long term if gold is
 
02:18:07.950 --> 02:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
stable compared to the value of the
 
02:18:09.790 --> 02:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
dollar you certainly don't want it to go
 
02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
down don't want to go down all these
 
02:18:13.629 --> 02:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
people who are all depending upon that
 
02:18:16.709 --> 02:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
revenue of of that that growth yes but
 
02:18:18.509 --> 02:18:18.519 align:start position:0%
as you just pointed out it is a limited
 
02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
resource and so the inclination it can
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
well stable or go up for a long all
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
right Senator Herbert my question is
 
02:18:30.190 --> 02:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
sort of related to to the
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
Chairman's from your perspective what
 
02:18:37.950 --> 02:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
happens based on fluctuations in mining
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
in other words is the gold production
 
02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
pretty steady over time but I know in
 
02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
the in like in the 1890s there was a
 
02:18:50.669 --> 02:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
huge huge fight uh because in
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
agriculture you borrow and then you pay
 
02:18:55.790 --> 02:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
back and if the and if the gold for
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
whatever reason comes out you know goes
 
02:19:02.709 --> 02:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
up much higher it causes severe problems
 
02:19:05.549 --> 02:19:05.559 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm just wondering how do you how
 
02:19:08.910 --> 02:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
do you how do you well how do you manage
 
02:19:11.589 --> 02:19:11.599 align:start position:0%
this this because gold is going to be
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
high and low it's going to be higher and
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
low but it it it is relatively stable
 
02:19:21.150 --> 02:19:21.160 align:start position:0%
over long periods of time so mine
 
02:19:23.070 --> 02:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
production is a thing that is you know
 
02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
yes there is new mine production comes
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
on board all the time and you have some
 
02:19:30.190 --> 02:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
big blips where somebody um you know has
 
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
something that's a big resource but it
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
costs a lot of money to bring gold out
 
02:19:38.950 --> 02:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
of the ground um as you deplete those
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
that are closer to the surface you have
 
02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
to Dig Down Deeper and it's harder to
 
02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
get and it's more expensive so there's a
 
02:19:47.070 --> 02:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
point where mining new gold is not even
 
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
worth it now it's worth it where it is
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
now U but you get down to $800 an ounce
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
or something like that it's not worth to
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
to mine anything anymore um
 
02:19:59.830 --> 02:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
so there's not going to be a whole lot
 
02:20:03.389 --> 02:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
more gold out out of the ground um it's
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a deep leading resource over
 
02:20:07.590 --> 02:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
time there will be some you know some
 
02:20:09.550 --> 02:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
upticks and some production but over a
 
02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
long period um gold production will go
 
02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
down which means one other question it's
 
02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
related do we're getting H my question
 
02:20:23.389 --> 02:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
to you is um where is the uh where does
 
02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
the rubber meet the road in your
 
02:20:27.630 --> 02:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
business I know I understand I think how
 
02:20:31.550 --> 02:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
you make money but where is the uh the
 
02:20:33.670 --> 02:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh fluctuations in the currencies you
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
have to deal with I mean how is that uh
 
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
moderated how do you how do you keep up
 
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
with currency fluctuations is it
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
something you have to like you know pay
 
02:20:47.950 --> 02:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of attention to or
 
02:20:50.830 --> 02:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
okay this I think that's it's a Forex
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
you know I don't how is how is how is
 
02:20:56.429 --> 02:20:56.439 align:start position:0%
how has this all worked out is this all
 
02:20:59.670 --> 02:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
Forex well yes so normal way that any
 
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
company would would manage their
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
business if they're doing business in
 
02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:04.469 align:start position:0%
business if they're doing business in
multic

02:21:04.469 --> 02:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
multic
 
02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
currencies great thank you oh no the
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
currency makes the exchange all right
 
02:21:10.990 --> 02:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
all right I got three cards here but I
 
02:21:15.070 --> 02:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
hope we can go quicker here all right
 
02:21:22.429 --> 02:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.910 --> 02:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
Exchange thank you you going to make
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%

02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
repository for gold and
 
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
silver we are already here we have a a
 
02:22:19.469 --> 02:22:19.479 align:start position:0%
management office in Manchester New
 
02:22:25.309 --> 02:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and we are
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
currently um already transacting in gold
 
02:22:30.590 --> 02:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
and silver with member-to-member
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
transfers and other members come to us
 
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
buying and depositing gold and things
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
like that and the Commerce is already
 
02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
there The Exchange and the market is
 
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
already there and we have 100 businesses
 
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
that are openly accepting gold and
 
02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
silver as payment we have thousands of
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
people that are transacting amongst
 
02:22:50.190 --> 02:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
themselves in gold and silver and the
 
02:22:52.469 --> 02:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
question that we get frequently is what
 
02:22:54.309 --> 02:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
are they supposed to do with their taxes
 
02:22:55.389 --> 02:22:55.399 align:start position:0%
what are they supposed to do with their
 
02:22:58.309 --> 02:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
fees and how do they manage that so what
 
02:23:00.349 --> 02:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
we're asking for from this bill and I'm
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill but um what we're
 
02:23:05.429 --> 02:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
asking for is Clarity uh out of this
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
bill and and what to do with these
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
transactions that are already happening
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's already things being purchased
 
02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
um and there's
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
also thousands of granite Staters that
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
are sitting on holds of gold and silver
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
and they have no idea what to do with
 
02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
them so one of the things that we've
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
discovered since uh coming here and
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
working with the local Granite Staters
 
02:23:29.070 --> 02:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
and I am a granite Stater um is that
 
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
these folks when we do contact them
 
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
they're relieved that they have some
 
02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
sort of a service that can take this
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
gold and silver that they've been
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
sitting on for years and years so there
 
02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
are Untold millions of dollars worth of
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
value that are already inside the
 
02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
granite state that are not being used uh
 
02:23:49.309 --> 02:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
as as um as funds and not being used in
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
the marketplace because they're just
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
sitting inside family Collections and so
 
02:23:56.590 --> 02:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
forth and so if we can provide them with
 
02:23:58.750 --> 02:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
practical applications and practical
 
02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
services for being able to manage those
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
gold and silver uh then they're able to
 
02:24:07.110 --> 02:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
put that into the marketplace as um a a
 
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
um oh I'm getting lost in words here I'm
 
02:24:13.830 --> 02:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
getting hungry as well so but uh but if
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
we can get that into the marketplace for
 
02:24:17.469 --> 02:24:17.479 align:start position:0%
trade then there's going to be uh a lot
 
02:24:20.110 --> 02:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
of benefit for the State of New
 
02:24:21.870 --> 02:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and for granite Staters to be
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
able to uh put more value into the
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
marketplace for trade and that equals
 
02:24:30.670 --> 02:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
High you know more Revenue through taxes
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
and fees and so forth and we are also
 
02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
the um representation of how this can
 
02:24:39.309 --> 02:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
work at scale we do have 53,000 members
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh we do um have these transactions we
 
02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
do operate a vault uh these are are
 
02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
we're already here we're already doing
 
02:24:49.710 --> 02:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
it and we can
 
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
um we can just show that it works and
 
02:24:54.670 --> 02:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
that you can transact in gold and silver
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
and it's already happening great thank
 
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you uh Jason uh
 
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
D Zer
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
Zer hi there thank you my name is Jason
 
02:25:10.950 --> 02:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
dner I'm a software engineer in
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and I've been working in the
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
digital currency space since
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
2013 I led the design of the world
 
02:25:19.950 --> 02:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
world's first Multi-Device Bitcoin
 
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
wallet and I invented a number of the
 
02:25:24.990 --> 02:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
technical upgrades uh to a to the smart
 
02:25:26.750 --> 02:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
Contracting system of one of the world's
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
largest cryptocurrency networks I'm
 
02:25:30.990 --> 02:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
deeply familiar with this space and with
 
02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
the technical and operational
 
02:25:34.469 --> 02:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
requirements of the sort of digital
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
currency proposed in this bill um I'm
 
02:25:39.150 --> 02:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
also here on a personal basis I don't
 
02:25:40.910 --> 02:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
represent any companies and I have no no
 
02:25:43.870 --> 02:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
products to sell um I am excited about
 
02:25:46.269 --> 02:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
this bill because uh I believe it would
 
02:25:47.550 --> 02:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
create an opport
 
02:25:49.150 --> 02:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities for companies to build
 
02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:51.319 align:start position:0%
digital project digital currency
 
02:25:54.510 --> 02:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
products uh with a with with a reliable
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
American asset um I think it could
 
02:25:59.110 --> 02:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
attract significant investment and
 
02:26:01.230 --> 02:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
create thousands of well-paying jobs in
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um here's why tokenized
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
real world assets like this uh matter
 
02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
tokens enable open payment networks with
 
02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
lower fees and faster settlement than
 
02:26:17.710 --> 02:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
proprietary closed Networks lending
 
02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
systems that don't suffer from the kind
 
02:26:21.910 --> 02:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
of cascading failures that we saw in the
 
02:26:23.469 --> 02:26:23.479 align:start position:0%
2008 financial
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
crisis free and open crowdfunding
 
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
systems that allow nonprofits to reduce
 
02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:29.990 align:start position:0%
systems that allow nonprofits to reduce
their

02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
overhead and give donors more visibility
 
02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
into the flow of
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
funds and ultr transparent asset
 
02:26:39.710 --> 02:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
exchanges where large investors don't
 
02:26:42.269 --> 02:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
get cost or timing advantages versus
 
02:26:42.279 --> 02:26:43.469 align:start position:0%
get cost or timing advantages versus
smaller

02:26:43.469 --> 02:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
02:26:46.630 --> 02:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
investors and more um American companies
 
02:26:48.750 --> 02:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
are are building the the plumbing the
 
02:26:51.269 --> 02:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
tools and services to make these
 
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
Innovations happen but here's the
 
02:26:56.150 --> 02:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
problem uh due to Federal regulatory
 
02:26:58.670 --> 02:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
uncertainty American assets are very
 
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
rarely flowing through those
 
02:27:03.269 --> 02:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
pipes this bill would solve that problem
 
02:27:05.630 --> 02:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
by giving us a trusted American asset to
 
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
power these applications with American
 
02:27:10.830 --> 02:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
companies um so with that in mind let's
 
02:27:12.870 --> 02:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
talk about how the depository is funded
 
02:27:14.830 --> 02:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh the token tokens Can automatically
 
02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
assess and ACW fees over time
 
02:27:19.950 --> 02:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh upon redemption or when transferred
 
02:27:22.190 --> 02:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
between networks it's possible for the
 
02:27:24.830 --> 02:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
depository to generate Revenue both from
 
02:27:27.990 --> 02:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
those direct fees and from activities
 
02:27:29.870 --> 02:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
like Market making and liquidity
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
provision and decentralized exchange
 
02:27:34.429 --> 02:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
protocols and and I'm happy to talk more
 
02:27:36.269 --> 02:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
about those technical details but for
 
02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
now I'll just note that smart contracts
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
the algorithms that run on these digital
 
02:27:43.150 --> 02:27:43.160 align:start position:0%
currency networks can really reduce the
 
02:27:45.309 --> 02:27:45.319 align:start position:0%
overhead of collecting that
 
02:27:48.190 --> 02:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue there are both us-based and
 
02:27:50.309 --> 02:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
offshore entities offering depository
 
02:27:52.510 --> 02:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
services like this that collect millions
 
02:27:55.150 --> 02:27:55.160 align:start position:0%
in Revenue annually and with the added
 
02:27:57.550 --> 02:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
stability and legal certainty of New
 
02:27:59.630 --> 02:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's seal we can expect that a
 
02:28:02.190 --> 02:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire issued token uh would
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
expand that market and generate
 
02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
significant revenue for the
 
02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
state to summarize this is a profitable
 
02:28:11.230 --> 02:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
business and I expect the depository to
 
02:28:15.550 --> 02:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
fully fund itself um and I also want to
 
02:28:18.190 --> 02:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
note that uh initial startup costs um
 
02:28:21.309 --> 02:28:21.319 align:start position:0%
could be supplemented or or funded by uh
 
02:28:23.550 --> 02:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
the state selling a note or possibly
 
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
crowdfunded uh the this is something
 
02:28:28.269 --> 02:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
that can maintain itself uh over the
 
02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
long term so it's the initial startup
 
02:28:33.150 --> 02:28:33.160 align:start position:0%
costs that are that are in question um
 
02:28:34.429 --> 02:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time and
 
02:28:38.110 --> 02:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
I'm open to answering any questions yes
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
I have a question about um Have you
 
02:28:42.750 --> 02:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
communicated with the New Hampshire uh
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
Treasurer and the uh doj no no I I just
 
02:28:47.910 --> 02:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that in this comment
 
02:28:51.070 --> 02:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
because we had spoken with it earlier uh
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
I I do believe I do believe that this is
 
02:28:54.750 --> 02:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
the the kind of operation that could be
 
02:28:57.150 --> 02:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
funded by selling a note uh to investors
 
02:28:59.469 --> 02:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
who would who would fully bear the risk
 
02:29:00.950 --> 02:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
of whether or not the operation
 
02:29:02.910 --> 02:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately was was
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
successful rather than it touching
 
02:29:07.389 --> 02:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds that that's why I wanted
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
to mention it in this Bond but they that
 
02:29:16.630 --> 02:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
uncollateralized um no no that loses
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
your whole benefit of the of the state
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
putting its name to it I I don't see how
 
02:29:23.469 --> 02:29:23.479 align:start position:0%
that would work I'm sorry uh I I wanted
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
to bring that into to the testimony but
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
um no it would it would be a New
 
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire run uh depository in digital
 
02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
currency um I'm I wanted to mention that
 
02:29:35.469 --> 02:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
I think that this can be a completely
 
02:29:37.230 --> 02:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
budget neutral project and and could
 
02:29:38.590 --> 02:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately be a significant source of
 
02:29:40.670 --> 02:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
revenue for the state from an industry
 
02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
perspective it is already a profitable
 
02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
profitable business the issue is that uh
 
02:29:48.349 --> 02:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
due to regulatory uncertainty and in in
 
02:29:50.590 --> 02:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
federal federal regulatory uncertainty
 
02:29:52.150 --> 02:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
American businesses are not able to
 
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
meaningfully compete in this area uh uh
 
02:29:57.309 --> 02:29:57.319 align:start position:0%
European and Asian businesses are doing
 
02:29:59.710 --> 02:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
significantly better they're able to to
 
02:30:01.269 --> 02:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
um to work within those regulatory
 
02:30:04.349 --> 02:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
Frameworks much more clearly uh to have
 
02:30:06.590 --> 02:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
European and Asian assets working in
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
these digital systems so we can have
 
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
these these uh these Innovations like
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
open payment networks with very low fees
 
02:30:16.030 --> 02:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
and exchanges where where larger
 
02:30:17.630 --> 02:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
investors don't get advantages over
 
02:30:19.870 --> 02:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
smaller investors but we're using them
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
with assets that are not American and it
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
would be uh I believe a a huge Boon to
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for New Hampshire assets
 
02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
to be used in that market I think it
 
02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
would bring thousands of well-paying
 
02:30:34.389 --> 02:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
jobs to the state and attract
 
02:30:37.150 --> 02:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
significant foreign and and domestic
 
02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
investment great thank
 
02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:41.840 align:start position:0%

once said that any Landing you can walk
 
02:31:15.469 --> 02:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
away from is a good one and I believe
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
the same thing can be said about the
 
02:31:18.910 --> 02:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
economic and monetary crisis that awaits
 
02:31:20.630 --> 02:31:20.640 align:start position:0%

retirement system um I now work in
 
02:32:22.429 --> 02:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
private Equity raising capital for King
 
02:32:24.550 --> 02:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
operating an oil and gas company
 
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
operator based out of Dallas Texas I'm
 
02:32:28.670 --> 02:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
also a major investor in a private
 
02:32:30.349 --> 02:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
company based in Orlando Florida that
 
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
focuses on first player entertainment
 
02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
specializing in Virtual theme parks and
 
02:32:37.389 --> 02:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
virtual entertainment um House Bill 1674
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
would go a long way towards building a
 
02:32:41.070 --> 02:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
trusted bridge between the digital and
 
02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
physical worlds in my opinion the idea
 
02:32:45.150 --> 02:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
of gold and silver circulating as real
 
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
money has been lost for many generations
 
02:32:48.910 --> 02:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
some of you may even remember getting
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
silver in your change however the
 
02:32:52.150 --> 02:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
recognition of gold and silver as
 
02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional money is making a
 
02:32:56.590 --> 02:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
remarkable comeback in recent years this
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee should proceed in passing the
 
02:32:59.790 --> 02:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
legal tender act the state should find a
 
02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
way to build a bullion depository in my
 
02:33:03.070 --> 02:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
opinion or partner up with private
 
02:33:04.349 --> 02:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
companies which we've already talked
 
02:33:05.830 --> 02:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
about here today with the know how to
 
02:33:08.030 --> 02:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
start an operative facility not passing
 
02:33:10.030 --> 02:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
the bill will hurt residents in the long
 
02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
run as the purchase power purchasing
 
02:33:13.950 --> 02:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
power of the US dollar continues its
 
02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
precipitous decline there are other
 
02:33:17.469 --> 02:33:17.479 align:start position:0%
States who are working on passing
 
02:33:19.269 --> 02:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
similar legislation and being an early
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
adopter would give New Hampshire
 
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
significant first mover advantages
 
02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
against other states who may choose
 
02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
Outsourcing to other states or private
 
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
companies or who will do nothing at all
 
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
although many bulling depository
 
02:33:31.950 --> 02:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
transactions would be physical deposits
 
02:33:33.630 --> 02:33:33.640 align:start position:0%
and or withdrawals they would not have
 
02:33:35.269 --> 02:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
to be settled physically billions of
 
02:33:36.990 --> 02:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
transactions are settled already on a
 
02:33:39.150 --> 02:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
daily basis across a broad spectrum of
 
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
payment options and Ledger systems the
 
02:33:43.750 --> 02:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
state should work with competent
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
partners with experience in establishing
 
02:33:47.309 --> 02:33:47.319 align:start position:0%
depositories and payment systems to
 
02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that New Hampshire is the gold
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
standard when it comes to establishing
 
02:33:53.150 --> 02:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
the functionality of precious metals and
 
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
payment systems pun intended to provide
 
02:33:57.630 --> 02:33:57.640 align:start position:0%
one such example to this committee the
 
02:33:59.429 --> 02:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
state of Texas retirement system helped
 
02:34:01.550 --> 02:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
their state establish the Texas bullion
 
02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
depository for the benefit of all Texas
 
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
pensioners and retirees after realizing
 
02:34:08.190 --> 02:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
they were spending many millions of
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
dollars per year in unnecessary fees to
 
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
faceless corporations like Black Rock
 
02:34:14.750 --> 02:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
and Vanguard those shares were
 
02:34:16.590 --> 02:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately redeemed for cash that cash
 
02:34:18.750 --> 02:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
was used by the Texas state treasurer to
 
02:34:20.710 --> 02:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
purchase physical gold and silver
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately for the Ben benefit of all
 
02:34:24.750 --> 02:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
pensioners any cost incurred by New
 
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the bulling program
 
02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
should also be compared against the
 
02:34:29.670 --> 02:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
annual cost of its Wall Street money
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
managers and how much of that savings
 
02:34:33.550 --> 02:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
would be repatriated by moving these
 
02:34:35.309 --> 02:34:35.319 align:start position:0%
proceeds directly to New Hampshire
 
02:34:37.790 --> 02:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
vaults in the form of gold and silver
 
02:34:39.230 --> 02:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
when it comes to New Hampshire citizens
 
02:34:41.389 --> 02:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
we prefer options and the free will to
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
choose what is the best um for our needs
 
02:34:46.870 --> 02:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
whenever possible House Bill 16 1974
 
02:34:48.830 --> 02:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
provides citizens with choice and would
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
not affect anyone who does not wish to
 
02:34:54.349 --> 02:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:59.790 --> 02:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:02.590 --> 02:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
spear the gold bullion deposit I spoke
 
02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
to someone at the Gold a representative
 
02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
at the bullion
 
02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
depository it cost them 2423 million to
 
02:35:12.429 --> 02:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
build it and the reason they buil it
 
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
built it was because they thought they
 
02:35:17.630 --> 02:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
had 86 million in gold from the
 
02:35:21.950 --> 02:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
University of Texas and the uh Texas A&amp;M
 
02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
in the middle of building it they sold
 
02:35:25.429 --> 02:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
off that gold because it wasn't liquid
 
02:35:26.990 --> 02:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
enough and the schools needed the money
 
02:35:29.830 --> 02:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
so they had nothing as of this summer
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
they had $140 million in assets that's
 
02:35:35.670 --> 02:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
all that's all they've got they never
 
02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
got what they said they were going is
 
02:35:38.309 --> 02:35:38.319 align:start position:0%
that great that they already did that so
 
02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
we can learn from that and that's why
 
02:35:41.630 --> 02:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
private companies are here today in my
 
02:35:44.349 --> 02:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
opinion um was it mishandled or handled
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
improperly or I I don't know I don't
 
02:35:47.469 --> 02:35:47.479 align:start position:0%
know the details of the Texas case
 
02:35:49.469 --> 02:35:49.479 align:start position:0%
specifically other than um that they
 
02:35:51.750 --> 02:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
started it um you know but I think
 
02:35:53.349 --> 02:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
there's probably a lot to learn from
 
02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
that um at the same time too I think uh
 
02:35:58.269 --> 02:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
establishing private Public Partnerships
 
02:35:59.469 --> 02:35:59.479 align:start position:0%
um if you go down the highway you can
 
02:36:00.990 --> 02:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
see Common Man chains you know there's
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
plenty of you know opportunities that
 
02:36:04.950 --> 02:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
private Public Partnerships have worked
 
02:36:06.630 --> 02:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
in the state um in the state
 
02:36:08.510 --> 02:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
particularly with the liquor stores um
 
02:36:10.349 --> 02:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
you know there's different models and
 
02:36:11.230 --> 02:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
you know the fact that we're all here
 
02:36:13.830 --> 02:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
today talking about it is a great
 
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
start we are uh debating right now for
 
02:36:19.790 --> 02:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
the marijuana is to a private public
 
02:36:21.790 --> 02:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
partnership and it's still having a lot
 
02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:23.510 align:start position:0%
partnership and it's still having a lot
of

02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
troubles okay thank you very
 
02:36:29.830 --> 02:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
much all right that closes the hearing
 
02:36:33.269 --> 02:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh I guess we get the a blue sheet the
 
02:36:37.750 --> 02:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
blue sheet okay uh 1674 the New
 
02:36:40.030 --> 02:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bankers Association are
 
02:36:42.190 --> 02:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
opposed and
 
02:36:46.670 --> 02:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative is for every uh m
 
02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
four Jonathan Leslie's four Daniel Diaz
 
02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
four Daniel tinman four Eric M four all
 
02:36:56.110 --> 02:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
these are people who spoke already and
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
and Katherine heck is
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
neutral the the Hampshire Bankers are
 
02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
opposed okay I am very apologetic about
 
02:37:09.990 --> 02:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
the delay here and having this final
 
02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:11.230 align:start position:0%
the delay here and having this final
bill

02:37:11.230 --> 02:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:37:16.990 --> 02:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
1444 um did did you put in a car I I
 
02:37:19.230 --> 02:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
I see Matt's got a card
 
02:37:22.030 --> 02:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
here no okay well why don't you come on
 
02:37:23.630 --> 02:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
up and testify and you can just do a
 
02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:33.150 --> 02:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
fine wrong way no C okay and this is the
 
02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:44.230 align:start position:0%
fine wrong way no C okay and this is the
blue

02:37:44.230 --> 02:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:46.750 --> 02:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
sheet sorry I need my
 
02:37:46.760 --> 02:38:10.590 align:start position:0%
sheet sorry I need my
glasses

02:38:10.590 --> 02:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:14.030 --> 02:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
right so thank you chair um my name is
 
02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Penza straford
 
02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
District 19 I was contacted uh this
 
02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
summer um to put in a bill concerning um
 
02:38:28.750 --> 02:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
actually the previous Bill and which my
 
02:38:30.750 --> 02:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
bill actually included some from the
 
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
previous as well as um this uh
 
02:38:38.269 --> 02:38:38.279 align:start position:0%
regulation of digital Mining
 
02:38:41.910 --> 02:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
and it was actually my bill was split
 
02:38:44.070 --> 02:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
and so this now is a
 
02:38:45.950 --> 02:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
standalone uh just because of me made
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
sense because there was another um with
 
02:38:50.990 --> 02:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
there was other legislation in there so
 
02:38:54.389 --> 02:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
I have to say I am no expert on this at
 
02:39:00.349 --> 02:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
all and um so I've you know I'm very um
 
02:39:02.230 --> 02:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
appreciative for the representative
 
02:39:04.389 --> 02:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
that's going to speak next to me because
 
02:39:08.990 --> 02:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
he is well-versed in this so in regards
 
02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
with like I had to understand what is
 
02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
digital asset mining I'm going to read
 
02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:16.309 align:start position:0%
digital asset mining I'm going to read
just

02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:39:18.990 --> 02:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
um just a couple things for you to
 
02:39:21.990 --> 02:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
explain what this is doing
 
02:39:25.070 --> 02:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
so um in a world right of
 
02:39:27.269 --> 02:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies you know you might have
 
02:39:29.469 --> 02:39:29.479 align:start position:0%
come across the term digital asset
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
mining perhaps you've you know heard of
 
02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
mining Bitcoin or ethereum maybe you've
 
02:39:37.389 --> 02:39:37.399 align:start position:0%
heard of you know if there's profits
 
02:39:39.870 --> 02:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
that that is made by you know generating
 
02:39:41.710 --> 02:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
such operations so I'm going to break
 
02:39:44.510 --> 02:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
down just a little bit about what it is
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
so digital assets set mining you know in
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
a sense provides rewards for work so you
 
02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
know whether it's like Bitcoin or
 
02:39:56.750 --> 02:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
ethereum Dogecoin render filecoin or any
 
02:39:59.230 --> 02:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
other cryptocurrency at its core digital
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
asset mining really is the act of being
 
02:40:05.309 --> 02:40:05.319 align:start position:0%
rewarded for expending computational
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
resources so these are you know in a
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
sense think of minable assets so those
 
02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
resources can come in pretty much any
 
02:40:16.870 --> 02:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
form of computational work we've seen
 
02:40:19.349 --> 02:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
uses from processing power and file
 
02:40:22.110 --> 02:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
storage to broadband Network provision
 
02:40:23.429 --> 02:40:23.439 align:start position:0%
um and then there's air quality
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
monitoring so to kind of understand some
 
02:40:29.469 --> 02:40:29.479 align:start position:0%
of these um I'm just going to go when I
 
02:40:31.630 --> 02:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
worked for a company where we had a
 
02:40:33.710 --> 02:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
server room so that server room had to
 
02:40:36.510 --> 02:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
be monitored uh with air
 
02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
quality um mostly for temperature and
 
02:40:41.309 --> 02:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
stuff like that because it's a big power
 
02:40:44.269 --> 02:40:44.279 align:start position:0%
source so uh there's some stuff that's
 
02:40:46.190 --> 02:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
talked about in the bill that you know
 
02:40:47.750 --> 02:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
is a little confusing and I'll and I'll
 
02:40:50.269 --> 02:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
go to that in a second so while some of
 
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
these you know it's like ventilation and
 
02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
air flow is what we're talking about so
 
02:40:56.670 --> 02:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
some of these mining protocols require
 
02:40:59.389 --> 02:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
um specialist Hardware others can be
 
02:41:01.469 --> 02:41:01.479 align:start position:0%
performed by anyone like on a decent
 
02:41:04.389 --> 02:41:04.399 align:start position:0%
home computer um that's usually lesser
 
02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
of um a couple of others allow for
 
02:41:09.510 --> 02:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
mining with smartphones um that's that's
 
02:41:12.429 --> 02:41:12.439 align:start position:0%
fairly newer each day like a new mining
 
02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
protocol emerges from the blockchain
 
02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
ecosystem many trying to kind of like
 
02:41:21.230 --> 02:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
tap into the latent computational power
 
02:41:22.990 --> 02:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
sitting in an average you know modern
 
02:41:25.309 --> 02:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
devices and computers however the
 
02:41:27.710 --> 02:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
profitability of some of these mining
 
02:41:30.349 --> 02:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
operations um you know it's not so
 
02:41:32.710 --> 02:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
rewarding uh it's usually done with
 
02:41:36.269 --> 02:41:36.279 align:start position:0%
larger entities uh which the fellow
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative will talk about so
 
02:41:41.790 --> 02:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
they've taken to um basically T so
 
02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of miners that will come
 
02:41:45.550 --> 02:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
together they'll group together uh and
 
02:41:48.429 --> 02:41:48.439 align:start position:0%
then work for a bigger
 
02:41:53.429 --> 02:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
entity so um so usually the process of
 
02:41:55.349 --> 02:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
like beginning mining is actually not
 
02:41:57.389 --> 02:41:57.399 align:start position:0%
really uh it's not difficult at all and
 
02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's not prohibited difficult um and
 
02:42:01.269 --> 02:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why this bill has been
 
02:42:05.230 --> 02:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
put into place so so after you acquire
 
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
like the appropriate Hardware um one can
 
02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
usually access uh like the software um
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
from a protocols website I got a lot of
 
02:42:16.990 --> 02:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
my information from a a it's they're
 
02:42:21.230 --> 02:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
called arer Digital Labs they are a um a
 
02:42:24.830 --> 02:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
company that's out of Australia so so
 
02:42:26.830 --> 02:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
you can get that from like I said a
 
02:42:28.870 --> 02:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
protocol's website or a company's
 
02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
website code repository and offer and
 
02:42:34.510 --> 02:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
often after like powering up you can
 
02:42:36.670 --> 02:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
start mining straight away and some of
 
02:42:38.550 --> 02:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
these things that you're purchasing are
 
02:42:42.670 --> 02:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
like going to run on their own so um so
 
02:42:44.790 --> 02:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's like you load into the software and
 
02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
then it does the work for you um so
 
02:42:50.429 --> 02:42:50.439 align:start position:0%
lastly because I know we're with time
 
02:42:53.309 --> 02:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
here um there's different types of
 
02:42:56.750 --> 02:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
mining so the proof ofof work mining is
 
02:42:58.469 --> 02:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
really what I wanted to talk about so
 
02:43:00.349 --> 02:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the original and most
 
02:43:02.469 --> 02:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
common form really the best form of
 
02:43:05.429 --> 02:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
mining so proof of work coins Le let's
 
02:43:07.269 --> 02:43:07.279 align:start position:0%
just say like Bitcoin some of the
 
02:43:09.389 --> 02:43:09.399 align:start position:0%
world's largest cryptocurrencies can be
 
02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
minded like Bitcoin Bitcoin ethereum
 
02:43:14.830 --> 02:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
Litecoin Dogecoin so for a bit of like
 
02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:15.950 align:start position:0%
Litecoin Dogecoin so for a bit of like
Conta

02:43:15.950 --> 02:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
Conta
 
02:43:18.910 --> 02:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
blockchains keep their Ledges secure and
 
02:43:21.790 --> 02:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
immutable using consensus algorithms
 
02:43:23.750 --> 02:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
systems that ensure that the majority of
 
02:43:26.110 --> 02:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
the network agrees on a list of
 
02:43:29.190 --> 02:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
transactions and events proof of work is
 
02:43:32.429 --> 02:43:32.439 align:start position:0%
one of those consensus algorithms so by
 
02:43:34.710 --> 02:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
expending a large amount of processing
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
power guessing the solution to a
 
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
difficult uh crypto graph
 
02:43:44.030 --> 02:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
cryptography oh sorry problem miners
 
02:43:46.469 --> 02:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
that correctly guess the answer first
 
02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
can earn the right to add a new block to
 
02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
the chain a correct guess and a valid
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
block added to the chain rewards the
 
02:43:56.469 --> 02:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
minor with a certain amount of
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency so I'm going to give you
 
02:44:00.070 --> 02:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
in December of
 
02:44:03.550 --> 02:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
2021 um Bitcoin miners for example were
 
02:44:06.590 --> 02:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
rewarded with like 6.25 Bitcoin for
 
02:44:10.269 --> 02:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
adding a block to the chain so since the
 
02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
global computational work effort uh
 
02:44:15.750 --> 02:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me since the global computational
 
02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
effort being spent on proof of work
 
02:44:20.590 --> 02:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
mining is so great it's common as I said
 
02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
earlier for smaller miners to join um
 
02:44:26.070 --> 02:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
others in pools where their combined
 
02:44:28.349 --> 02:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
effort is more likely to yield more
 
02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
consistent rewards they can share so the
 
02:44:35.790 --> 02:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
last um thing I will say is you know the
 
02:44:38.110 --> 02:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
difference between proof of work is like
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
you could talk about distributed um
 
02:44:42.590 --> 02:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
Computing that's like the ne next
 
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
largest sector of digital asset mining
 
02:44:48.110 --> 02:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
outside of proof of work um by market
 
02:44:51.630 --> 02:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
cap um and that is basically it's a form
 
02:44:54.309 --> 02:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
of distributed computing so for the
 
02:44:57.230 --> 02:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
purpose of what I'm reading um you're
 
02:44:58.950 --> 02:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
going to I'm going to Define that as
 
02:45:00.590 --> 02:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
like the internet spread across a
 
02:45:03.670 --> 02:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
network with utility Beyond securing a
 
02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
blockchain's transaction data and adding
 
02:45:08.990 --> 02:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
blocks to a blockchain so the the field
 
02:45:11.710 --> 02:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
of digital asset mining in itself is
 
02:45:14.110 --> 02:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
very diverse um you know distributed
 
02:45:16.590 --> 02:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
files storage you know hotly contested
 
02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
Market distributed app hosting content
 
02:45:22.389 --> 02:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
serving um and they have a their own
 
02:45:24.710 --> 02:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
sector of cryptocurrencies and
 
02:45:26.950 --> 02:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
distributed rendering is emerging with
 
02:45:29.670 --> 02:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
potential for growth to serve alongside
 
02:45:32.750 --> 02:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
metaverse I think the most important
 
02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:43.070 --> 02:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
bill is line six item
 
02:45:46.110 --> 02:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
two any person engaged in home digital
 
02:45:47.950 --> 02:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
asset mining or digital asset mining
 
02:45:51.429 --> 02:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
business shall not be considered a money
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
transmitter under RSA 399 G that's the
 
02:45:58.990 --> 02:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
most important part of this bill because
 
02:46:03.309 --> 02:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
this is not about transmitting money and
 
02:46:06.510 --> 02:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
I had to educate myself on it because as
 
02:46:08.910 --> 02:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
I told fellow representative uh who I
 
02:46:11.030 --> 02:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
begged to speak on
 
02:46:14.429 --> 02:46:14.439 align:start position:0%
this I said this is like a foreign
 
02:46:17.590 --> 02:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
language to me and I will definitely
 
02:46:21.030 --> 02:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
email my testimony um but the reason why
 
02:46:24.550 --> 02:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
I put this in is for like I said a
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
constituent um that is very interested
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
in this and is I I you know in another
 
02:46:34.990 --> 02:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
state he was in was working on this and
 
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
wants to do this here and just kind of
 
02:46:41.190 --> 02:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
wants to be protected for it um in this
 
02:46:45.070 --> 02:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
latest of technology so I think that's
 
02:46:47.990 --> 02:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:50.269 --> 02:46:50.279 align:start position:0%
say uh that's great I'm glad you pointed
 
02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
that out um and clearly I put this in
 
02:46:54.750 --> 02:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
the wrong grouping because we have a
 
02:46:55.830 --> 02:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
whole another day where we're going to
 
02:46:58.469 --> 02:46:58.479 align:start position:0%
be dealing with money the money trans oh
 
02:47:01.269 --> 02:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
really yeah so I I I screwed up and I if
 
02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
I had seen that I would have put it in
 
02:47:05.550 --> 02:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
there but all I saw was local digital
 
02:47:09.030 --> 02:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
Mining and so is that what the zoning is
 
02:47:15.750 --> 02:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
so uh she in terms of um the zoning goes
 
02:47:17.389 --> 02:47:17.399 align:start position:0%
through all kinds of things you I mean
 
02:47:18.750 --> 02:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
there's there's there's something that's
 
02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
re you the Pu does did you know sets
 
02:47:26.550 --> 02:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
rates you know zoning but we don't know
 
02:47:28.269 --> 02:47:28.279 align:start position:0%
if there's actually been a zoning
 
02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
problem have we ever had anybody who got
 
02:47:33.070 --> 02:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
told they couldn't do digital mining in
 
02:47:35.429 --> 02:47:35.439 align:start position:0%
a town so it's really not a zoning issue
 
02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
the money transmitter issue is is I can
 
02:47:41.710 --> 02:47:41.720 align:start position:0%
see that potentially being a problem um
 
02:47:44.750 --> 02:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
and uh but uh ironically I can tell you
 
02:47:46.150 --> 02:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
that that the bank Department would
 
02:47:48.110 --> 02:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
never do that because the bank
 
02:47:50.990 --> 02:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
Department was very adamant that
 
02:47:54.990 --> 02:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency is not money okay it's a
 
02:47:57.910 --> 02:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
commodity and so they would never ever
 
02:48:01.070 --> 02:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
try to regulate uh cryptocurrency it as
 
02:48:03.630 --> 02:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
a as a matter of fact we specifically
 
02:48:06.590 --> 02:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
took the statute that did relate to it
 
02:48:08.630 --> 02:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
and repealed it correct several years
 
02:48:11.389 --> 02:48:11.399 align:start position:0%
ago so um in that sense if you're
 
02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
worried about that I can't imagine that
 
02:48:15.590 --> 02:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
being an issue but I
 
02:48:17.150 --> 02:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
we could we do have a money transmitter
 
02:48:19.110 --> 02:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
Bill we canop throw that in there if
 
02:48:21.309 --> 02:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
that's if it's an issue but other than
 
02:48:24.070 --> 02:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
that I mean uh um if you don't have any
 
02:48:27.710 --> 02:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
actual zoning problems then we'll we can
 
02:48:29.910 --> 02:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
figure out how to but like I say the
 
02:48:31.349 --> 02:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
money transmitters should not should be
 
02:48:34.110 --> 02:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
a non-issue because we we made a whole
 
02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
point that that that the banking
 
02:48:38.590 --> 02:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
department does not regulate
 
02:48:40.950 --> 02:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency correct in this process
 
02:48:43.110 --> 02:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
the the digital asset mining is is
 
02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
actually it's it's not transmitting
 
02:48:45.950 --> 02:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
money it's not that's not what they're
 
02:48:47.670 --> 02:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
doing exactly so whoever thought whoever
 
02:48:50.910 --> 02:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
said was worried about that it's really
 
02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
I I can't imagine they never been found
 
02:48:54.309 --> 02:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
I mean are they are they registering as
 
02:48:57.750 --> 02:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
a money transmitter now no yeah no so
 
02:49:00.389 --> 02:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
this is not this is not problem so the
 
02:49:02.790 --> 02:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
the last thing I wanted to say before um
 
02:49:04.990 --> 02:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
and then if there's any other questions
 
02:49:08.269 --> 02:49:08.279 align:start position:0%
um so of course as we know you know
 
02:49:10.349 --> 02:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
we've got statutes laws that are on the
 
02:49:11.510 --> 02:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
books that have been on the books for a
 
02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
long time right so we're talking about
 
02:49:16.429 --> 02:49:16.439 align:start position:0%
very modern day type things where you
 
02:49:18.389 --> 02:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
know there's still certain laws on the
 
02:49:21.389 --> 02:49:21.399 align:start position:0%
books that that when you slip something
 
02:49:24.550 --> 02:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
in um you know that it applies so I just
 
02:49:26.190 --> 02:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
have to say that if you look at line
 
02:49:28.070 --> 02:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
number nine where it talks about
 
02:49:29.990 --> 02:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
limiting the sound decibel and stuff
 
02:49:33.429 --> 02:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
like that so think of um think of back
 
02:49:36.110 --> 02:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
in the day when we had there were
 
02:49:38.269 --> 02:49:38.279 align:start position:0%
humongous computer system I get to stop
 
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
you this is a zoning issue correct but
 
02:49:43.389 --> 02:49:43.399 align:start position:0%
okay so zoning right now they have they
 
02:49:46.750 --> 02:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
do have regulations I mean of is about
 
02:49:49.870 --> 02:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
decb okay so to say is well would they
 
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
change that would they say well because
 
02:49:55.870 --> 02:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
you're doing this particular Enterprise
 
02:49:58.030 --> 02:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
different from the zoning debate we had
 
02:50:01.710 --> 02:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
in my town which was was atire Warehouse
 
02:50:03.269 --> 02:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
that has a drill that
 
02:50:06.349 --> 02:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
goes was that was that auto repair or
 
02:50:08.309 --> 02:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
not and why were they complaining about
 
02:50:11.670 --> 02:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
the sound okay so that zoning you know
 
02:50:14.950 --> 02:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
for us is to get into you know to
 
02:50:17.670 --> 02:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
debating zoning in terms of sound and
 
02:50:20.710 --> 02:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
Zoning you know that that's already set
 
02:50:22.710 --> 02:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
and that's that's lots of case law
 
02:50:24.590 --> 02:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
around that already but I just wanted to
 
02:50:26.630 --> 02:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
tell you that OS specifically we had
 
02:50:27.870 --> 02:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
this conversation right I'm like how
 
02:50:30.550 --> 02:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
does the supply this goes based upon old
 
02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
computers so if you look at B based upon
 
02:50:34.469 --> 02:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
like NASA computers back in the day
 
02:50:36.389 --> 02:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
those big huge I mean they would take up
 
02:50:38.950 --> 02:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
you dream right they were loud that
 
02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply anymore so that's the
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
reason why this is in here of decb it
 
02:50:44.990 --> 02:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't even apply but it's old it's
 
02:50:46.590 --> 02:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
like old stuff that's still on the books
 
02:50:48.389 --> 02:50:48.399 align:start position:0%
is why I wanted to you're saying there
 
02:50:50.750 --> 02:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
is that's no that's not on the books
 
02:50:52.950 --> 02:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
there's no there never it was never any
 
02:50:56.590 --> 02:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
regulation of noisy computers I can say
 
02:50:57.790 --> 02:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
that because I was in the personal
 
02:51:00.229 --> 02:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
computer business for a long period of
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
time so I can tell you that uh if
 
02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
anybody was to complain that I mean
 
02:51:06.830 --> 02:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
there was no no zoning regulation Rel
 
02:51:08.389 --> 02:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
related to that but there are there are
 
02:51:10.469 --> 02:51:10.479 align:start position:0%
local noise ordinances so that's why
 
02:51:11.870 --> 02:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
they put this in here because they're
 
02:51:13.510 --> 02:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
going based upon like this would be
 
02:51:15.070 --> 02:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
something that would be loud I'm saying
 
02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
there's no sound on local the noise I've
 
02:51:19.229 --> 02:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
never seen one that had anything to do
 
02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
with computers or Electronics all I've
 
02:51:25.429 --> 02:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
seen was the one I know about
 
02:51:29.070 --> 02:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
was okay when when it comes to Tire okay
 
02:51:31.710 --> 02:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
so yes Town some towns definitely have
 
02:51:34.590 --> 02:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
sound decimal ordinances yes and that
 
02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
and that would means where your Zone
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
where you can do those activities but
 
02:51:43.030 --> 02:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay we you guys really have questions
 
02:51:45.670 --> 02:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
for very very quick question
 
02:51:47.349 --> 02:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
representative buroughs has a question
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
um just quick question have you talked
 
02:51:52.309 --> 02:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
to anyone at Dees or any other any other
 
02:51:54.389 --> 02:51:54.399 align:start position:0%
organizations deals with environmental
 
02:51:56.950 --> 02:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about what the impact may be of
 
02:51:56.960 --> 02:51:58.830 align:start position:0%
concerns about what the impact may be of
digital

02:51:58.830 --> 02:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
digital
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
mining no because the only um the only
 
02:52:03.309 --> 02:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
time that you would have any sort of
 
02:52:05.590 --> 02:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
environmental impact would be if if
 
02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about and I can show you
 
02:52:10.750 --> 02:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
pictures of where there are big large
 
02:52:13.550 --> 02:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
companies that have you know uh their
 
02:52:15.590 --> 02:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
Stacks basically of servers that are
 
02:52:18.389 --> 02:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
running and that would be that's mainly
 
02:52:21.550 --> 02:52:21.560 align:start position:0%
for um the
 
02:52:23.510 --> 02:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
power actually takes a lot of
 
02:52:25.950 --> 02:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
electricity the biggest noise maker is
 
02:52:28.389 --> 02:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
the cooling correct because you have
 
02:52:29.910 --> 02:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's all about
 
02:52:32.590 --> 02:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
Cooling and and and big refrigerator
 
02:52:34.590 --> 02:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
units and big cooler units just like you
 
02:52:37.190 --> 02:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
see outside of of a but that's not in
 
02:52:39.630 --> 02:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
somebody's home I'm that's big that
 
02:52:41.229 --> 02:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
those are big companies that are doing
 
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
that that are literally stacking up
 
02:52:45.389 --> 02:52:45.399 align:start position:0%
supercomputers to do this we don't we
 
02:52:47.870 --> 02:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
don't have that so they would have to
 
02:52:50.110 --> 02:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
follow all of our current regulations
 
02:52:52.870 --> 02:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
which there are some um there are some
 
02:52:54.910 --> 02:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
companies so I'm not even there yet with
 
02:52:56.790 --> 02:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
Dees because those would already fall
 
02:52:59.309 --> 02:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
under um all of those environmental
 
02:53:01.110 --> 02:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
things if you're if you're building a
 
02:53:02.830 --> 02:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
you know you're building a business of
 
02:53:04.750 --> 02:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
this here in the state representative
 
02:53:08.309 --> 02:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
Gibs thank you Mr chairman uh noise
 
02:53:11.550 --> 02:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
issues aside isn't uh digital asset
 
02:53:15.229 --> 02:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
mining highly energy intensive
 
02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
correct it is so there's so for example
 
02:53:22.190 --> 02:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
um but those people that are doing it
 
02:53:24.030 --> 02:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
are paying for it so if this is
 
02:53:25.190 --> 02:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
something that you want to put in your
 
02:53:27.870 --> 02:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
home um there's certain times of the day
 
02:53:30.950 --> 02:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
of course um that that are running that
 
02:53:33.910 --> 02:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
are you know uh less cost for
 
02:53:35.910 --> 02:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
electricity and things like that but
 
02:53:38.070 --> 02:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
that is of course on the person that is
 
02:53:40.070 --> 02:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
um they have to take that on right
 
02:53:43.389 --> 02:53:43.399 align:start position:0%
follow clearly that's a pu that's a pu
 
02:53:46.150 --> 02:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
issue it's not a zoning issue yes
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
question okay follow-up question uh and
 
02:53:50.830 --> 02:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
this is related to representative
 
02:53:53.550 --> 02:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
Burrow's question if something is highly
 
02:53:57.070 --> 02:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
energy intensive uh aside from the cost
 
02:54:00.070 --> 02:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
to the user might not there isn't there
 
02:54:03.790 --> 02:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
also an environmental cost to adding
 
02:54:06.790 --> 02:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
something that is highly energy
 
02:54:09.190 --> 02:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
intensive well because of the high cost
 
02:54:11.030 --> 02:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
of energy especially that we experience
 
02:54:13.590 --> 02:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if someone is going to
 
02:54:16.030 --> 02:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
do this they they have there's a lot of
 
02:54:18.150 --> 02:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
different options for them with using
 
02:54:20.030 --> 02:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
other types of energy that can help them
 
02:54:23.670 --> 02:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
for to to offset the cost so I can
 
02:54:24.870 --> 02:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
provide that and do a little bit of
 
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
research I did not go down that for
 
02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
other um for other entities other states
 
02:54:31.950 --> 02:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
countries that are doing this using you
 
02:54:34.469 --> 02:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
know solar using geothermal using those
 
02:54:36.790 --> 02:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
things like that which basically makes
 
02:54:40.309 --> 02:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
um you know they they're almost a null
 
02:54:42.710 --> 02:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
so cuz it's being it's being provided
 
02:54:45.110 --> 02:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
for from actually some of those energy
 
02:54:49.469 --> 02:54:49.479 align:start position:0%
efficient ways it's a quick question uh
 
02:54:52.590 --> 02:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
really we have zoning laws that Rec that
 
02:54:54.990 --> 02:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
talk about the uh the sound like we
 
02:54:57.269 --> 02:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
talked about is there any belief that
 
02:55:00.830 --> 02:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
the these uh mining operations could not
 
02:55:02.910 --> 02:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
meet those zoning
 
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
laws not not to my knowledge so why do
 
02:55:10.750 --> 02:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:13.389 --> 02:55:13.399 align:start position:0%
them what do you mean why do you want
 
02:55:15.870 --> 02:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
she's asking why why is this bill here
 
02:55:18.750 --> 02:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
if there's no actual zoning regulation
 
02:55:21.030 --> 02:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
or anything going
 
02:55:25.070 --> 02:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
on okay because because you know
 
02:55:27.590 --> 02:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
perception is reality right so we we're
 
02:55:30.910 --> 02:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
putting something in basically making
 
02:55:32.910 --> 02:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
sure that this can happen here in the
 
02:55:34.349 --> 02:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
state they're still going to have to
 
02:55:36.510 --> 02:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
follow under all our regulations under
 
02:55:38.990 --> 02:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
all our zoning but they should right
 
02:55:41.870 --> 02:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
correct and they should
 
02:55:44.830 --> 02:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
um okay I I think a lot lot of this has
 
02:55:47.750 --> 02:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
to do with the unknown aspect of this
 
02:55:51.070 --> 02:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
new emerging uh computational business
 
02:55:53.110 --> 02:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
and technology and I and for those
 
02:55:55.469 --> 02:55:55.479 align:start position:0%
reasons this is the the bill that's put
 
02:55:57.670 --> 02:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
in there's a there's a bill in Missouri
 
02:56:00.510 --> 02:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
for example that passed um that is
 
02:56:02.790 --> 02:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
identical that has the digital mining
 
02:56:06.389 --> 02:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
part of it as well as um uh as well as
 
02:56:09.349 --> 02:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
some of the currency pieces so this is
 
02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
just this is really just protecting a
 
02:56:14.349 --> 02:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
new and emerging industry and um and
 
02:56:15.790 --> 02:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
making sure that they're allowed if
 
02:56:17.630 --> 02:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
someone wants to be able to do this that
 
02:56:21.469 --> 02:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
they have um um preventative
 
02:56:23.630 --> 02:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
preventative legislation okay
 
02:56:26.190 --> 02:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
representative Anon I I just wanted to
 
02:56:28.710 --> 02:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
do uh would you believe uh would you
 
02:56:31.790 --> 02:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
believe that uh digital asset mining is
 
02:56:33.870 --> 02:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
actually could actually be beneficial to
 
02:56:37.469 --> 02:56:37.479 align:start position:0%
the grid because it it uh it uh
 
02:56:40.309 --> 02:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
encourages over production of of
 
02:56:43.670 --> 02:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
generation and can be a flexible load on
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
the grid so that when there when
 
02:56:48.269 --> 02:56:48.279 align:start position:0%
windmills and solar panels are producing
 
02:56:50.870 --> 02:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
electricity that the grid doesn't need
 
02:56:52.830 --> 02:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
it can go into digital asset Mining and
 
02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
actually subsidize those projects and uh
 
02:56:57.830 --> 02:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
if you look at the governor's crypto
 
02:56:58.990 --> 02:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
commission report there's a whole
 
02:57:01.510 --> 02:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
section on digital asset we had experts
 
02:57:04.190 --> 02:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
come in and testify about how it can be
 
02:57:06.790 --> 02:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
a tool to make the grid even Greener
 
02:57:08.389 --> 02:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
which is kind of counterintuitive to the
 
02:57:11.349 --> 02:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
narrative so would you believe no I do
 
02:57:13.030 --> 02:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
well I do believe and I think that's
 
02:57:14.469 --> 02:57:14.479 align:start position:0%
fantastic and I'm glad glad that you
 
02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
pointed that out because I will cut
 
02:57:19.830 --> 02:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
those sections and then send that out to
 
02:57:21.710 --> 02:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
um just for further support of this
 
02:57:23.150 --> 02:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
because we have to have all sides on
 
02:57:25.469 --> 02:57:25.479 align:start position:0%
this which would be great okay thank you
 
02:57:30.110 --> 02:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
very much thank you uh all right so um
 
02:57:31.990 --> 02:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
Matt you want to come up
 
02:57:34.990 --> 02:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
and please don't take five
 
02:57:37.790 --> 02:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
minutes well I'll be quick but all right
 
02:57:41.110 --> 02:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
so I was asked to uh come testify and
 
02:57:43.309 --> 02:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and I think the
 
02:57:45.550 --> 02:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
noise stuff and all that's a little bit
 
02:57:47.469 --> 02:57:47.479 align:start position:0%
uh absurd just it's computers how much
 
02:57:49.349 --> 02:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
noise can these things make it's the air
 
02:57:52.150 --> 02:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
conditioning units to cool them okay um
 
02:57:55.030 --> 02:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
but the the the bill the part that I
 
02:57:57.389 --> 02:57:57.399 align:start position:0%
really want to testify in support of is
 
02:57:59.590 --> 02:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh line six any person engag in home
 
02:58:01.110 --> 02:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
digital asset mining or digital asset
 
02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
mining business shall not be considered
 
02:58:06.150 --> 02:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
a money transmitter um so I actually
 
02:58:08.309 --> 02:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
think it is valuable because the
 
02:58:10.269 --> 02:58:10.279 align:start position:0%
government has this tendency to treat
 
02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency as money when it's
 
02:58:14.630 --> 02:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
convenient to them and and commodity
 
02:58:15.990 --> 02:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
when it's convenient to them when
 
02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting people I am very proud to
 
02:58:20.150 --> 02:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
say that this
 
02:58:23.670 --> 02:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
committee went out of its way to
 
02:58:23.680 --> 02:58:25.190 align:start position:0%
committee went out of its way to
absolutely

02:58:25.190 --> 02:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:58:28.349 --> 02:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
remove cryptocurrency from the banking
 
02:58:31.229 --> 02:58:31.239 align:start position:0%
Department who was regulating as money
 
02:58:33.349 --> 02:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
transmitters and we have that
 
02:58:35.670 --> 02:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
legislation is got to be going on five
 
02:58:37.590 --> 02:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
years now it was a while ago we passed
 
02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
that we made it was under my name so let
 
02:58:43.389 --> 02:58:43.399 align:start position:0%
me let me just tell you I'm damn sure of
 
02:58:44.590 --> 02:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
what we did
 
02:58:48.030 --> 02:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
okay and that is that no it it is that
 
02:58:49.269 --> 02:58:49.279 align:start position:0%
the banking Department doesn't want to
 
02:58:51.670 --> 02:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
have anything the B Money transmitter
 
02:58:53.910 --> 02:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
like legislation they don't want to have
 
02:58:55.630 --> 02:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
anything to do with cryptocurrency as a
 
02:58:57.150 --> 02:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
matter of fact we took it out if you go
 
02:59:00.269 --> 02:59:00.279 align:start position:0%
onto their web page right now they'll
 
02:59:02.870 --> 02:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
tell you if you have a cryptocurrency
 
02:59:04.830 --> 02:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
problem call the Attorney General's
 
02:59:08.150 --> 02:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
office we do not have anything to do
 
02:59:11.870 --> 02:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
with crypto okay uh but when someone's
 
02:59:13.630 --> 02:59:13.640 align:start position:0%
being prosecuted for this you know just
 
02:59:16.269 --> 02:59:16.279 align:start position:0%
have having that in there might be a
 
02:59:19.309 --> 02:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
defense that they can use I mean there
 
02:59:20.590 --> 02:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of CA there's a lot of
 
02:59:22.469 --> 02:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
questions about this a prosecutor could
 
02:59:25.229 --> 02:59:25.239 align:start position:0%
argue that Bitcoin mining or
 
02:59:26.790 --> 02:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency mining is money
 
02:59:30.349 --> 02:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
transmission I that is in theory it is
 
02:59:32.670 --> 02:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
but I'm just telling you under our
 
02:59:35.070 --> 02:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
statutes that is physically impossible
 
02:59:37.269 --> 02:59:37.279 align:start position:0%
to occur the Attorney General's office
 
02:59:40.030 --> 02:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
would never use that because they know
 
02:59:43.309 --> 02:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
full well that we have removed any
 
02:59:45.229 --> 02:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
reference to to cryptocurrency from the
 
02:59:45.239 --> 02:59:46.870 align:start position:0%
reference to to cryptocurrency from the
money

02:59:46.870 --> 02:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:59:48.990 --> 02:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
transfer uh
 
02:59:51.110 --> 02:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
statute and I will get it I'll get you a
 
02:59:53.389 --> 02:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
copy of it all right well I'll will get
 
02:59:55.110 --> 02:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
you a copy was I sponsored the bill so I
 
02:59:56.910 --> 02:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
know that we did
 
03:00:00.790 --> 03:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
this uh yeah I I I agree but I mean it's
 
03:00:03.429 --> 03:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
not like it's not like you know the
 
03:00:05.830 --> 03:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
prosecution's always uh you know
 
03:00:07.510 --> 03:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes it could be disingenuous
 
03:00:11.429 --> 03:00:11.439 align:start position:0%
workers you know so just man come on
 
03:00:14.229 --> 03:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
come on come come on let's give let's
 
03:00:16.990 --> 03:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
give our statute some Integrity okay
 
03:00:18.990 --> 03:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
they do they hold law and our attorney
 
03:00:20.389 --> 03:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
general you know who's who was here
 
03:00:22.990 --> 03:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
earlier okay who the consumer protection
 
03:00:25.590 --> 03:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
division their mission in life just so
 
03:00:28.269 --> 03:00:28.279 align:start position:0%
you know the consumer protection statute
 
03:00:30.710 --> 03:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that if a consumer's been
 
03:00:34.630 --> 03:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
harmed is to make sure that that you are
 
03:00:37.269 --> 03:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
been made whole okay it's it's really
 
03:00:40.429 --> 03:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
about restitution okay uh so this is
 
03:00:42.229 --> 03:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
sort of unorthodox I was going to
 
03:00:45.030 --> 03:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
testify on why digital asset mining is
 
03:00:47.510 --> 03:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
not money transmission we absolutely
 
03:00:49.670 --> 03:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
agree in this commit this this the
 
03:00:52.150 --> 03:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
legislature is on record to agree with
 
03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:53.710 align:start position:0%
legislature is on record to agree with
you

03:00:53.710 --> 03:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:00:58.190 --> 03:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
100% okay uh still very unorthodox uh
 
03:01:00.630 --> 03:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
testimony but thank you for your
 
03:01:02.950 --> 03:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
time okay we do have a question for you
 
03:01:06.150 --> 03:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
I have a question yes digital mining
 
03:01:09.510 --> 03:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
business is a business so you can't
 
03:01:13.190 --> 03:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
allow the cities don't allow businesses
 
03:01:15.990 --> 03:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
in uh local districts that are you know
 
03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:17.309 align:start position:0%
in uh local districts that are you know
just

03:01:17.309 --> 03:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:01:19.469 --> 03:01:19.479 align:start position:0%
housing it has to be in a business
 
03:01:22.150 --> 03:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
district I I was going to testify on
 
03:01:25.030 --> 03:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
this but it's I'm kind of getting kicked
 
03:01:26.830 --> 03:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
out I mean you could go on and talk
 
03:01:28.269 --> 03:01:28.279 align:start position:0%
about something else I I just wanted to
 
03:01:30.349 --> 03:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
make sure don't don't focus on the money
 
03:01:33.190 --> 03:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
transmitter issue you you have you want
 
03:01:34.830 --> 03:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
to testify about
 
03:01:37.269 --> 03:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
business well one of the things that
 
03:01:39.110 --> 03:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
crypto currency people are concerned
 
03:01:40.150 --> 03:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
about is
 
03:01:42.510 --> 03:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
decentralization so that so it
 
03:01:44.590 --> 03:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
particularly says in home asset digital
 
03:01:48.190 --> 03:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
mining uh they want to protect basically
 
03:01:50.910 --> 03:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
small users that's what it looks like
 
03:01:52.229 --> 03:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
the intent of this is to protect small
 
03:01:55.309 --> 03:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
users that may have a very small like
 
03:01:57.590 --> 03:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
just one computer uh at their home and
 
03:01:59.030 --> 03:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
they want to mine with it they don't
 
03:02:00.429 --> 03:02:00.439 align:start position:0%
want that to be considered money
 
03:02:02.950 --> 03:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
transmission so this decentralization is
 
03:02:04.750 --> 03:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
like very important to these
 
03:02:07.830 --> 03:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency people they want multiple
 
03:02:09.590 --> 03:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
users to be working on this instead of
 
03:02:11.590 --> 03:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
just a concentration of it and and
 
03:02:16.150 --> 03:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:20.110 --> 03:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
thanks okay any other questions do you
 
03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
have any other testimony you want to
 
03:02:24.910 --> 03:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
offer up nope great thank you very much
 
03:02:33.269 --> 03:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
Horgan I have some I have some written
 
03:02:38.110 --> 03:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
testimony okay so just for the committee
 
03:02:39.750 --> 03:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
my what we're going to do is we're
 
03:02:42.110 --> 03:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
basically we'll we'll break after this
 
03:02:44.070 --> 03:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
for lunch and we'll just push everything
 
03:02:49.990 --> 03:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:52.950 --> 03:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
well I I'm way I looked at it was that
 
03:02:56.030 --> 03:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
the snowstorm is pretty late in the
 
03:02:56.040 --> 03:02:57.590 align:start position:0%
the snowstorm is pretty late in the
day

03:02:57.590 --> 03:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:03:02.830 --> 03:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:05.750 --> 03:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
know okay go ahead Tim thank you very
 
03:03:08.030 --> 03:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
much I'm can be resident Timothy Oregon
 
03:03:09.870 --> 03:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
I continue unless something unexpected
 
03:03:11.630 --> 03:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
happened to represent straford County
 
03:03:14.590 --> 03:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
district 6 um 10 used to be six the town
 
03:03:17.830 --> 03:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
of Durham and
 
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
um we've heard a lot of explanation the
 
03:03:22.990 --> 03:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
bill represented of uh my gentle lady
 
03:03:25.150 --> 03:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
from Rochester put a lot of uh lot of
 
03:03:28.190 --> 03:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
work into it so she did job of telling
 
03:03:29.950 --> 03:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
us like what it's about it attempts to
 
03:03:32.389 --> 03:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
give digital asset mining companies
 
03:03:34.030 --> 03:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
special privileges in my opinion which
 
03:03:35.910 --> 03:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
other business do good and it's mostly
 
03:03:40.389 --> 03:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
about uh zoning regulations but I'll
 
03:03:42.229 --> 03:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
first I I'll skip to the last paragraph
 
03:03:43.670 --> 03:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
of my prepared testimony about the the
 
03:03:45.110 --> 03:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
money transmission because we're just
 
03:03:47.309 --> 03:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
talking about it um
 
03:03:51.630 --> 03:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
I I think this uh this this provision
 
03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
appears to be unnecessary so that's a
 
03:03:55.229 --> 03:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
another enough reason right there to
 
03:03:57.510 --> 03:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
take it out but I also
 
03:04:01.670 --> 03:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh also think this could be used you
 
03:04:03.190 --> 03:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
could have businesses that would be
 
03:04:05.150 --> 03:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
money transmitters might just put in a
 
03:04:08.309 --> 03:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
digital asset mining um you know just
 
03:04:10.910 --> 03:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
put a crypto server or whatever on after
 
03:04:12.429 --> 03:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
your property then claim they're exempt
 
03:04:13.630 --> 03:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
from it so that's probably another
 
03:04:16.990 --> 03:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
reason to take it out um I I certainly
 
03:04:19.469 --> 03:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
support internate homebased internet
 
03:04:22.269 --> 03:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
businesses I ran I guess I'm still
 
03:04:24.590 --> 03:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
running it a little bit myself um and
 
03:04:27.269 --> 03:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
actually virtual currency was part of it
 
03:04:28.870 --> 03:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
it was a virtual world where they had a
 
03:04:31.309 --> 03:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
micro payment system where people put
 
03:04:32.910 --> 03:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
real money you
 
03:04:35.349 --> 03:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
know put real money into it and then
 
03:04:37.229 --> 03:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
they use the virtual dollars this is in
 
03:04:38.990 --> 03:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
Second Life what they call Lyon dollars
 
03:04:40.590 --> 03:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
they're using that as a micro payment
 
03:04:43.070 --> 03:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
system sometimes very micro micro
 
03:04:45.550 --> 03:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
payment a lot of my things I was buying
 
03:04:48.030 --> 03:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
or selling were like would be about like
 
03:04:51.429 --> 03:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
a few cents in real money and that um I
 
03:04:54.349 --> 03:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
said I certainly um wouldn't think
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
people who are running uh businesses and
 
03:04:57.950 --> 03:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
second life any virtual should be money
 
03:04:59.870 --> 03:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
transmitters and we were using third
 
03:05:03.030 --> 03:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
party uh party vendors so I'm sure that
 
03:05:05.309 --> 03:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
that would be a non-issue um also of
 
03:05:08.150 --> 03:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
course in that case and people run out
 
03:05:09.750 --> 03:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
do all kinds of B run all kinds of
 
03:05:10.990 --> 03:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
business out of their homes and that
 
03:05:12.750 --> 03:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
should be protected and maybe we do need
 
03:05:15.070 --> 03:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
a law to clarify that I don't know what
 
03:05:16.710 --> 03:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
this is the vehicle to do it or even the
 
03:05:17.950 --> 03:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
committee that should be doing but
 
03:05:21.070 --> 03:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely that should be allowable and
 
03:05:22.750 --> 03:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
I really don't know of any Community
 
03:05:25.389 --> 03:05:25.399 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire which is uh
 
03:05:26.590 --> 03:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
discouraging through the zoning
 
03:05:28.150 --> 03:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
regulations or anything else from people
 
03:05:29.510 --> 03:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
just running you know sitting at their
 
03:05:32.349 --> 03:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
computer and running a uh inter a
 
03:05:35.590 --> 03:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
business over the Internet um
 
03:05:39.070 --> 03:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
the digital asset mining these servers
 
03:05:42.750 --> 03:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh that's could be a separate issue i'
 
03:05:44.030 --> 03:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
I've certainly considered doing that
 
03:05:45.510 --> 03:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
I've looked into schemes actually was
 
03:05:47.469 --> 03:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
looking at the what the Archer digital
 
03:05:49.349 --> 03:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
side in Australia which we heard about a
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
few minutes ago and I looked all the
 
03:05:55.110 --> 03:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
schemes and they all seem like a waste
 
03:05:56.670 --> 03:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
of time to me and also waste of
 
03:05:58.870 --> 03:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
electricity so none of them frankly I
 
03:06:00.990 --> 03:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
don't none of think really
 
03:06:03.469 --> 03:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
added I wouldn't be adding any value to
 
03:06:05.790 --> 03:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
the economy by participating them and
 
03:06:08.590 --> 03:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
frankly I think that's the uh frankly I
 
03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
think that's the case with crypto I know
 
03:06:11.870 --> 03:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
people are making real money out of it I
 
03:06:13.389 --> 03:06:13.399 align:start position:0%
know it's new and groovy and there a
 
03:06:17.070 --> 03:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
very fascinating technology um but I'm
 
03:06:19.950 --> 03:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
not uh I'm not sure if that's something
 
03:06:22.150 --> 03:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
the state needs to go out of its way to
 
03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
actively encourage it should be legal
 
03:06:26.950 --> 03:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
but I I'm just a skeptic about it I just
 
03:06:30.110 --> 03:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
don't I just think uh I just think a lot
 
03:06:31.990 --> 03:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the claims for it are overblown and
 
03:06:35.110 --> 03:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
the only value that I can see to
 
03:06:36.870 --> 03:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
especially cryptocurrency is if you can
 
03:06:39.269 --> 03:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
sell it to somebody else and get real
 
03:06:41.030 --> 03:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
currency for it so I don't see how it
 
03:06:43.790 --> 03:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
has any larger value I mean you can use
 
03:06:47.750 --> 03:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
it as a um medium medium of exchange um
 
03:06:49.229 --> 03:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
you can even use the store of value
 
03:06:50.150 --> 03:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
though I don't think it's a very good
 
03:06:51.469 --> 03:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
store of value because there's some
 
03:06:53.110 --> 03:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
technical issues and also like it's very
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
volatile but that that's just me if you
 
03:06:55.990 --> 03:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
want to do it you certainly should be
 
03:06:57.590 --> 03:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
able to do it and you should be able to
 
03:06:59.590 --> 03:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
do it out of out of your home but I
 
03:07:00.790 --> 03:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
03:07:03.469 --> 03:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think it's a good idea to
 
03:07:05.190 --> 03:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh exempt them from local zoning
 
03:07:06.790 --> 03:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
regulations because I can see all kinds
 
03:07:09.110 --> 03:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
of situations where somebody's you know
 
03:07:11.670 --> 03:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
mining crypto or doing you know doing
 
03:07:13.550 --> 03:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
whatever running a very noisy server
 
03:07:15.349 --> 03:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
that uses a lot of electricity maybe
 
03:07:17.389 --> 03:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
creates other externalities um
 
03:07:18.670 --> 03:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities should be able to
 
03:07:21.110 --> 03:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
regulate that and also the way the bill
 
03:07:23.870 --> 03:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
is written it only covers uh digital
 
03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
asset mining businesses are located in
 
03:07:28.710 --> 03:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
um industrial residential zones so
 
03:07:30.349 --> 03:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
there's different types of zones you
 
03:07:31.950 --> 03:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
know there's commercial zones rural
 
03:07:34.590 --> 03:07:34.600 align:start position:0%
zones um and even the industrial Zone
 
03:07:36.070 --> 03:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
industrial zones are often for a
 
03:07:38.590 --> 03:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
specific type of Industry so it may or
 
03:07:41.469 --> 03:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
may not be a good idea to have somebody
 
03:07:43.950 --> 03:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
running you know a huge honking
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency server generating lots of
 
03:07:48.510 --> 03:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
excess noise and heat using you know
 
03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
placing a burden on the electric supply
 
03:07:52.950 --> 03:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
just to uh you know that shouldn't
 
03:07:55.150 --> 03:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily be allowed in any industrial
 
03:07:56.990 --> 03:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
Zone if the industrial zone is for like
 
03:07:59.110 --> 03:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
some specific type of Industry as most
 
03:08:01.030 --> 03:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
stars so
 
03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
um I think um so I definitely think par
 
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
sub paragraphs 2 and three in propos RSA
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
6471 16a um paragraph one might be okay
 
03:08:13.269 --> 03:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
but it needs some exceptions and I'm
 
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
standing between you and my lunch and um
 
03:08:18.550 --> 03:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
so I would say just the best thing to do
 
03:08:20.110 --> 03:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
it's interesting bill but I think you
 
03:08:20.830 --> 03:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
should probably just find your
 
03:08:22.429 --> 03:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and I'm sure
 
03:08:25.590 --> 03:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
this issue will come up again so thanks
 
03:08:27.269 --> 03:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much hopefully hopefully
 
03:08:28.830 --> 03:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
nobody has any questions so you're free
 
03:08:32.550 --> 03:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
to fre to thanks closing the public
 
03:08:34.389 --> 03:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
hearing yes did a very good job of
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:42.000 --> 04:27:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:33.229 --> 04:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll just get started here
 
04:27:35.229 --> 04:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
because I guess Tony kaplan's not here
 
04:27:38.229 --> 04:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
right oh he is here when you just sneak
 
04:27:38.239 --> 04:27:39.149 align:start position:0%
right oh he is here when you just sneak
in

04:27:39.149 --> 04:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:27:49.710 --> 04:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:51.910 --> 04:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead
 
04:27:54.510 --> 04:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
yep thank you uh chairman hunt and
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
thanks members of the Commerce Committee
 
04:27:59.550 --> 04:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Tony Kaplan
 
04:28:02.149 --> 04:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to represent the towns of
 
04:28:05.109 --> 04:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
Haner Bradford and Warner and present
 
04:28:09.469 --> 04:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
hb12 127 an act relative to single use
 
04:28:12.830 --> 04:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
disposable plastic food wear
 
04:28:15.630 --> 04:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
accessories this bill is intended to be
 
04:28:17.349 --> 04:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
a win-win piece of legislation for
 
04:28:20.030 --> 04:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
Granite State communities businesses and
 
04:28:21.630 --> 04:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
the environment we rely on for our
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
sustenance and
 
04:28:25.590 --> 04:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
survival this bill contrary to public
 
04:28:28.550 --> 04:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
opinion does not mandate or prohibit the
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
use of single-use plastic food wear
 
04:28:32.710 --> 04:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
accessories instead it seeks to limit
 
04:28:35.590 --> 04:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
the use of these items except on demand
 
04:28:37.590 --> 04:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
in restaurants large and small across

04:28:47.830 --> 04:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions Plastics make up about 15%
 
04:28:49.710 --> 04:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
of our country's Municipal Solid Waste
 
04:28:52.510 --> 04:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
generation this is due to the increased
 
04:28:55.189 --> 04:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of plastics and plastic
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
non-existent approximately only 9% of
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
plastic ever produced has been recycled
 
04:29:08.910 --> 04:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
plastic pollution is estimated to be
 
04:29:11.910 --> 04:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
around 79% of the total waste generated
 
04:29:14.870 --> 04:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
around the entire planet and Plastics
 
04:29:17.710 --> 04:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
account for 3.4% of global greenhouse
 
04:29:20.550 --> 04:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
gas emissions majority of ocean plastic
 
04:29:22.910 --> 04:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
around 80% comes from landbased sources
 
04:29:25.429 --> 04:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
namely the garbage that we produce we've
 
04:29:27.950 --> 04:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
all seen the images of those patches in
 
04:29:29.710 --> 04:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
the ocean full of garbage floating
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
garbage so-called dead zones uh dead and
 
04:29:35.830 --> 04:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
dying as a result of our unsustainable
 
04:29:38.510 --> 04:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
use of plastic and the plastic
 
04:29:40.670 --> 04:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
pollution these are truly frightening
 
04:29:42.349 --> 04:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
developments that are happening unless
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
you believe that there's somehow fake
 
04:29:45.469 --> 04:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
news or an attempt to
 
04:29:47.790 --> 04:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
Hoodwink the
 
04:29:50.109 --> 04:29:50.119 align:start position:0%
public but the facts are undeniable and
 
04:29:52.710 --> 04:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
the science is clear we're poisoning
 
04:29:55.830 --> 04:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves this should not be a partisan
 
04:29:58.269 --> 04:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
issue and we who have our hands on the
 
04:30:00.550 --> 04:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
levers of power and our
 
04:30:02.750 --> 04:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
state ought to do the right thing for
 
04:30:02.760 --> 04:30:03.950 align:start position:0%
state ought to do the right thing for
our

04:30:03.950 --> 04:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:30:05.950 --> 04:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
constituents as a matter of fact we are
 
04:30:08.189 --> 04:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
doing that in New Hampshire we're
 
04:30:11.469 --> 04:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
attempting to bring down our rates of
 
04:30:13.710 --> 04:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
solid waste because we're experiencing
 
04:30:15.309 --> 04:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
the effect of the pollution on our
 
04:30:18.189 --> 04:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
health and on our
 
04:30:20.429 --> 04:30:20.439 align:start position:0%
communities the state Solid Waste
 
04:30:22.750 --> 04:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
Management plan issued last year calls
 
04:30:24.630 --> 04:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
for a reduction or diversion of solid
 
04:30:29.710 --> 04:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
waste by 25% by 2030 and 45% by 2050
 
04:30:32.389 --> 04:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
from the 2018 Baseline of around 1 a
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
half million tons of solid waste that we
 
04:30:36.309 --> 04:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
send to landfills or in
 
04:30:39.149 --> 04:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
incinerators and inevitably poison our
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
air water and soil in the form of
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
leachates or air
 
04:30:46.830 --> 04:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
emissions many of these poisons are long
 
04:30:48.870 --> 04:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
lived and effectively do not break down
 
04:30:50.750 --> 04:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
in the environment and their poisons
 
04:30:53.910 --> 04:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
accumulate and combine in our soil water
 
04:30:56.030 --> 04:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
food and bodies in ways that we're just
 
04:30:57.590 --> 04:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
beginning to
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
understand this bill is not a Magic
 
04:31:02.550 --> 04:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
Bullet that's going to end the plastic
 
04:31:04.149 --> 04:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
pollution problem but it is a step in
 
04:31:06.429 --> 04:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
the right direction
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
I used to live in New York City and uh I
 
04:31:10.870 --> 04:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
remember at some point the city
 
04:31:13.189 --> 04:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
administrators decided to uh try to
 
04:31:14.910 --> 04:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
fight crime
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
by by uh clamping down on small
 
04:31:19.750 --> 04:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
infractions you know you couldn't spit
 
04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
on the sidewalk anymore and there
 
04:31:24.670 --> 04:31:24.680 align:start position:0%
so-called uh no broken windows theory of
 
04:31:26.670 --> 04:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
policing and and the idea is that if
 
04:31:28.229 --> 04:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
people live in a neighborhood full of
 
04:31:30.109 --> 04:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
broken windows they act like they live
 
04:31:31.950 --> 04:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
in a neighborhood full of broken windows
 
04:31:34.189 --> 04:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
and so if you can prevent the broken
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
windows you get uh people's behavior uh
 
04:31:39.550 --> 04:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
improving and so I look at this bill as
 
04:31:41.389 --> 04:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
kind of like the no broken windows
 
04:31:43.229 --> 04:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
policy of plastic pollution it's not
 
04:31:45.109 --> 04:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
going to solve the problem but it's
 
04:31:47.950 --> 04:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
going to raise our expectations and U
 
04:31:50.189 --> 04:31:50.199 align:start position:0%
it's something we ought to
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
do and imposes no costs on food
 
04:31:55.830 --> 04:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
businesses but instead results in a
 
04:31:57.830 --> 04:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
direct savings as restaurants no longer
 
04:32:00.189 --> 04:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
need to stock as many reserves of these
 
04:32:02.510 --> 04:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
single-use Plastics we're talking about
 
04:32:04.870 --> 04:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
straws we're talking about cup lids
 
04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the little stirs
 
04:32:08.469 --> 04:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
that you that you get you know when on
 
04:32:10.590 --> 04:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
your tray you're going through the line
 
04:32:12.389 --> 04:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
and it ends up in the garbage it's not a
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
huge amount of uh of waste when you're
 
04:32:16.750 --> 04:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
talking about the the total bulk or the
 
04:32:18.389 --> 04:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
total volume of waste that we produce
 
04:32:20.750 --> 04:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
but it's you know it's significant if
 
04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
you go town by
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
Town it imposes no burdens on customers
 
04:32:27.469 --> 04:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
they can simply request these items if
 
04:32:30.189 --> 04:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
they feel they need to have them and it
 
04:32:32.349 --> 04:32:32.359 align:start position:0%
results in a reduction of solid waste in
 
04:32:34.469 --> 04:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
line with the state's official Solid
 
04:32:36.630 --> 04:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
Waste Management plan
 
04:32:38.670 --> 04:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
and more importantly it begin as I said
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
to turn the tide on the mountains of
 
04:32:40.319 --> 04:32:41.469 align:start position:0%
to turn the tide on the mountains of
plastic

04:32:41.469 --> 04:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
plastic
 
04:32:43.750 --> 04:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
garbage I hope you support this bill and
 
04:32:45.149 --> 04:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
send a message that the New Hampshire
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
State House supports our official policy
 
04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
on waste reduction and diversion and
 
04:32:52.109 --> 04:32:52.119 align:start position:0%
supports Public Health outcomes implicit
 
04:32:57.109 --> 04:32:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:00.630 --> 04:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
you I'll take any qu represent GI has a
 
04:33:02.510 --> 04:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
question take any
 
04:33:02.520 --> 04:33:04.189 align:start position:0%
question take any
questions

04:33:04.189 --> 04:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:33:07.109 --> 04:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank thank you Mr
 
04:33:10.109 --> 04:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
chairman I want to say in general I
 
04:33:13.390 --> 04:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
support the ideas of this spill but my
 
04:33:18.230 --> 04:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
question is if you have to ask for a
 
04:33:20.789 --> 04:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
spoon every time you buy a bowl of soup
 
04:33:24.390 --> 04:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
in say Panera Bread or a stir every time
 
04:33:27.670 --> 04:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
you buy a cup of coffee isn't that going
 
04:33:31.990 --> 04:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
to slow down service and impose some
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
considerable costs on uh the the seller
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
the the um facility and also um uh
 
04:33:43.830 --> 04:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
inconvenience on the
 
04:33:46.029 --> 04:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
customer yeah that's a good question uh
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh and I don't have a
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
figure on you know the time spent in
 
04:33:52.189 --> 04:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
line when you're asking for spoons and
 
04:33:53.789 --> 04:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
stirs and stuff like that so I don't
 
04:33:56.230 --> 04:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
really know if that's a fact or not I
 
04:33:57.910 --> 04:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know intuitively it makes sense but
 
04:33:59.551 --> 04:33:59.561 align:start position:0%
then on the other hand really how much
 
04:34:01.750 --> 04:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
time people spend handing over a spoon
 
04:34:03.029 --> 04:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
you know across the counter is that
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
really going to affect the line I mean
 
04:34:06.670 --> 04:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
it have to be pretty huge line to
 
04:34:09.189 --> 04:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
actually have an impact but then again
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
you know you might have a point but I
 
04:34:12.750 --> 04:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer to that so you
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
know it's a matter of conjecture and
 
04:34:17.590 --> 04:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
it's something valid to think about for
 
04:34:19.830 --> 04:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
sure well in terms of the question she's
 
04:34:23.189 --> 04:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
saying if you're if you're ordering
 
04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
soup I guess you could pick up the bowl
 
04:34:28.150 --> 04:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
and drink it this way but you do need a
 
04:34:29.910 --> 04:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
spoon yeah you should be given a spoon
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't have to ask you whether
 
04:34:32.629 --> 04:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
you need
 
04:34:36.189 --> 04:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
one why not that's what the bill the
 
04:34:38.269 --> 04:34:38.279 align:start position:0%
bill says you have to add I mean you
 
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
you're asking for the soup so why not
 
04:34:42.269 --> 04:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
say I need a soup spoon while you're at
 
04:34:45.150 --> 04:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
it and I mean it's it's a simple change
 
04:34:47.789 --> 04:34:47.799 align:start position:0%
in habit as far as I see you know it's
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
it's a different expectation of what you
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
have yeah I guess I was correct because
 
04:34:52.629 --> 04:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
I I guess I haven't been to Panera Bread
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
in a while but evidently they provide
 
04:34:57.629 --> 04:34:57.639 align:start position:0%
silverware they do provide silverware so
 
04:35:00.150 --> 04:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's not a good example so here's my
 
04:35:02.789 --> 04:35:02.799 align:start position:0%
example okay because you said is that uh
 
04:35:05.349 --> 04:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
let's let's try to reduce it by not
 
04:35:06.910 --> 04:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
having so much
 
04:35:10.709 --> 04:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
available and um I was marveled uh and
 
04:35:12.869 --> 04:35:12.879 align:start position:0%
I've only noticed this now know a couple
 
04:35:15.629 --> 04:35:15.639 align:start position:0%
months ago when I was walking out of my
 
04:35:18.830 --> 04:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
hords they have a this
 
04:35:23.670 --> 04:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
display and the display has the plastic
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
silverware it has the forks the Spy the
 
04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
Nunes and it's now so oh okay so like
 
04:35:30.869 --> 04:35:30.879 align:start position:0%
these are things that you're trying to
 
04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
avoid is that their idea that I was I
 
04:35:34.910 --> 04:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
know they were saying is yeah so when
 
04:35:37.910 --> 04:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
some someone goes to the salad bar or
 
04:35:41.429 --> 04:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
somebody whatever they bought maybe and
 
04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
instead of asking instead of having the
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
inventory at at every cash
 
04:35:49.750 --> 04:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
register they have one stand as you
 
04:35:49.760 --> 04:35:51.109 align:start position:0%
register they have one stand as you
walking

04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
walking
 
04:35:55.230 --> 04:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
out that provides those civilwar M or
 
04:35:56.629 --> 04:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
plastic wear excuse
 
04:35:59.750 --> 04:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
me that seems like a very efficient
 
04:36:02.109 --> 04:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
effective that's customer asking for it
 
04:36:03.869 --> 04:36:03.879 align:start position:0%
you know but doesn't have to ask an
 
04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
employee doesn't have to work about
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
anybody but if I read this bill you're
 
04:36:10.470 --> 04:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
saying they can't do that you got that
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
Ma out only dealing with food it's not
 
04:36:13.789 --> 04:36:13.799 align:start position:0%
it's not dealing with Supermarket so
 
04:36:16.189 --> 04:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
it's not not it's really a retail food
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
store yeah I mean doesn't count as a
 
04:36:21.230 --> 04:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
retail food store it's a supermarket I
 
04:36:22.709 --> 04:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know I mean does Hanford a
 
04:36:24.869 --> 04:36:24.879 align:start position:0%
retail food store I don't think it it is
 
04:36:27.349 --> 04:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
according to the definition yeah they're
 
04:36:29.230 --> 04:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I me they have a salad bar that's
 
04:36:30.470 --> 04:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
why we would need a
 
04:36:33.789 --> 04:36:33.799 align:start position:0%
fork so so I'm just saying that it well
 
04:36:36.230 --> 04:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
in in that case I think think having it
 
04:36:40.349 --> 04:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
available at one place might be the same
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
thing as asking for it I mean you know
 
04:36:44.910 --> 04:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
that's matter of interpretation minut it
 
04:36:46.109 --> 04:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
and then the only other one I want to
 
04:36:49.070 --> 04:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
tell you the irony of this bill is that
 
04:36:50.709 --> 04:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
we've had legislation in this committee
 
04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
before about um Sal guys with the carts
 
04:36:55.230 --> 04:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
hot dog
 
04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
carts and Health and Human Services
 
04:37:02.109 --> 04:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
insists that they cannot use a little
 
04:37:04.510 --> 04:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
bottle of ketchup or mustard that they
 
04:37:07.029 --> 04:37:07.039 align:start position:0%
have to have those little plastic bags
 
04:37:11.189 --> 04:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
the plastic single Ser packets we
 
04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
require that by law so here we are we
 
04:37:16.429 --> 04:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
required a law and now we're going to
 
04:37:18.789 --> 04:37:18.799 align:start position:0%
make the person have to beg for
 
04:37:21.150 --> 04:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
it well I mean you know representative
 
04:37:23.629 --> 04:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
times change we've we've we at the time
 
04:37:25.750 --> 04:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
that that that the department of human
 
04:37:27.629 --> 04:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
health health and human services was
 
04:37:29.590 --> 04:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
requiring people to change from the you
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
know the plastic the the bottle
 
04:37:33.150 --> 04:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
dispensers to those condiment packets
 
04:37:35.590 --> 04:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
maybe that made sense what we're seeing
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
now is that it doesn't quite make sense
 
04:37:39.750 --> 04:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
but we're they're not going to change
 
04:37:39.760 --> 04:37:41.310 align:start position:0%
but we're they're not going to change
the

04:37:41.310 --> 04:37:41.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
rule no they won't we know we went
 
04:37:44.869 --> 04:37:44.879 align:start position:0%
through that battle well I mean that
 
04:37:46.189 --> 04:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
that's outside the scope of this
 
04:37:47.750 --> 04:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
discussion we're not going to debate
 
04:37:49.709 --> 04:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
other statutes we're debating know
 
04:37:51.551 --> 04:37:51.561 align:start position:0%
besides we shouldn't even be dating this
 
04:37:53.789 --> 04:37:53.799 align:start position:0%
okay but anyway represent bur would you
 
04:37:56.949 --> 04:37:56.959 align:start position:0%
believe that a lot of not a lot some
 
04:37:59.349 --> 04:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
Outlets like Hannafords and whatnot will
 
04:38:01.390 --> 04:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
give you a spoon at checkout and one of
 
04:38:03.670 --> 04:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
the reasons they do it is because some
 
04:38:05.910 --> 04:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
people like to NAB all the silverware
 
04:38:08.750 --> 04:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
the the plastic stuff and take it home
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
so I mean that's it actually benefits
 
04:38:12.670 --> 04:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
the supermarket if they don't have
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
people taking 20 packets of of uh of
 
04:38:17.789 --> 04:38:17.799 align:start position:0%
things they don't they don't need at
 
04:38:19.510 --> 04:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
that moment I totally believe that and a
 
04:38:21.150 --> 04:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
way it's a way of saving them costs
 
04:38:23.070 --> 04:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
right I they're not getting their their
 
04:38:24.429 --> 04:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
things stolen they don't have to stock
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
it every I mean that's kind of the
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is to save the
 
04:38:33.750 --> 04:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
question um
 
04:38:40.269 --> 04:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
there are um places like um the
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
conquered Co-op that really is doing a
 
04:38:44.230 --> 04:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
pretty good job with you know what
 
04:38:48.109 --> 04:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
they're using and uh my my question was
 
04:38:49.990 --> 04:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
um have you spoken with any of the
 
04:38:53.189 --> 04:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
grocery stores uh Hanford that's a big
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
one in the state kind of try to have a
 
04:38:59.230 --> 04:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
conversation with them regarding their
 
04:39:01.709 --> 04:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
policies I I have not representative I
 
04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
have not had a discussion with
 
04:39:03.840 --> 04:39:05.750 align:start position:0%
have not had a discussion with
supermarkets

04:39:05.750 --> 04:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
supermarkets
 
04:39:08.750 --> 04:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
okay represent go thank you Mr chairman
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
04:39:13.429 --> 04:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
question um you mentioned that the
 
04:39:15.230 --> 04:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
restaurants and food service
 
04:39:16.869 --> 04:39:16.879 align:start position:0%
establishments are highly motivated to
 
04:39:18.910 --> 04:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
do this anyways because it's one of the
 
04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
intents of the bill to save them some
 
04:39:22.750 --> 04:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
money so is there anything in statute
 
04:39:24.551 --> 04:39:24.561 align:start position:0%
other than what representative hunt
 
04:39:26.629 --> 04:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh that prohibits them from
 
04:39:29.230 --> 04:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
already doing exactly what's in this
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
bill that's a good question I am not
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
sure if there is any prohibition on
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
doing something like this I but I
 
04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
haven't heard heard of that so I would
 
04:39:36.320 --> 04:39:38.270 align:start position:0%
haven't heard heard of that so I would
doubt

04:39:38.270 --> 04:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
doubt
 
04:39:43.110 --> 04:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you very much thank you
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
okay do I
 
04:39:48.910 --> 04:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:52.030 --> 04:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
here right so this here
 
04:39:56.310 --> 04:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
okay um so
 
04:40:00.708 --> 04:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh I have I guess three people in a post
 
04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay Ben Bradley New Hampshire Hospital
 
04:40:03.760 --> 04:40:07.150 align:start position:0%
okay Ben Bradley New Hampshire Hospital
Association

04:40:07.150 --> 04:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:11.150 --> 04:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
okay so uh he he told me that we in past
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
years when we had this bill we actually
 
04:40:17.590 --> 04:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
um Exempted the hospital Association uh
 
04:40:19.510 --> 04:40:19.520 align:start position:0%

Association thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:40:29.868 --> 04:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Henry veu and I'm here on
 
04:40:34.190 --> 04:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire lodging and
 
04:40:34.200 --> 04:40:35.310 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire lodging and
restaurant

04:40:35.310 --> 04:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
04:40:37.550 --> 04:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
Association um we had our government
 
04:40:40.150 --> 04:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
Affairs call with uh the restaurant
 
04:40:41.670 --> 04:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
folks on Monday and went over number of
 
04:40:44.030 --> 04:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
bills this was one of them um and the
 
04:40:48.390 --> 04:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
reaction we got from folks um was one um
 
04:40:51.948 --> 04:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
the uh cost of the Alternatives uh to
 
04:40:56.070 --> 04:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
plastic wear are more expensive uh so
 
04:40:58.390 --> 04:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
there was a cost factor in terms of what
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
the alternatives to the the plastic
 
04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
spoons and forks um the issue of
 
04:41:03.840 --> 04:41:05.390 align:start position:0%
spoons and forks um the issue of
Sanitation

04:41:05.390 --> 04:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
Sanitation
 
04:41:07.750 --> 04:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
um the plastic spoons and forks
 
04:41:09.948 --> 04:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
evidently they're more sanitary than
 
04:41:11.350 --> 04:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
some of the other
 
04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
Alternatives um and then uh the last uh
 
04:41:18.788 --> 04:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
thought and reaction from folks was
 
04:41:23.750 --> 04:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
while this uh may be good in theory um
 
04:41:26.550 --> 04:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
if you've ever worked in a restaurant on
 
04:41:29.788 --> 04:41:29.798 align:start position:0%
a very busy night with so many things
 
04:41:32.470 --> 04:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
that could go wrong and sometimes do go
 
04:41:35.390 --> 04:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
wrong if you're adding the additional
 
04:41:37.910 --> 04:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
factor in there for for instance someone
 
04:41:40.190 --> 04:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
that wants a takeout order and you
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
forget to ask them whether they want the
 
04:41:44.788 --> 04:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
spoon or fork and you just put it in
 
04:41:48.190 --> 04:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
there anyways it'd be violating the law
 
04:41:50.470 --> 04:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
um if you don't put it in and the
 
04:41:52.350 --> 04:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
customer UPS it's just a no-win
 
04:41:55.510 --> 04:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
situation so just the Practical
 
04:41:58.590 --> 04:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
implications of all this stuff in theory
 
04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it makes sense but again
 
04:42:03.390 --> 04:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
if you've ever worked at a restaurant on
 
04:42:06.270 --> 04:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
a very busy night um the practical
 
04:42:07.670 --> 04:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
application of this stuff becomes a
 
04:42:10.470 --> 04:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
little more difficult um and that's
 
04:42:10.480 --> 04:42:12.030 align:start position:0%
little more difficult um and that's
largely

04:42:12.030 --> 04:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
largely
 
04:42:16.430 --> 04:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
it okay yeah
 
04:42:20.350 --> 04:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thank you for take my question
 
04:42:23.550 --> 04:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
um in a restaurant if you're ordering a
 
04:42:26.550 --> 04:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
takeout often times you're going back to
 
04:42:28.230 --> 04:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
your house or back to the office where
 
04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
they have civilware it's very similar to
 
04:42:33.070 --> 04:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
you know please don't give me a bag
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
that's what I say I don't need a bag
 
04:42:40.150 --> 04:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
there's only one so so I think if maybe
 
04:42:42.550 --> 04:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
um the restaurants can ask do you need
 
04:42:45.230 --> 04:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
you know utensils that only takes a
 
04:42:47.430 --> 04:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
second so that might be something that
 
04:42:49.948 --> 04:42:49.958 align:start position:0%
we can and I'm sure some of them do uh
 
04:42:52.830 --> 04:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
to the idea of reducing you know their
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
costs um I I think just putting in
 
04:42:58.670 --> 04:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
statute and having ramifications for not
 
04:43:00.948 --> 04:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
doing it by law is a little bit
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
different so it's basically education
 
04:43:03.480 --> 04:43:05.948 align:start position:0%
different so it's basically education
yeah

04:43:05.948 --> 04:43:05.958 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:43:09.430 --> 04:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
any questions see none thank you uh Ben
 
04:43:26.190 --> 04:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:29.430 --> 04:43:29.440 align:start position:0%

um I understand maybe you spoke a moment
 
04:43:51.270 --> 04:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
ago about a previous exemption for this
 
04:43:54.708 --> 04:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
um Bill I'm happy to share my testimony
 
04:43:56.830 --> 04:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
but um hospitals have scenarios where we
 
04:43:58.430 --> 04:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
feel it's appropriate to ensure for
 
04:44:02.070 --> 04:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
patient care um the use of some of these
 
04:44:04.030 --> 04:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
products um and would ask for that
 
04:44:04.040 --> 04:44:07.030 align:start position:0%
products um and would ask for that
exemption

04:44:07.030 --> 04:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:10.750 --> 04:44:10.760 align:start position:0%

04:44:19.390 --> 04:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
have to have plastic sure so um for
 
04:44:21.390 --> 04:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
example what's been used in the past as
 
04:44:25.750 --> 04:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
an example is um a paper straw um and
 
04:44:27.910 --> 04:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
the ability to flex the straw so a
 
04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:33.360 --> 04:44:36.310 align:start position:0%

administrator for the New Hampshire
 
04:45:30.550 --> 04:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections um we're
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh HB 1207 in its current
 
04:45:35.830 --> 04:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
form and respectfully request an
 
04:45:39.230 --> 04:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
exemption as well um there are
 
04:45:41.190 --> 04:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
complexities of food service provision
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
within a correctional environment that
 
04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
we think this bill would have some
 
04:45:48.390 --> 04:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences on we understand
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
and appreciate the importance of
 
04:45:52.788 --> 04:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
reducing our environmental impact and
 
04:45:52.798 --> 04:45:54.030 align:start position:0%
reducing our environmental impact and
promoting

04:45:54.030 --> 04:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
promoting
 
04:45:57.670 --> 04:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
sustainability um however this bill will
 
04:45:59.510 --> 04:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
adversely impact the safety and
 
04:46:02.070 --> 04:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
efficiency of our food services in
 
04:46:03.788 --> 04:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities and in our
 
04:46:06.430 --> 04:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
security psychiatric unit um Safety and
 
04:46:08.670 --> 04:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
Security are vital our general
 
04:46:10.830 --> 04:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
population units for the most part are
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
able to utilize um
 
04:46:17.628 --> 04:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
reusable um silverware and Trays however
 
04:46:19.670 --> 04:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
in some of our higher security units and
 
04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
in our secureity psychiatric units
 
04:46:25.150 --> 04:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
they're using um the single use trays
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
and utensils much more
 
04:46:29.350 --> 04:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
frequently um the plastic utensils trays
 
04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
and containers although they're
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
disposable are designed to minimize some
 
04:46:37.548 --> 04:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
risk um and this piece of legislation um
 
04:46:39.590 --> 04:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
inadvertently compromises the safety
 
04:46:42.548 --> 04:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
protocols within our facility um we also
 
04:46:45.590 --> 04:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
realized during the pandemic um that we
 
04:46:47.670 --> 04:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
needed to we have obviously have a
 
04:46:50.750 --> 04:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
congregate living setting um in
 
04:46:53.230 --> 04:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
maintaining that hygiene is critical um
 
04:46:55.030 --> 04:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
we have resident workers that work in
 
04:46:56.390 --> 04:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
our kitchens and we also have like
 
04:46:58.628 --> 04:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
regular staff that work in our kitchens
 
04:47:00.670 --> 04:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
um and if we ban um single use
 
04:47:03.150 --> 04:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
disposable food wear during when we have
 
04:47:04.910 --> 04:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
a time like an emergency like that we
 
04:47:07.150 --> 04:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
would not be able to manage that
 
04:47:10.708 --> 04:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
situation without the use of some um
 
04:47:13.030 --> 04:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
single use foodware so and thank you
 
04:47:15.230 --> 04:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
very much I'm happy to answer questions
 
04:47:18.430 --> 04:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
so where where in terms of the build you
 
04:47:21.430 --> 04:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
read that that uh you were banned from
 
04:47:23.110 --> 04:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
using them allog
 
04:47:25.868 --> 04:47:25.878 align:start position:0%
together uh we would be we're not
 
04:47:28.750 --> 04:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
allowed we would have to ask people if
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted utensils and that's not
 
04:47:33.830 --> 04:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
always I got you we don't we don't ask
 
04:47:35.628 --> 04:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
PR just
 
04:47:37.990 --> 04:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
well but the problem is is that some
 
04:47:39.948 --> 04:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
people we wouldn't have an alternative
 
04:47:41.788 --> 04:47:41.798 align:start position:0%
for some people have to use those
 
04:47:45.070 --> 04:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
utensils so we can ask them if they want
 
04:47:46.628 --> 04:47:46.638 align:start position:0%
a utensil but I don't have an
 
04:47:48.350 --> 04:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
alternative to give them if they don't
 
04:47:50.590 --> 04:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
got it okay but we do have a question
 
04:47:52.670 --> 04:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
representa own yes thank you Mr chair
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question yes
 
04:47:55.830 --> 04:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
sir I understand you represent the
 
04:47:58.868 --> 04:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
corrections uh uh
 
04:48:01.470 --> 04:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
industry well the state I work for the
 
04:48:03.070 --> 04:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Correction so not the
 
04:48:04.548 --> 04:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
counties but
 
04:48:05.830 --> 04:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
I I guess I misspoke when I said
 
04:48:08.510 --> 04:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
industry uh can you think of any other
 
04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
departments or industries that might may
 
04:48:13.310 --> 04:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
require an exemption um I don't want to
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
speak for others but I you know Health
 
04:48:17.788 --> 04:48:17.798 align:start position:0%
and Human Services obviously runs a runs
 
04:48:19.708 --> 04:48:19.718 align:start position:0%
a hospital as well so I would think that
 
04:48:21.948 --> 04:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
they would yeah
 
04:48:24.190 --> 04:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps okay have
 
04:48:24.200 --> 04:48:25.750 align:start position:0%
perhaps okay have
a

04:48:25.750 --> 04:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:48:28.030 --> 04:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
yes a question about the single use
 
04:48:31.070 --> 04:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
trays why would you need to use those
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
and not plastic
 
04:48:36.990 --> 04:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
trays um go so sometimes in certain
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
settings like our secure psychiatric
 
04:48:41.190 --> 04:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
unit um we may have to use them with
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
some of our patients there because the
 
04:48:45.548 --> 04:48:45.558 align:start position:0%
hard plastic tray could be used as a
 
04:48:49.270 --> 04:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
weapon yep unfortunately and with and
 
04:48:50.868 --> 04:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
then with the silverware can also be
 
04:48:53.430 --> 04:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
used for self harm
 
04:48:56.310 --> 04:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately great thank you thank
 
04:48:58.670 --> 04:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
you okay so the remaining cards are in
 
04:49:02.708 --> 04:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
support um so I hope you'll not belabor
 
04:49:04.230 --> 04:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
too much because I think we pretty
 
04:49:21.868 --> 04:49:21.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:25.190 --> 04:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
Walter hello thank you for taking my
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
testimony um I'm glad to be here I'm
 
04:49:32.470 --> 04:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
glad to be one of the first persons um
 
04:49:36.868 --> 04:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
so here's how I see this bill um I've
 
04:49:40.190 --> 04:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
been a waitress and I've worked in
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals and I've also taught about um
 
04:49:46.110 --> 04:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
plastic pollution and and other forms of
 
04:49:48.990 --> 04:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
pollution as well I'm also a taxpayer
 
04:49:54.070 --> 04:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
who's very tired of the severe increases
 
04:49:57.868 --> 04:49:57.878 align:start position:0%
in solid waste that I need to pay for
 
04:50:00.948 --> 04:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
from my town budget it's a big deal it's
 
04:50:04.150 --> 04:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
tripled for some towns um for solid
 
04:50:05.788 --> 04:50:05.798 align:start position:0%
waste so here's what happens and here's
 
04:50:08.750 --> 04:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
how I'd like to see this bill um move
 
04:50:12.350 --> 04:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
forward I know I'm speaking to the bill
 
04:50:16.150 --> 04:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
as it's written but I see in this
 
04:50:20.670 --> 04:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
bill parts of what I'm about to cover
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
and I have a a one pager that'll take a
 
04:50:24.190 --> 04:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
few seconds for you to read and I'll
 
04:50:26.670 --> 04:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
pass it out in a minute but here's what
 
04:50:29.230 --> 04:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
happens to me as a person who orders
 
04:50:32.430 --> 04:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
takeout there's no mechanism in most
 
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
takeout systems whether it's on the
 
04:50:37.990 --> 04:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
phone or on the computer for me to say
 
04:50:40.430 --> 04:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
that I don't want this stuff it's
 
04:50:42.910 --> 04:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
takeout I'm taking it to my home in most
 
04:50:45.830 --> 04:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
cases where I have what I
 
04:50:49.270 --> 04:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
need and so I get this stuff I get a
 
04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful food in here and I can throw
 
04:50:53.788 --> 04:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
away this I can recycle this bag but I
 
04:50:59.230 --> 04:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
get this junk now I have to pay my city
 
04:51:00.590 --> 04:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
to throw this
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
away it's a waste of my time it cost
 
04:51:06.590 --> 04:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
cost the the retail the the restaurant
 
04:51:08.470 --> 04:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
money and time to put this in it costs
 
04:51:10.670 --> 04:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
them money and time for them to order
 
04:51:13.510 --> 04:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
and stockpile all this stuff in their
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant I've talked to restaurant
 
04:51:17.788 --> 04:51:17.798 align:start position:0%
people they don't like piling this stuff
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
together they don't like dumping it in
 
04:51:21.270 --> 04:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
here finding room for it among all the
 
04:51:24.390 --> 04:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
foods and so on if it's needed for the
 
04:51:27.270 --> 04:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
stew or the soup then they they put
 
04:51:29.110 --> 04:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
right next they can put right next to it
 
04:51:31.070 --> 04:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
one there now you say well why do they
 
04:51:32.830 --> 04:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
why don't these retailers and restaurant
 
04:51:35.190 --> 04:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
owners just do this is why don't we just
 
04:51:37.310 --> 04:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
let it be optional here's the problem
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
with that when it's
 
04:51:42.628 --> 04:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
confusing to the customer like myself
 
04:51:45.030 --> 04:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
some ask you some don't ask you some
 
04:51:46.788 --> 04:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
will give it automatically some don't
 
04:51:49.868 --> 04:51:49.878 align:start position:0%
give it when it's all a mix then it's
 
04:51:51.910 --> 04:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
too confusing for us and they just dump
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
it on you anyway so we customers and we
 
04:52:00.830 --> 04:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers get to have to work with this
 
04:52:05.030 --> 04:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
and I think slimming this bill to a take
 
04:52:09.990 --> 04:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
out by order by request materials will
 
04:52:13.190 --> 04:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
save a lot of the problem and not have
 
04:52:14.750 --> 04:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
to work with that
 
04:52:17.910 --> 04:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
problem and so I would I know we're
 
04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to speak just to the bill the
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
way it's written but I I do want to say
 
04:52:24.270 --> 04:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
that those aspects of the way the bill
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
is written do allow for understanding
 
04:52:32.470 --> 04:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
this as a benefit for take out and take
 
04:52:34.190 --> 04:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
out receivers for take restaurant take
 
04:52:35.788 --> 04:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
out restaurants and take out receivers
 
04:52:37.628 --> 04:52:37.638 align:start position:0%
like myself thank
 
04:52:37.638 --> 04:52:39.190 align:start position:0%
like myself thank
you

04:52:39.190 --> 04:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:52:41.708 --> 04:52:41.718 align:start position:0%
so I don't know about you but whenever I
 
04:52:44.190 --> 04:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
do takeout I always open the bag before
 
04:52:46.190 --> 04:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
I walk out to make sure I got what I
 
04:52:48.868 --> 04:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
wanted and if they did stick the plastic
 
04:52:50.390 --> 04:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
silver in there why aren't you just
 
04:52:51.948 --> 04:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
pulling it out and giving it back to
 
04:52:56.510 --> 04:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
them often it's stapled to the receipt
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
often I don't have time um a a
 
04:53:03.070 --> 04:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
grandchild who's picking it up for me
 
04:53:05.670 --> 04:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
they won't do that they're kids you know
 
04:53:07.270 --> 04:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
so I mean you you can't expect the
 
04:53:09.350 --> 04:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
customer to know to do this and know to
 
04:53:11.390 --> 04:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
do that all the time in the restaurants
 
04:53:13.310 --> 04:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
to know to do this and know to do that
 
04:53:14.390 --> 04:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
if it's
 
04:53:17.230 --> 04:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
automatic then it helps everybody move
 
04:53:20.270 --> 04:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
forward and have less waste and remember
 
04:53:25.430 --> 04:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
that waste is a big burden on our towns
 
04:53:25.440 --> 04:53:26.150 align:start position:0%
that waste is a big burden on our towns
thank

04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:53:29.548 --> 04:53:29.558 align:start position:0%
you okay repres Amman has a question
 
04:53:31.270 --> 04:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:53:34.628 --> 04:53:34.638 align:start position:0%
answering our questions um help me
 
04:53:36.750 --> 04:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
understand the penalty for an
 
04:53:39.548 --> 04:53:39.558 align:start position:0%
establishment not complying with this
 
04:53:41.070 --> 04:53:41.080 align:start position:0%
law what what happens if they're a
 
04:53:43.708 --> 04:53:43.718 align:start position:0%
repeat offender and they keep they keep
 
04:53:45.390 --> 04:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
putting the silverware the plasticware
 
04:53:50.350 --> 04:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
$100 a day well I again I I have I
 
04:53:52.708 --> 04:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
don't I didn't write the bill and I
 
04:53:55.750 --> 04:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to uh uh um you know
 
04:53:59.150 --> 04:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
consider that that aspect of the bill so
 
04:54:02.230 --> 04:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
I couldn't say anything about that I'm
 
04:54:04.110 --> 04:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a C I'm just a customer and a
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:10.190 --> 04:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
tour representative
 
04:54:12.590 --> 04:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
Bros I'm I just wonder if you've
 
04:54:14.310 --> 04:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
explored it I mean might it just be
 
04:54:16.910 --> 04:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
easiest I mean a lot of us now order
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
online on our phones or computers um
 
04:54:22.310 --> 04:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
they can add a a
 
04:54:25.350 --> 04:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
um a part of the online order you want
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
utensils or
 
04:54:30.788 --> 04:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
not well yes but again if it's across
 
04:54:30.798 --> 04:54:31.590 align:start position:0%
not well yes but again if it's across
the

04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:34.548 --> 04:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
board a recommendation or requirement to
 
04:54:36.590 --> 04:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
do it across the board on takeout orders
 
04:54:39.110 --> 04:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's Again by phone or by by by
 
04:54:42.990 --> 04:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
online then it's a question
 
04:54:45.868 --> 04:54:45.878 align:start position:0%
of competition here's the issue for
 
04:54:47.990 --> 04:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
competition if one restaurant does it
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
and another restaurant doesn't do it
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
that I'm not comparing the co the the
 
04:54:54.070 --> 04:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
restaurants based on the quality of
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
their food the quality of their service
 
04:55:00.310 --> 04:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
I'm confused by this website and that
 
04:55:03.548 --> 04:55:03.558 align:start position:0%
website and this yes and no and this bud
 
04:55:05.590 --> 04:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
this box and that box you see what I
 
04:55:08.548 --> 04:55:08.558 align:start position:0%
mean we want the best competition to
 
04:55:11.548 --> 04:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
happen for our restaurants and the best
 
04:55:16.110 --> 04:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
competition gives me um a standard to go
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
for um when I get a chance to order take
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
out with or with not without these these
 
04:55:25.470 --> 04:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
additions for the question meire um
 
04:55:27.230 --> 04:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
would you believe there is no standard
 
04:55:29.670 --> 04:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
ordering form online now everyone has a
 
04:55:32.470 --> 04:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
different different one and just to me
 
04:55:35.310 --> 04:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
as a consumer which you believe I'm more
 
04:55:37.628 --> 04:55:37.638 align:start position:0%
like to go I don't go to I mean I
 
04:55:39.510 --> 04:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say I don't go to Panera as
 
04:55:42.070 --> 04:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
much cuz I don't like their packaging so
 
04:55:44.390 --> 04:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't like all the plastic so you
 
04:55:46.310 --> 04:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
know I think it's just a market I mean
 
04:55:48.830 --> 04:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
actually I think it benefits the um the
 
04:55:51.150 --> 04:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
establishments to to ask that and you
 
04:55:53.628 --> 04:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
make the decision
 
04:55:55.788 --> 04:55:55.798 align:start position:0%
yourself right it's just that you you
 
04:55:57.548 --> 04:55:57.558 align:start position:0%
don't always know these things until
 
04:55:59.310 --> 04:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
after they've happened because it could
 
04:56:02.590 --> 04:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
be irregular I love small businesses not
 
04:56:05.110 --> 04:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
not chains so I I want to support the
 
04:56:07.510 --> 04:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
small businesses and I want them to have
 
04:56:10.030 --> 04:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
this guidance and this Level Playing
 
04:56:13.310 --> 04:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
Field so that I can compare one small
 
04:56:14.788 --> 04:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
restaurant versus another small
 
04:56:16.150 --> 04:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
restaurant based on their food and their
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
service and not whether or not they're
 
04:56:21.470 --> 04:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
they're dumping this in you know I just
 
04:56:24.628 --> 04:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
can't keep up with all that you know so
 
04:56:26.670 --> 04:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate your your positions here
 
04:56:27.510 --> 04:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
and I know those are good
 
04:56:30.030 --> 04:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
counterarguments but I think we need to
 
04:56:30.040 --> 04:56:31.030 align:start position:0%
counterarguments but I think we need to
look

04:56:31.030 --> 04:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
look
 
04:56:34.510 --> 04:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
forward represen m thank you Mr chairman
 
04:56:37.470 --> 04:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing the props and for
 
04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
bringing these issues up as someone
 
04:56:41.230 --> 04:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
who's travels a bit for business and
 
04:56:43.708 --> 04:56:43.718 align:start position:0%
I've had more than one occasion where
 
04:56:46.470 --> 04:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
I've had to Fashion a utensil after
 
04:56:48.150 --> 04:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
forgetting to check the box because I
 
04:56:51.150 --> 04:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
too was confused by Uber Eats door Dash
 
04:56:54.628 --> 04:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
GrubHub Eat24 etc etc what I found now
 
04:56:56.990 --> 04:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
is they universally do not include
 
04:56:59.590 --> 04:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
utensils unless you specifically ask for
 
04:57:02.590 --> 04:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
them so would you believe or do you
 
04:57:04.868 --> 04:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
think that it's already within their
 
04:57:08.270 --> 04:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
purview to just not give them to you
 
04:57:09.830 --> 04:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
like without us telling them that's what
 
04:57:12.030 --> 04:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
they have to do some C Works where some
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
restaurants like Panera chooses to do it
 
04:57:16.628 --> 04:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
out out of convenience because it's just
 
04:57:18.910 --> 04:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
rolled into their cost and you're paying
 
04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
for it anyways so do we do we really
 
04:57:23.990 --> 04:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
need this
 
04:57:26.548 --> 04:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
bill to get the result that's already
 
04:57:27.910 --> 04:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
starting to happen actually and they're
 
04:57:30.430 --> 04:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
already motivated to
 
04:57:33.990 --> 04:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
do that's your judgment to to to call
 
04:57:34.000 --> 04:57:35.030 align:start position:0%
do that's your judgment to to to call
thank

04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire Network and uh my
 
04:58:17.788 --> 04:58:17.798 align:start position:0%
comments will be very brief I don't want
 
04:58:19.948 --> 04:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
to be redundant of other people here
 
04:58:22.910 --> 04:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
testifying but um uh to summarize the
 
04:58:26.070 --> 04:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
major points of this bill HB 1207 which
 
04:58:29.590 --> 04:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
would create a skip the stuff policy um
 
04:58:32.510 --> 04:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
a policy like this um is simple it
 
04:58:34.350 --> 04:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
simply means that restaurants and food
 
04:58:36.230 --> 04:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
establishments would not automatically
 
04:58:38.990 --> 04:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
provide single-use Plastics customers
 
04:58:41.590 --> 04:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
that wanted those items uh would simply
 
04:58:44.628 --> 04:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
need to request them and the benefits
 
04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
would be uh to lower consumption of
 
04:58:50.030 --> 04:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
single-use plastics to decrease New
 
04:58:52.708 --> 04:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Solid Waste burden to
 
04:58:54.628 --> 04:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
decrease plastic litter in our
 
04:58:57.548 --> 04:58:57.558 align:start position:0%
communities and to um as has already
 
04:59:00.150 --> 04:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
been described save local New Hampshire
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
restaurants money um I don't have new
 
04:59:04.990 --> 04:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
ampure numbers but nationally it's
 
04:59:07.470 --> 04:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
estimated that restaurants spend around
 
04:59:10.548 --> 04:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
$19 billion annually on disposable food
 
04:59:14.070 --> 04:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
wear um and as has been mentioned
 
04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
previously with uh lower demand
 
04:59:18.750 --> 04:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
restaurants would not need to order and
 
04:59:21.750 --> 04:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
stock as much uh this policy is not a
 
04:59:24.110 --> 04:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
ban it does not seek to get rid of or
 
04:59:26.948 --> 04:59:26.958 align:start position:0%
replace single-use Plastics um and
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
you'll see as it is currently written
 
04:59:30.430 --> 04:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
there already language there that
 
04:59:33.070 --> 04:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
provides for the provision of these
 
04:59:36.390 --> 04:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
disposable items um if there are safety
 
04:59:38.990 --> 04:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
concerns or concerns about spillage of
 
04:59:42.470 --> 04:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
the food um that's it for my testimony
 
04:59:44.750 --> 04:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
before I leave I will hand out two
 
04:59:48.750 --> 04:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
documents one is a fact sheet um about
 
04:59:50.548 --> 04:59:50.558 align:start position:0%
skip the stuff and the other some
 
04:59:52.628 --> 04:59:52.638 align:start position:0%
comments from our local New Hampshire
 
04:59:56.270 --> 04:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
Surf Rider chapter so that's it unless
 
04:59:58.390 --> 04:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
there are any
 
05:00:01.350 --> 05:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
questions I guess we're all
 
05:00:06.230 --> 05:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
set what is Sur wrer uh ocean protection
 
05:00:10.150 --> 05:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
and Beach cleanups oh
 
05:00:15.310 --> 05:00:15.320 align:start position:0%

05:00:25.628 --> 05:00:25.638 align:start position:0%
b middle letter it's a little confusing
 
05:00:25.638 --> 05:00:31.910 align:start position:0%
b middle letter it's a little confusing
for

05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%

babur um from Dover where I am co-chair
 
05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
of the Dover plastic reduction group for
 
05:01:02.110 --> 05:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
the past year we've been working with
 
05:01:06.150 --> 05:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
restaurants and cafes in Dover on an
 
05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
initiative called skip the stuff that is
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
led by Surf Rider Foundation New
 
05:01:17.310 --> 05:01:17.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it essentially engages these
 
05:01:20.470 --> 05:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
businesses restaurants cafes coffee
 
05:01:24.628 --> 05:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
shops to voluntarily Implement what
 
05:01:26.070 --> 05:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
05:01:27.868 --> 05:01:27.878 align:start position:0%
1207 would
 
05:01:31.948 --> 05:01:31.958 align:start position:0%
require accessories such as utensils
 
05:01:36.470 --> 05:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
straws stirrers and condiment packs are
 
05:01:41.190 --> 05:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
provided by request only I expect that
 
05:01:44.708 --> 05:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
each of you have at home some drawer
 
05:01:48.788 --> 05:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
some cabinet some Bag where you have a
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
supply of these items that you neither
 
05:01:59.868 --> 05:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:02.910 --> 05:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
takeout most people end up just
 
05:02:07.788 --> 05:02:07.798 align:start position:0%
discarding them often without even using
 
05:02:07.798 --> 05:02:09.470 align:start position:0%
discarding them often without even using
them

05:02:09.470 --> 05:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:02:13.310 --> 05:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
the initiative that we're involved in
 
05:02:16.910 --> 05:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
and I think the the bill that is under
 
05:02:21.270 --> 05:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
consideration here has
 
05:02:25.548 --> 05:02:25.558 align:start position:0%
signage that lets people know that this
 
05:02:27.910 --> 05:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
is an
 
05:02:27.920 --> 05:02:31.070 align:start position:0%
is an
establishment

05:02:31.070 --> 05:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
that that requires or requests in this
 
05:02:40.510 --> 05:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
case we kindly ask that you request
 
05:02:44.590 --> 05:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
accessories if you need them and the
 
05:02:48.070 --> 05:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
participating restaurants cafes have
 
05:02:51.310 --> 05:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
these signs both in their windows and
 
05:02:54.150 --> 05:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
they also have them in areas where you
 
05:02:59.310 --> 05:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
can pick up the stir the straws whatever
 
05:03:04.190 --> 05:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
you need but the idea is that there not
 
05:03:04.200 --> 05:03:07.670 align:start position:0%
you need but the idea is that there not
automatically

05:03:07.670 --> 05:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:11.470 --> 05:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
included a report by the Overbrook
 
05:03:13.708 --> 05:03:13.718 align:start position:0%
foundation in
 
05:03:16.750 --> 05:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
2020 um called the Dirty Truth About
 
05:03:20.590 --> 05:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
Food Service disposables notes that the
 
05:03:24.070 --> 05:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
most that the useful life of most food
 
05:03:28.788 --> 05:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
service disposables is measured in
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
minutes however these materials
 
05:03:35.270 --> 05:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
particularly the Plastics May last in
 
05:03:40.868 --> 05:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
our landfills for hundreds of years and
 
05:03:44.110 --> 05:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
these the numbers of these items are
 
05:03:48.150 --> 05:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:53.788 --> 05:03:53.798 align:start position:0%
561 billion individual plastic utensils
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
are used by Americans every year and
 
05:04:00.910 --> 05:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
most of these utensils are not
 
05:04:03.830 --> 05:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
recyclable because of their size that
 
05:04:06.788 --> 05:04:06.798 align:start position:0%
lets them slip through
 
05:04:06.798 --> 05:04:08.548 align:start position:0%
lets them slip through
or

05:04:08.548 --> 05:04:08.558 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:04:12.590 --> 05:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
um uh perhaps Jam Machinery that's
 
05:04:15.868 --> 05:04:15.878 align:start position:0%
trying to do the recycling and because
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
they are made of different types of
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
plastics so they're not easily
 
05:04:25.150 --> 05:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
sortable it's also reported that the US
 
05:04:29.708 --> 05:04:29.718 align:start position:0%
discards about 500
 
05:04:34.230 --> 05:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
million straws daily during a five-year
 
05:04:36.948 --> 05:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
research cleanup study
 
05:04:41.430 --> 05:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
7.5 million straws were found on us
 
05:04:41.440 --> 05:04:43.470 align:start position:0%
7.5 million straws were found on us
shorelines

05:04:43.470 --> 05:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
shorelines
 
05:04:46.190 --> 05:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
alone House Bill
 
05:04:50.070 --> 05:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
1207 and we kind of refer to it as the
 
05:04:53.510 --> 05:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
skip the stuff bill because it is so
 
05:04:55.548 --> 05:04:55.558 align:start position:0%
close to the work that we're doing
 
05:04:58.830 --> 05:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
offers a simple opportunity to save
 
05:05:01.350 --> 05:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
restaurants money since they would
 
05:05:05.150 --> 05:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
distribute many fewer unwanted and often
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
unused items by providing these items
 
05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
only by consu customer request we can
 
05:05:16.548 --> 05:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
also reduce the amount of plastic and
 
05:05:20.230 --> 05:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
other unnecessary materials entering our
 
05:05:20.240 --> 05:05:21.230 align:start position:0%
other unnecessary materials entering our
waist

05:05:21.230 --> 05:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
waist
 
05:05:26.548 --> 05:05:26.558 align:start position:0%
stream this bill therefore also responds
 
05:05:27.788 --> 05:05:27.798 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:05:31.230 --> 05:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
2022 New Hampshire Solid Waste
 
05:05:35.310 --> 05:05:35.320 align:start position:0%
Management plans goal number one which
 
05:05:40.030 --> 05:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
is reducing Solid Waste through Source
 
05:05:43.470 --> 05:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
reduction some might ask and I I sort of
 
05:05:45.708 --> 05:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
got this idea from some of the comments
 
05:05:48.910 --> 05:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
that you made so if if some restaurants
 
05:05:51.830 --> 05:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
and cafes are doing this
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
voluntarily why do we need this
 
05:05:58.510 --> 05:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
bill what we hear from the restaurants
 
05:06:01.430 --> 05:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
that we've been working with is that
 
05:06:05.110 --> 05:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
they really need a Level Playing
 
05:06:09.070 --> 05:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
Field one owner said that he's minimized
 
05:06:12.150 --> 05:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
accessories that are provided without
 
05:06:15.470 --> 05:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
request but that if he doesn't include
 
05:06:19.110 --> 05:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
utensils for example in the Bool that
 
05:06:23.788 --> 05:06:23.798 align:start position:0%
they uh that they sell for takeout he's
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to getting rated negatively
 
05:06:31.910 --> 05:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
online um so we know restaurants are are
 
05:06:35.670 --> 05:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
still pretty fragile post pandemic I
 
05:06:40.350 --> 05:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
have not heard um I think representative
 
05:06:43.750 --> 05:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
Gibbs raised the question about whether
 
05:06:46.868 --> 05:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
this would slow down service and I have
 
05:06:50.670 --> 05:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
heard no comments about that um if
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
people are aware that they need to ask
 
05:06:56.350 --> 05:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
when they walk in they'll know that
 
05:06:58.548 --> 05:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get something
 
05:07:01.788 --> 05:07:01.798 align:start position:0%
automatically will'll be ready to ask
 
05:07:04.190 --> 05:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
and I I think as representative burough
 
05:07:08.750 --> 05:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
pointed out a lot of the online ordering
 
05:07:12.990 --> 05:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
apps allow you to include that question
 
05:07:15.430 --> 05:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
so that that would be addressed in that
 
05:07:19.910 --> 05:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
way this bill is very straightforward it
 
05:07:23.788 --> 05:07:23.798 align:start position:0%
costs customers state governments and
 
05:07:27.110 --> 05:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities basically nothing it
 
05:07:30.150 --> 05:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
saves money for restaurants and cafes
 
05:07:33.990 --> 05:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
and reduces municipal waste and litter
 
05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
if customers need and want these
 
05:07:41.590 --> 05:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
accessory items all they have to do is
 
05:07:46.030 --> 05:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
ask otherwise we can all just skip the
 
05:07:49.470 --> 05:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
stuff I urge you to vote ought to pass
 
05:07:51.750 --> 05:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
05:07:53.910 --> 05:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
1207 thank
 
05:07:56.190 --> 05:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
05:07:58.990 --> 05:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
Burrows thank you for taking my question
 
05:08:01.150 --> 05:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
just to understand the I see that you're
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
ni skip the stuff low
 
05:08:04.430 --> 05:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
are you the stores that you're working
 
05:08:06.430 --> 05:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
with I think you said do are they
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
putting up this logo in their stores or
 
05:08:10.270 --> 05:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
this is something that you're promoting
 
05:08:10.280 --> 05:08:11.910 align:start position:0%
this is something that you're promoting
to

05:08:11.910 --> 05:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:08:16.470 --> 05:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
educate what we do we um go around meet
 
05:08:20.708 --> 05:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
with owners and managers we provide
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
posters like this um some people put
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
them in their Windows some people put
 
05:08:32.270 --> 05:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
them on the the areas where they have a
 
05:08:34.750 --> 05:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
accessories that people can pick up as
 
05:08:39.070 --> 05:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
they walk out the door um and we provide
 
05:08:44.830 --> 05:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
them with an educational sheet about why
 
05:08:48.190 --> 05:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
this is um being
 
05:08:51.708 --> 05:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
initiated the benefits to them as well
 
05:08:53.910 --> 05:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
as some other information that might be
 
05:08:55.750 --> 05:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
of use to the
 
05:08:58.910 --> 05:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants followup CH for for the
 
05:09:02.830 --> 05:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
question so I'm just wondering if I if
 
05:09:05.708 --> 05:09:05.718 align:start position:0%
if I live in Dover or wherever and I'm
 
05:09:07.670 --> 05:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
get to know what skip the stuff is and I
 
05:09:09.788 --> 05:09:09.798 align:start position:0%
see that logo in the window I'm going to
 
05:09:11.990 --> 05:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
be more likely to go into that store
 
05:09:14.030 --> 05:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
right um so exactly I mean I'm just
 
05:09:16.030 --> 05:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if that's a better way to go
 
05:09:18.070 --> 05:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
rather than making it a law because I
 
05:09:20.230 --> 05:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
mean that's what happened with the GMOs
 
05:09:21.990 --> 05:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
that became you know there that little
 
05:09:24.990 --> 05:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
no GMOs uh label I think that's been
 
05:09:27.070 --> 05:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
really effective and I think that might
 
05:09:29.190 --> 05:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
be even more effective than creating a
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
law just a
 
05:09:31.120 --> 05:09:35.708 align:start position:0%
law just a
thought

05:09:35.708 --> 05:09:35.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:35.718 --> 05:09:36.910 align:start position:0%
 
all

05:09:36.910 --> 05:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:09:40.830 --> 05:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:44.708 --> 05:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
much okay uh
 
05:09:50.628 --> 05:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:52.670 --> 05:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
Foundation that's
 
05:09:58.548 --> 05:09:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:01.230 --> 05:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
one good afternoon thank you to the
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
chair and members of of the committee my
 
05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
name is Heidi trarco at the conservation
 
05:10:07.230 --> 05:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
law Foundation we're a nonprofit
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
environmental advocacy group and I'm
 
05:10:11.548 --> 05:10:11.558 align:start position:0%
part of CF zero waste
 
05:10:14.310 --> 05:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
team and I am here to urge the committee
 
05:10:18.430 --> 05:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
to to vote ought to pass on HB
 
05:10:21.110 --> 05:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
1207 and um it's been mentioned a little
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
bit um in some of the prior testimony
 
05:10:26.788 --> 05:10:26.798 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to draw the committee's
 
05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
attention to our state law which
 
05:10:31.830 --> 05:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
requires the state to achieve certain
 
05:10:34.350 --> 05:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
way waste R reduction goals and waste
 
05:10:37.390 --> 05:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
diversion goals and this law was enacted
 
05:10:40.910 --> 05:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
25 years ago so in 1990 the legislature
 
05:10:42.270 --> 05:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
determined that we should have a waste
 
05:10:44.390 --> 05:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
reduction and diversion goal the goal
 
05:10:47.070 --> 05:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
was uh enacted later on in the 90s and
 
05:10:50.150 --> 05:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
for 25 years we've had these goals and
 
05:10:53.150 --> 05:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
made no progress we continue to permit
 
05:10:55.350 --> 05:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
landfills and we continue to import
 
05:10:57.470 --> 05:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
waste from out of state and we import
 
05:10:59.788 --> 05:10:59.798 align:start position:0%
about 50% of our waste from out of state
 
05:11:01.990 --> 05:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of private for-profit
 
05:11:02.000 --> 05:11:03.350 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of private for-profit
landfill

05:11:03.350 --> 05:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
05:11:05.948 --> 05:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
companies we can do something about this
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
and we need to do something about this
 
05:11:11.270 --> 05:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
so the waste diversion goal is to reduce
 
05:11:16.390 --> 05:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
our waste by 25% by 2030 and 40% by 2050
 
05:11:18.270 --> 05:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
and this is established by the
 
05:11:20.628 --> 05:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
legislature the legislature has also
 
05:11:23.548 --> 05:11:23.558 align:start position:0%
enacted our Waste Management hierarchy
 
05:11:26.910 --> 05:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
which puts Source reduction as the top
 
05:11:29.708 --> 05:11:29.718 align:start position:0%
tier the top choice for how to manage
 
05:11:32.110 --> 05:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
our waste and so if we are going going
 
05:11:33.948 --> 05:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
to do Source reduction we have to take
 
05:11:36.830 --> 05:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
measures to reduce the S our waste at
 
05:11:38.910 --> 05:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
the source and this bill is a very
 
05:11:42.310 --> 05:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
straightforward Source reduction bill so
 
05:11:43.750 --> 05:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
um following the state's Waste
 
05:11:46.070 --> 05:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
Management hierarchy this bill should be
 
05:11:48.230 --> 05:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
a top priority for this committee and
 
05:11:49.868 --> 05:11:49.878 align:start position:0%
for this
 
05:11:52.190 --> 05:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
legislature um and in fact the state
 
05:11:54.070 --> 05:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
updated the solid waste management plan
 
05:11:58.030 --> 05:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
in 2022 and the first goal in that plan
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
is to reduce our
 
05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
waste and according to the Department of
 
05:12:05.070 --> 05:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services the top goal is
 
05:12:08.990 --> 05:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
to reduce the quantity of solid waste
 
05:12:11.830 --> 05:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
generated and the a strategy to do that
 
05:12:15.310 --> 05:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
is to explore legislation including um
 
05:12:17.948 --> 05:12:17.958 align:start position:0%
programs such as this to reduce single
 
05:12:20.990 --> 05:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
use products so
 
05:12:24.948 --> 05:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
um this is really uh an easy step it
 
05:12:27.350 --> 05:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
should be in beginning step to reduce
 
05:12:30.190 --> 05:12:30.200 align:start position:0%
our waste and as you've heard um it is
 
05:12:31.868 --> 05:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
not a ban on any products and anybody
 
05:12:33.510 --> 05:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
body who wants these products can have
 
05:12:36.910 --> 05:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
them and so I think uh it is a pretty
 
05:12:39.030 --> 05:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
straightforward measure I would not
 
05:12:42.230 --> 05:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
there was some um concerns from the
 
05:12:45.230 --> 05:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
hospitality Association regarding
 
05:12:46.990 --> 05:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
alternatives to plastic wear being more
 
05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
expensive uh this bill doesn't
 
05:12:50.990 --> 05:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
contemplate alternatives to plastic wear
 
05:12:52.910 --> 05:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's um an opt-in so if you want plastic
 
05:12:54.190 --> 05:12:54.200 align:start position:0%
wear you can have it and if you don't
 
05:12:56.430 --> 05:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
want it you don't need it um so the same
 
05:12:58.670 --> 05:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
with the sanitation concerns um this
 
05:13:00.510 --> 05:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't replace the plastic wear
 
05:13:02.350 --> 05:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
with Alternatives it's just an op in to
 
05:13:06.590 --> 05:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:08.750 --> 05:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
use um and with that we have some
 
05:13:10.430 --> 05:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
detailed testimony about the bill which
 
05:13:12.670 --> 05:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
I will um circulate but we urge the
 
05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:16.320 --> 05:13:17.948 align:start position:0%

05:16:23.910 --> 05:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
several container deposit system bills
 
05:16:26.310 --> 05:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
also known as bottle bills and I'll
 
05:16:28.230 --> 05:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
refer to it that way because it's it's
 
05:16:32.110 --> 05:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
just easier have gone down to defeat so
 
05:16:34.430 --> 05:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
why this bill and why
 
05:16:37.868 --> 05:16:37.878 align:start position:0%
now um this is a bottle bill um this is
 
05:16:41.230 --> 05:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
the first bottle bill that I have read
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
that streams streamlines the process
 
05:16:48.628 --> 05:16:48.638 align:start position:0%
makes it less con uh complicated and is
 
05:16:50.990 --> 05:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
understandable I have looked at Michigan
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
Oregon Maine and a few
 
05:16:56.750 --> 05:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
others producers are now recognizing the
 
05:16:59.230 --> 05:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
importance of their role in reducing
 
05:17:01.430 --> 05:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
trash from the products they produced
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
prod sell and from which they generate
 
05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
profits this trend is called epr
 
05:17:10.708 --> 05:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
extended producer
 
05:17:13.548 --> 05:17:13.558 align:start position:0%
responsibility it transfers disposal
 
05:17:16.430 --> 05:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
costs for their packaging from
 
05:17:18.708 --> 05:17:18.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities to the
 
05:17:22.310 --> 05:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
producer in the ENA committee on which I
 
05:17:25.510 --> 05:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
serve yesterday an epr bill for
 
05:17:27.430 --> 05:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
packaging was
 
05:17:30.070 --> 05:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
introduced although it is recognized
 
05:17:31.910 --> 05:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
that the bill needs work
 
05:17:34.830 --> 05:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
industry is supportive of the concept of
 
05:17:38.110 --> 05:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
epr and bottle bills have a long history
 
05:17:41.310 --> 05:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
as the foundation of epr with the
 
05:17:45.310 --> 05:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
Michigan bottle Bill going back to
 
05:17:48.390 --> 05:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
1978 another reason why I've introduced
 
05:17:50.750 --> 05:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is because tipping fees
 
05:17:53.788 --> 05:17:53.798 align:start position:0%
continue to increase as landfill space
 
05:17:56.948 --> 05:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
becomes scarcer on the ENA committee we
 
05:18:00.270 --> 05:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
do a lot of work in terms of of landfill
 
05:18:04.150 --> 05:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
um and landfill uh citing issues tipping
 
05:18:08.350 --> 05:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
fees are based on weight any item uh any
 
05:18:10.390 --> 05:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
items that can be taken out of the waist
 
05:18:13.990 --> 05:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
stream help decrease the cost to
 
05:18:16.430 --> 05:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities the conquered monitor on
 
05:18:19.430 --> 05:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
Sunday had an article on recycling in
 
05:18:21.868 --> 05:18:21.878 align:start position:0%
one case tipping fees have gone up from
 
05:18:26.190 --> 05:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
$30 a ton to $90 a ton with
 
05:18:28.750 --> 05:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities having no control over
 
05:18:28.760 --> 05:18:29.670 align:start position:0%
municipalities having no control over
this

05:18:29.670 --> 05:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:18:32.628 --> 05:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
cost New Hampshire has not even met the
 
05:18:36.430 --> 05:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
recycling goals the legislature set in
 
05:18:39.868 --> 05:18:39.878 align:start position:0%
1993 we are swimming in trash and we
 
05:18:42.548 --> 05:18:42.558 align:start position:0%
really have to look at a way to begin to
 
05:18:47.708 --> 05:18:47.718 align:start position:0%
control this um as a society we must
 
05:18:49.948 --> 05:18:49.958 align:start position:0%
understand that mineral resources are
 
05:18:52.470 --> 05:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
finite and that some of what we call
 
05:18:56.510 --> 05:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
trash has value even now we are
 
05:19:00.070 --> 05:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
importing primary aluminum sheet because
 
05:19:01.788 --> 05:19:01.798 align:start position:0%
we no longer have the
 
05:19:04.270 --> 05:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
resources in the United States to
 
05:19:08.628 --> 05:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
produce a produce primary aluminum sheet
 
05:19:10.510 --> 05:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
um for
 
05:19:13.708 --> 05:19:13.718 align:start position:0%
cans aluminum cans can be made of
 
05:19:16.390 --> 05:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
secondary aluminum sheet which comes
 
05:19:19.868 --> 05:19:19.878 align:start position:0%
from recycled cans a bottle bill has
 
05:19:22.750 --> 05:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
shown to increase recycling rates
 
05:19:24.750 --> 05:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
dramatically while increasing the
 
05:19:28.030 --> 05:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
quality of the recycled material
 
05:19:30.910 --> 05:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
something the industry welcomes I spoke
 
05:19:33.310 --> 05:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
Rec recently uh with a govern government
 
05:19:36.510 --> 05:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
relations person from the manufacturing
 
05:19:40.030 --> 05:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
can Institute and they would welcome a
 
05:19:42.230 --> 05:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
bill like this because it would in
 
05:19:44.788 --> 05:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
dramatically increase the recycling
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
rates of aluminum and therefore they
 
05:19:49.190 --> 05:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
would have more material to work with
 
05:19:53.150 --> 05:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
and would have to import less so what's
 
05:19:56.470 --> 05:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
the advantage of this bill it puts the
 
05:19:59.750 --> 05:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
industry in Char in charge by allowing
 
05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
them to create a PR a producer
 
05:20:06.070 --> 05:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility organization to manage
 
05:20:08.868 --> 05:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
the program previous bills that have
 
05:20:13.150 --> 05:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
been presented um were of concern uh
 
05:20:17.430 --> 05:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
because they had um government agencies
 
05:20:20.190 --> 05:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
in charge of the program and it didn't
 
05:20:22.590 --> 05:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
appear to be coste effective so one
 
05:20:25.750 --> 05:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
we're putting uh producers in charge of
 
05:20:25.760 --> 05:20:26.510 align:start position:0%
we're putting uh producers in charge of
the

05:20:26.510 --> 05:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:20:29.868 --> 05:20:29.878 align:start position:0%
program it puts Dees in charge of
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
oversight and covers and PR cover all
 
05:20:35.788 --> 05:20:35.798 align:start position:0%
cost of this oversight
 
05:20:40.110 --> 05:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility so the cost to the
 
05:20:44.350 --> 05:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayer is um non-existent because it's
 
05:20:47.948 --> 05:20:47.958 align:start position:0%
going to come out of the the Redemption
 
05:20:47.958 --> 05:20:48.670 align:start position:0%
going to come out of the the Redemption
uh

05:20:48.670 --> 05:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:20:51.230 --> 05:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
payments it transfers the cost of
 
05:20:52.990 --> 05:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
disposal from the
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities and therefore the
 
05:20:58.110 --> 05:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayer to companies that produce
 
05:21:02.110 --> 05:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
it it gives retail outlets to discretion
 
05:21:04.590 --> 05:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
in where to locate redemption centers
 
05:21:07.310 --> 05:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
and it compensates them for their
 
05:21:10.548 --> 05:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
space it enables other entities to
 
05:21:13.030 --> 05:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
become redemption centers if they so
 
05:21:16.990 --> 05:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
choose because we understand that um the
 
05:21:18.990 --> 05:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
the needs and requirements in the North
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
Country may be a lot different uh than
 
05:21:23.470 --> 05:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing in let's say Nashua
 
05:21:26.910 --> 05:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester or or other uh
 
05:21:30.670 --> 05:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
cities murfs which are material recovery
 
05:21:35.230 --> 05:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
facil facilities okay receive 50% of the
 
05:21:39.230 --> 05:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
Redemption value per container type they
 
05:21:42.430 --> 05:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
also receive an annual payment of 5% of
 
05:21:45.430 --> 05:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
scrap value from the beverage container
 
05:21:48.470 --> 05:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
material the organization sold the
 
05:21:51.430 --> 05:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
previous year okay so we're trying to
 
05:21:55.548 --> 05:21:55.558 align:start position:0%
make a bill that is fair in which
 
05:21:57.628 --> 05:21:57.638 align:start position:0%
everybody is probably going to take a
 
05:22:01.150 --> 05:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
little bit of a hit but um they you know
 
05:22:04.670 --> 05:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
they it will be done fairly and uh you
 
05:22:08.110 --> 05:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
know do it in a way where um you know
 
05:22:10.990 --> 05:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
the in the end the environment and the
 
05:22:12.868 --> 05:22:12.878 align:start position:0%
economy can also
 
05:22:16.350 --> 05:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
benefit um this bill will trigger the
 
05:22:19.350 --> 05:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
lowering of the beer tax from 30 cents
 
05:22:22.310 --> 05:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
per gallon to 18 cents per gallon
 
05:22:24.590 --> 05:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
thereby giving industry the option to
 
05:22:27.350 --> 05:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
reinvest those savings or pass them on
 
05:22:27.360 --> 05:22:28.628 align:start position:0%
reinvest those savings or pass them on
to

05:22:28.628 --> 05:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:22:31.948 --> 05:22:31.958 align:start position:0%
Consumers and although there are other
 
05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
um important points in this bill I will
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
say lastly that there is a grant and
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
education program
 
05:22:41.310 --> 05:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
requirement um and it is really
 
05:22:45.150 --> 05:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
imperative that we continue to educate s
 
05:22:48.150 --> 05:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh successive Generations on the value
 
05:22:52.190 --> 05:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
of reduce reuse and recycle what we have
 
05:22:56.470 --> 05:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
done in the past is done you know um we
 
05:22:59.350 --> 05:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
blast out an educational program and
 
05:23:01.708 --> 05:23:01.718 align:start position:0%
then nothing happens for a long time the
 
05:23:03.750 --> 05:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
other thing is is we don't have what I
 
05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
would call a point of sale education
 
05:23:09.750 --> 05:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
program and I think something like this
 
05:23:12.548 --> 05:23:12.558 align:start position:0%
a bill like this could begin to do point
 
05:23:15.990 --> 05:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
of sale as well as the broad um
 
05:23:17.990 --> 05:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
marketing programs that have happened in
 
05:23:20.230 --> 05:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
in the past the other thing that I was
 
05:23:21.788 --> 05:23:21.798 align:start position:0%
thinking about which I think could be
 
05:23:24.708 --> 05:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
very interesting um right now what you
 
05:23:27.030 --> 05:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
have in several communities in New
 
05:23:30.350 --> 05:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is they're not even recycling
 
05:23:32.110 --> 05:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh plastic plastic they they've just
 
05:23:34.910 --> 05:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
stopped it okay if we are going to have
 
05:23:39.670 --> 05:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
a Redemption value on on plastic okay uh
 
05:23:42.548 --> 05:23:42.558 align:start position:0%
one that helps the consumer okay but the
 
05:23:44.590 --> 05:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
other thing is is that there will be
 
05:23:47.030 --> 05:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
more money going into the fund and I
 
05:23:48.590 --> 05:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that we really
 
05:23:51.548 --> 05:23:51.558 align:start position:0%
want to push for going forward is to be
 
05:23:56.948 --> 05:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
able to have uh more recycling um more
 
05:24:00.270 --> 05:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
industry come to New Hampshire um that
 
05:24:04.750 --> 05:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
can hand hand Le recycled um uh recycled
 
05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
material and I think the biggest thing
 
05:24:10.150 --> 05:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
is any municipality that you go to will
 
05:24:13.150 --> 05:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
say the biggest issue that they have is
 
05:24:16.590 --> 05:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
glass glass is heavy uh it doesn't
 
05:24:19.150 --> 05:24:19.160 align:start position:0%
produce a lot of money on the recycle
 
05:24:22.190 --> 05:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
markets okay and they would love to get
 
05:24:25.548 --> 05:24:25.558 align:start position:0%
rid of glass out of their um Municipal
 
05:24:28.788 --> 05:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
streams and I think this right now my
 
05:24:30.230 --> 05:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
understanding with the northeast
 
05:24:30.240 --> 05:24:31.270 align:start position:0%
understanding with the northeast
regional

05:24:31.270 --> 05:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
regional
 
05:24:31.280 --> 05:24:32.590 align:start position:0%
regional
Recovery

05:24:32.590 --> 05:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
Recovery
 
05:24:36.230 --> 05:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
Association is that um recycled glass is
 
05:24:38.230 --> 05:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
going in in two ways one it's being
 
05:24:42.190 --> 05:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
crushed and put in um roadways and the
 
05:24:44.310 --> 05:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
other thing is is that organization is
 
05:24:48.070 --> 05:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
sending it to Canada uh for actual
 
05:24:50.070 --> 05:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
recycling I think they melt it down and
 
05:24:54.150 --> 05:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
they make new um glass bottles out of it
 
05:24:57.350 --> 05:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
we are also um running out of or have
 
05:25:00.230 --> 05:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
runed out of the silica maybe that we
 
05:25:02.948 --> 05:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
used to to make glass so I think that
 
05:25:05.430 --> 05:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
would be an excellent opportunity for us
 
05:25:07.350 --> 05:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to use some of the money from
 
05:25:11.350 --> 05:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
this fund and maybe have a glass
 
05:25:14.430 --> 05:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
recycling processing facility in New
 
05:25:17.350 --> 05:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um that could benefit maybe
 
05:25:20.190 --> 05:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
just New Hampshire or the entire region
 
05:25:24.110 --> 05:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
if we needed to have more um re you know
 
05:25:27.750 --> 05:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
more um glass to go through that so in
 
05:25:30.030 --> 05:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
closing I would like to say that for
 
05:25:31.868 --> 05:25:31.878 align:start position:0%
those in the industry that say they
 
05:25:35.350 --> 05:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
support epr but this bill is not the
 
05:25:39.990 --> 05:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle I say let's use HB 1636 as a
 
05:25:43.110 --> 05:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
template to make epr a reality in New
 
05:25:45.750 --> 05:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is a fair bill in that
 
05:25:47.868 --> 05:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
everyone must make some concessions for
 
05:25:50.628 --> 05:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
the good of the economy and and the
 
05:25:54.310 --> 05:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:57.390 --> 05:25:57.400 align:start position:0%
you okay uh represent
 
05:26:01.590 --> 05:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
spear just a question uh do you know of
 
05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
any state that is doing something like
 
05:26:06.270 --> 05:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
this and how successful they might
 
05:26:09.470 --> 05:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
be that has a bottle bill that yeah that
 
05:26:11.430 --> 05:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
has a bill similar where producers are
 
05:26:13.590 --> 05:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for collecting well a
 
05:26:16.628 --> 05:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility is really is
 
05:26:22.150 --> 05:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
really gaining um uh momentum okay and
 
05:26:24.750 --> 05:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
the one thing that like I said before a
 
05:26:26.910 --> 05:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
lot of the other bills had problems with
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
is that it put the government okay so
 
05:26:34.270 --> 05:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
we're at actually you know we this bill
 
05:26:39.190 --> 05:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh wants to um and the word Escapes Me
 
05:26:41.270 --> 05:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
want wants to come together with
 
05:26:43.708 --> 05:26:43.718 align:start position:0%
industry okay and and I will say to you
 
05:26:46.948 --> 05:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
this is you know this is a a template
 
05:26:50.190 --> 05:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
after I end my talk it will become your
 
05:26:52.948 --> 05:26:52.958 align:start position:0%
bill but I think what's really important
 
05:26:54.310 --> 05:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
here is to think
 
05:26:58.788 --> 05:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
about we need to start someplace okay we
 
05:27:01.868 --> 05:27:01.878 align:start position:0%
we need to start someplace and this bill
 
05:27:05.230 --> 05:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
as it's presented you know may not be
 
05:27:07.628 --> 05:27:07.638 align:start position:0%
the bill that gets passed but I think we
 
05:27:10.110 --> 05:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
can start to look at it and to continue
 
05:27:12.390 --> 05:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
to educate ourselves this is this is a
 
05:27:16.910 --> 05:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
very complex issue and I and My Hope was
 
05:27:19.708 --> 05:27:19.718 align:start position:0%
in presenting this is that we could work
 
05:27:21.990 --> 05:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
together to craft a bill that would work
 
05:27:26.830 --> 05:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and when I saw the P
 
05:27:30.788 --> 05:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
um model that was being presed I really
 
05:27:33.430 --> 05:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
felt that that was a key part in our
 
05:27:37.788 --> 05:27:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:39.868 --> 05:27:39.878 align:start position:0%
moving representative
 
05:27:42.628 --> 05:27:42.638 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:27:46.390 --> 05:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um as with
 
05:27:49.628 --> 05:27:49.638 align:start position:0%
the previous Bill uh I support the idea
 
05:27:53.030 --> 05:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
of of this bill but I have two questions
 
05:27:58.510 --> 05:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
one minor and one major and more General
 
05:28:01.030 --> 05:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh the first question the minor one has
 
05:28:03.190 --> 05:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
to do with lines 13 and
 
05:28:03.200 --> 05:28:04.910 align:start position:0%
to do with lines 13 and
14

05:28:04.910 --> 05:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
14
 
05:28:08.788 --> 05:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
um and it says uh a beverage container
 
05:28:11.708 --> 05:28:11.718 align:start position:0%
means a prepackaged container such as a
 
05:28:15.030 --> 05:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
carton pouch or as septic packageing is
 
05:28:17.230 --> 05:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
there some reason why can and bottle are
 
05:28:19.070 --> 05:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
not in
 
05:28:22.948 --> 05:28:22.958 align:start position:0%
there okay uh what page oh you're saying
 
05:28:24.510 --> 05:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
first page the first the first page of
 
05:28:26.910 --> 05:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
the bill lines 13 and
 
05:28:29.948 --> 05:28:29.958 align:start position:0%
14 uh let's see and definition of
 
05:28:29.958 --> 05:28:35.390 align:start position:0%
14 uh let's see and definition of
Beverage

05:28:35.390 --> 05:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:37.510 --> 05:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
container and it's a
 
05:28:40.948 --> 05:28:40.958 align:start position:0%
definition it's it's Roman numeral 3
 
05:28:45.708 --> 05:28:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:49.750 --> 05:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:52.470 --> 05:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
is yeah I'm sorry representative you're
 
05:28:54.948 --> 05:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
saying it's page two I'm going to show
 
05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
you no no okay it's page
 
05:28:59.320 --> 05:29:02.350 align:start position:0%
you no no okay it's page
two

05:29:02.350 --> 05:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:06.670 --> 05:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:10.030 --> 05:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
one bage yes it's the defin it's under
 
05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
definition of beverage container okay
 
05:29:14.350 --> 05:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
okay so it's it's
 
05:29:19.270 --> 05:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:19.280 --> 05:29:23.708 align:start position:0%
 
page

05:29:23.708 --> 05:29:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:27.548 --> 05:29:27.558 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's it okay I would say
 
05:29:29.030 --> 05:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's under
 
05:29:35.910 --> 05:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
here uh where it says um is made uh is
 
05:29:39.070 --> 05:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
made of any multimaterial or material
 
05:29:42.230 --> 05:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to glass
 
05:29:44.070 --> 05:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
plastic or
 
05:29:48.310 --> 05:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
metal it I notice that honestly it's
 
05:29:51.470 --> 05:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
confusing um but and if I were a lawyer
 
05:29:55.788 --> 05:29:55.798 align:start position:0%
representing a a um uh a seller the
 
05:29:57.788 --> 05:29:57.798 align:start position:0%
first thing I would argue is this
 
05:29:59.670 --> 05:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover cans and bottles they're
 
05:29:59.680 --> 05:30:00.830 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover cans and bottles they're
excluded

05:30:00.830 --> 05:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
05:30:02.270 --> 05:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
um so that's something you might want to
 
05:30:04.150 --> 05:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
take into account I mean that's clearly
 
05:30:07.948 --> 05:30:07.958 align:start position:0%
something that we could uh work SM no
 
05:30:10.628 --> 05:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
point it out yeah uh okay the more
 
05:30:13.190 --> 05:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
general question and I have to say that
 
05:30:15.868 --> 05:30:15.878 align:start position:0%
after reading this whole bill I had
 
05:30:19.030 --> 05:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
planned to ask why is it so excessively
 
05:30:21.670 --> 05:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
complicated why is there so much if it's
 
05:30:24.990 --> 05:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
a then we do B and if it's C then we do
 
05:30:27.948 --> 05:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
D and if it's e then we do F uh but
 
05:30:30.510 --> 05:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
after hearing you say that the this was
 
05:30:32.470 --> 05:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
the Least Complicated bottle Bill you'd
 
05:30:36.190 --> 05:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
ever seen uh I have to ask how could it
 
05:30:39.190 --> 05:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:42.628 --> 05:30:42.638 align:start position:0%
complicated representative Gibbs I can I
 
05:30:45.830 --> 05:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
can show you the Michigan Bill trust me
 
05:30:48.270 --> 05:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
I have I have gone through a lot of
 
05:30:50.430 --> 05:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
bills uh Oregon being one of them
 
05:30:53.230 --> 05:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
Michigan being one of them Maine be
 
05:30:56.150 --> 05:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
being another one and I have tried to
 
05:31:01.230 --> 05:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
map out how the money you know is
 
05:31:04.750 --> 05:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
distributed I can truthfully tell you
 
05:31:08.190 --> 05:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
okay um this is a dream compared to
 
05:31:10.390 --> 05:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
those other bills it's a
 
05:31:13.150 --> 05:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
dream and and I wish we could make it
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
even more simple maybe the subcommittee
 
05:31:20.030 --> 05:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
could do that but um it it's really a
 
05:31:22.510 --> 05:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
complicated it it's really a complicated
 
05:31:25.030 --> 05:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
process because you have so many
 
05:31:27.990 --> 05:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
different players okay not not only do
 
05:31:30.230 --> 05:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
you have I mean so think about the
 
05:31:33.190 --> 05:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
transfer stations where they separate
 
05:31:36.590 --> 05:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
their recyclables think about you know
 
05:31:40.910 --> 05:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh NASA and gtown that have single you
 
05:31:42.070 --> 05:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
know single
 
05:31:46.110 --> 05:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
stream um then think about um the Cassel
 
05:31:48.788 --> 05:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
the republics the pinards you know that
 
05:31:52.390 --> 05:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
have a a a piece of the action um you
 
05:31:55.030 --> 05:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
know um think about the transfer
 
05:31:58.430 --> 05:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
stations that might you know uh uh want
 
05:32:00.230 --> 05:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
to keep things the way they are it
 
05:32:06.590 --> 05:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:10.270 --> 05:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
sorry repr bar just a quick question
 
05:32:11.708 --> 05:32:11.718 align:start position:0%
because I don't I didn't hear an answer
 
05:32:13.910 --> 05:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
to representative Spear's question has
 
05:32:16.990 --> 05:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
any other state passed this this uh done
 
05:32:17.000 --> 05:32:17.708 align:start position:0%
any other state passed this this uh done
the

05:32:17.708 --> 05:32:17.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:32:21.310 --> 05:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
PR's you you mean yeah um I can check
 
05:32:26.470 --> 05:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
for you okay um yeah I'm not I know that
 
05:32:29.070 --> 05:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
Illinois that that this bill was be a
 
05:32:30.548 --> 05:32:30.558 align:start position:0%
similar bill was being being introduced
 
05:32:32.868 --> 05:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
in Illinois and in Maryland I don't
 
05:32:37.510 --> 05:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
think it's passed but um you know Oregon
 
05:32:40.350 --> 05:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
might have maybe but but let me check
 
05:32:41.708 --> 05:32:41.718 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll get back to the committee
 
05:32:44.430 --> 05:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
on that I thought that Maine and Oregon
 
05:32:49.110 --> 05:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
both had it you know I'm not I'm not
 
05:32:51.350 --> 05:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
sure yeah
 
05:32:53.948 --> 05:32:53.958 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
05:32:56.708 --> 05:32:56.718 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
05:33:00.110 --> 05:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh if you're talking about cost savings
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer and going on I guess the
 
05:33:06.110 --> 05:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
problem I have right out of the block
 
05:33:09.470 --> 05:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
and and not sure I can it can I can cure
 
05:33:11.948 --> 05:33:11.958 align:start position:0%
this problem is that we're asking
 
05:33:16.110 --> 05:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
everyone who buys a six-pack to pay an
 
05:33:20.510 --> 05:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
extra uh it looks like 10 cents 60 cents
 
05:33:23.670 --> 05:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay so we're raising the cost of uh
 
05:33:27.510 --> 05:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
beverages in no the there the fiscal
 
05:33:31.430 --> 05:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
note I I the fiscal not is incorrect
 
05:33:32.590 --> 05:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
okay well I'm just looking reading the
 
05:33:35.270 --> 05:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
law it says no no no except on each
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
bever sold or offered at sale and the
 
05:33:38.628 --> 05:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
state shall have the following
 
05:33:44.430 --> 05:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
Redemption refund value of 10 cents y so
 
05:33:46.510 --> 05:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
theoretically that 10 cents has got to
 
05:33:48.390 --> 05:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
come from somewhere so it's going to be
 
05:33:51.190 --> 05:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
added to the sale of the product right
 
05:33:53.990 --> 05:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
and you will only pay for that if you
 
05:33:57.150 --> 05:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
choose to uh throw the can in the
 
05:33:59.390 --> 05:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
garbage right if you choose to redeem
 
05:34:00.510 --> 05:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
the can
 
05:34:02.670 --> 05:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
okay then you get that 10 cents back I
 
05:34:05.230 --> 05:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
understand that okay and and believe you
 
05:34:10.190 --> 05:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
me I started out um in college uh
 
05:34:12.310 --> 05:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
actually my first job in Vermont and
 
05:34:14.510 --> 05:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
they had the bottle Bill and so I've
 
05:34:17.190 --> 05:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
known about the value it was great I I
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
had a dormatory because it was a private
 
05:34:21.150 --> 05:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
school and at Christmas break I went
 
05:34:22.990 --> 05:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
through and got all the empties in all
 
05:34:25.430 --> 05:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
the kids' rooms and B bought myself a
 
05:34:28.110 --> 05:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
turkey and had a good old thanks thanks
 
05:34:30.230 --> 05:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
to the bottle bill but it does require
 
05:34:33.150 --> 05:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
people to then take these things back it
 
05:34:34.628 --> 05:34:34.638 align:start position:0%
requires people to collect it and take
 
05:34:38.070 --> 05:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
it back okay so not withstanding that
 
05:34:40.030 --> 05:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
even today when I was down you know
 
05:34:43.190 --> 05:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
eating at our restaurant here and I
 
05:34:44.868 --> 05:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
looked at the garbage can and they're
 
05:34:47.150 --> 05:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
full of bottles and cans even though
 
05:34:49.910 --> 05:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
right next door to it is a place to put
 
05:34:52.070 --> 05:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
bottles and cans but people still throw
 
05:34:55.708 --> 05:34:55.718 align:start position:0%
them away go so my problem is is that
 
05:34:59.470 --> 05:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
we're raising the cost of beverages to
 
05:35:01.990 --> 05:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
everybody in New Hampshire right now the
 
05:35:04.750 --> 05:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
beer tax which as you duly noted is
 
05:35:07.510 --> 05:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
going to get reduced by whatever this
 
05:35:10.990 --> 05:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
does yeah the beer tax is so flat we're
 
05:35:13.948 --> 05:35:13.958 align:start position:0%
only making like $5 million a year it is
 
05:35:15.708 --> 05:35:15.718 align:start position:0%
like nothing we're our collection at 30
 
05:35:19.350 --> 05:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
cents of gal is so minimal we're barely
 
05:35:21.190 --> 05:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
having a profitable and you think about
 
05:35:22.830 --> 05:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
all the new products that on the market
 
05:35:24.270 --> 05:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
you know all these spritzers and all
 
05:35:26.190 --> 05:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
these other stuff but the beer tax is
 
05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
still that flat $5 million my my concern
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
is that what you're actually doing is
 
05:35:35.310 --> 05:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
just making it for all New Hampshire
 
05:35:39.430 --> 05:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
citizens taxpayers and all to pay
 
05:35:42.708 --> 05:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
more for their six-pack for their pay
 
05:35:43.948 --> 05:35:43.958 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to pay more you're
 
05:35:46.110 --> 05:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
assuming everyone's going to duly turn
 
05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
them in okay I'm assuming they're not
 
05:35:50.750 --> 05:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming they're still throw them in
 
05:35:53.110 --> 05:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
the garbage can okay and this thing is
 
05:35:55.310 --> 05:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
just a boond doggle for the people who's
 
05:35:57.708 --> 05:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
that processor or wherever the this
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
entity that that that
 
05:36:01.670 --> 05:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to collect them because
 
05:36:03.990 --> 05:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to turn them in well
 
05:36:06.868 --> 05:36:06.878 align:start position:0%
there's also Targets in the bill okay so
 
05:36:09.548 --> 05:36:09.558 align:start position:0%
the the producer responsibility
 
05:36:12.190 --> 05:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
organization has to meet certain targets
 
05:36:14.948 --> 05:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
I believe the first Target is 75%
 
05:36:17.470 --> 05:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
redeemable within five years and what
 
05:36:19.708 --> 05:36:19.718 align:start position:0%
happens if they don't reach the target
 
05:36:23.510 --> 05:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
if they uh then at there's uh penalties
 
05:36:25.470 --> 05:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
and more penalties so the cost of the
 
05:36:27.030 --> 05:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
beer is going to go up some more no it's
 
05:36:29.110 --> 05:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
in the B it's in the bill I know but you
 
05:36:31.110 --> 05:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
were saying every everything is just all
 
05:36:33.470 --> 05:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
you're doing is raising the cost theen
 
05:36:37.030 --> 05:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
up front when a person buys that
 
05:36:40.190 --> 05:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
sixpack that's what you're raising start
 
05:36:42.310 --> 05:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
there I'm not even going to all the
 
05:36:44.310 --> 05:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
other savings and money savings that
 
05:36:47.548 --> 05:36:47.558 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I'm talking about
 
05:36:49.350 --> 05:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
why are we
 
05:36:53.310 --> 05:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
raising beer and water anything why are
 
05:36:55.708 --> 05:36:55.718 align:start position:0%
we raising the cost of them when there's
 
05:36:57.390 --> 05:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
so much other trash that's out there
 
05:36:58.868 --> 05:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
there's so many other problems we
 
05:37:00.990 --> 05:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
haven't solved way but we're take we're
 
05:37:02.910 --> 05:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
picking on people who want to drink
 
05:37:07.390 --> 05:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
liquids and we're making them pay more
 
05:37:10.190 --> 05:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
money but rever on the reverse side
 
05:37:13.030 --> 05:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
we're only making them pay more money if
 
05:37:15.350 --> 05:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
they choose not to redeem it and you
 
05:37:17.470 --> 05:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
have to recognize those who choose not
 
05:37:20.670 --> 05:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
to redeem it those costs are then being
 
05:37:23.628 --> 05:37:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh uh transferred over to the taxpayer
 
05:37:26.070 --> 05:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
because they become a tipping fee so
 
05:37:27.708 --> 05:37:27.718 align:start position:0%
somebody's paying it one way or the
 
05:37:30.670 --> 05:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
other and I would prefer that it be paid
 
05:37:32.590 --> 05:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
you know I mean that people who are
 
05:37:35.190 --> 05:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
irresponsible pay it rather than the
 
05:37:35.200 --> 05:37:36.390 align:start position:0%
irresponsible pay it rather than the
responsible

05:37:36.390 --> 05:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
05:37:39.788 --> 05:37:39.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and what we have in this bill
 
05:37:42.270 --> 05:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
is redemption centers anybody can become
 
05:37:45.910 --> 05:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
a Redemption Center okay so most likely
 
05:37:48.310 --> 05:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
you will redeem them at the grocery
 
05:37:51.670 --> 05:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
store where you go every week okay
 
05:37:53.670 --> 05:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's what my brother does in Michigan
 
05:37:55.670 --> 05:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know you get a little ticket and it
 
05:37:58.670 --> 05:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
says okay you just got $2 or $ three do
 
05:38:01.350 --> 05:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
you go to the check out and you know you
 
05:38:04.070 --> 05:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
get two or three dollars off so
 
05:38:06.110 --> 05:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative somebody's paying one way
 
05:38:09.670 --> 05:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
or the other and I would you know choose
 
05:38:14.310 --> 05:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
um to reward people you know who um uh
 
05:38:17.070 --> 05:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
feel that they have a responsibility you
 
05:38:19.430 --> 05:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
know to our planet to our environment
 
05:38:22.670 --> 05:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
and to the economy I mean because we can
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
create new
 
05:38:27.430 --> 05:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturing uh facilities and new
 
05:38:29.350 --> 05:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
technologies are coming down the road
 
05:38:31.310 --> 05:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire should be a part of
 
05:38:33.830 --> 05:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
that because we aren't right
 
05:38:35.830 --> 05:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
now fair
 
05:38:39.190 --> 05:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
enough and can I just say one thing um I
 
05:38:41.590 --> 05:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
have the total beer tax revenue in
 
05:38:45.190 --> 05:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal um July 1
 
05:38:51.868 --> 05:38:51.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:56.190 --> 05:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:00.390 --> 05:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
9961 and uh reducing the beer tax would
 
05:39:04.590 --> 05:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
reduce it by about 5 million uh $5.2
 
05:39:08.270 --> 05:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
million and you know as we all know um
 
05:39:10.750 --> 05:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature last year
 
05:39:14.590 --> 05:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
or uh last session uh passed a bill to
 
05:39:17.190 --> 05:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
eliminate the uh dividends and interest
 
05:39:19.628 --> 05:39:19.638 align:start position:0%
tax which I think is going to eliminate
 
05:39:23.788 --> 05:39:23.798 align:start position:0%
$57 million so if we feel that
 
05:39:25.590 --> 05:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
eliminating a tax is in the best
 
05:39:28.708 --> 05:39:28.718 align:start position:0%
interest of the taxpayer then I think
 
05:39:30.830 --> 05:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know redu in the beer tax from 30
 
05:39:34.708 --> 05:39:34.718 align:start position:0%
cents to 18 cents is also in that same
 
05:39:38.948 --> 05:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:42.190 --> 05:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
Gibbs uh back to the uh question of
 
05:39:44.590 --> 05:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
penalties As I understood it the
 
05:39:46.708 --> 05:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
penalties are on the seller who runs the
 
05:39:50.070 --> 05:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
collection center but the penalty will
 
05:39:54.030 --> 05:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
be if the Redemption targets are not met
 
05:39:56.590 --> 05:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
but how can the seller force people to
 
05:39:58.350 --> 05:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
return the bottles and
 
05:39:58.360 --> 05:40:00.670 align:start position:0%
return the bottles and
cans

05:40:00.670 --> 05:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
cans
 
05:40:05.230 --> 05:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
well I mean that it's it's on the P to
 
05:40:09.270 --> 05:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
be able to create marketing programs
 
05:40:12.310 --> 05:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
okay and in and incentives so that
 
05:40:16.310 --> 05:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
people will want to return um you know
 
05:40:18.350 --> 05:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
their bottles and cans to get the
 
05:40:20.910 --> 05:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
Redemption money back I think part of
 
05:40:24.468 --> 05:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
that also you know is being smart in
 
05:40:28.468 --> 05:40:28.478 align:start position:0%
terms of uh making it easy for people to
 
05:40:30.948 --> 05:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
redeem the their bottles and cans so for
 
05:40:33.548 --> 05:40:33.558 align:start position:0%
example I mean right now you have people
 
05:40:36.190 --> 05:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
that take their bottles and cans uh you
 
05:40:39.390 --> 05:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
know to the transfer station and you you
 
05:40:41.750 --> 05:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
know so a transfer station could become
 
05:40:44.628 --> 05:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
a Redemption Center and and they could
 
05:40:46.590 --> 05:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
just redeem them there or they could
 
05:40:48.548 --> 05:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
continue you know to put them in the
 
05:40:50.628 --> 05:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
recycle bin and then their money would
 
05:40:52.430 --> 05:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
just go to the
 
05:40:57.750 --> 05:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
iset uh further question thank you uh
 
05:41:00.510 --> 05:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
when the bottles and can are returned
 
05:41:02.510 --> 05:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
could they be returned as is that is
 
05:41:04.510 --> 05:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
when you finish drinking the beverage or
 
05:41:07.030 --> 05:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
would they have to be washed no no they
 
05:41:09.070 --> 05:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
do not have to be washed and and thank
 
05:41:10.750 --> 05:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
you for raising that point because one
 
05:41:14.430 --> 05:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
of the things um uh bottle bills do a
 
05:41:16.990 --> 05:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
number of things first of all they not
 
05:41:19.788 --> 05:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
only improve uh the number of bottles
 
05:41:23.548 --> 05:41:23.558 align:start position:0%
and cans that are um returned but they
 
05:41:27.030 --> 05:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
also uh improve the quality and for
 
05:41:29.468 --> 05:41:29.478 align:start position:0%
companies to be able to recycle bottles
 
05:41:32.628 --> 05:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
and cans it's important to have the um
 
05:41:34.750 --> 05:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
the quality the other thing is it's been
 
05:41:37.430 --> 05:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
shown over and over again that having a
 
05:41:41.190 --> 05:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
bottle Bill overall um increases the
 
05:41:44.910 --> 05:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
amount of um recycling that takes place
 
05:41:47.510 --> 05:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know right now uh New Hampshire is
 
05:41:47.520 --> 05:41:51.310 align:start position:0%
you know right now uh New Hampshire is
at

05:41:51.310 --> 05:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:55.030 --> 05:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
23% okay repres Ammon thank you Mr chair
 
05:41:56.548 --> 05:41:56.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our questions I
 
05:41:58.510 --> 05:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
just want to focus on the labeling
 
05:42:00.750 --> 05:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
requirement piece of the bill uh could
 
05:42:04.030 --> 05:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
you explain what kind of uh potential
 
05:42:06.628 --> 05:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
burden that would place on the the
 
05:42:09.030 --> 05:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
container manufacturers and then just a
 
05:42:11.070 --> 05:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
second part what happens if bottles come
 
05:42:13.468 --> 05:42:13.478 align:start position:0%
from out of state that aren't labeled
 
05:42:16.110 --> 05:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
can they be recycled so two parts uh the
 
05:42:18.590 --> 05:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
bill indicates that the the only uh
 
05:42:21.190 --> 05:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
containers that can be recycled or
 
05:42:24.628 --> 05:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
redeemed uh have to be sold in the state
 
05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
now we know you know that that doesn't
 
05:42:31.830 --> 05:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
always happen but um you know that's
 
05:42:33.868 --> 05:42:33.878 align:start position:0%
what the bill states that it has to be
 
05:42:37.230 --> 05:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
sold in the state um there would be
 
05:42:40.070 --> 05:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
virtually no cost to the manufacturer
 
05:42:42.310 --> 05:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
because if you look at your you know for
 
05:42:45.030 --> 05:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
example I just bought a juice bottle um
 
05:42:46.830 --> 05:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
the other day and I was I was stunned to
 
05:42:49.468 --> 05:42:49.478 align:start position:0%
see it it's already there okay because
 
05:42:52.310 --> 05:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
there's a Redemption value from Hawaii I
 
05:42:53.868 --> 05:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
think you know so they have the things
 
05:42:55.910 --> 05:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
on their Hawaii 5 cents you know
 
05:42:58.430 --> 05:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
Connecticut or or whatever so all they
 
05:43:00.230 --> 05:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
have to do is has changed uh their
 
05:43:04.510 --> 05:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
software to add um NH 10 cents so
 
05:43:07.548 --> 05:43:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:11.230 --> 05:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
already Okay any more questions see none
 
05:43:14.070 --> 05:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay thank you uh
 
05:43:16.430 --> 05:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
just to hear the other side let's have
 
05:43:19.590 --> 05:43:19.600 align:start position:0%

05:43:42.270 --> 05:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my able assistant
 
05:43:48.350 --> 05:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:50.750 --> 05:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
problem I'm for the record my name is
 
05:43:52.910 --> 05:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
Bri deatley I'm a principal of Breezeway
 
05:43:55.788 --> 05:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
Consulting in Somerville Massachusetts
 
05:43:57.468 --> 05:43:57.478 align:start position:0%
and I am here today representing both
 
05:43:59.150 --> 05:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire beverage Association
 
05:44:01.628 --> 05:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
and the American Beverage Association uh
 
05:44:03.670 --> 05:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
who represent the New Hampshire bottlers
 
05:44:05.548 --> 05:44:05.558 align:start position:0%
and Distributors of non-alcoholic
 
05:44:09.708 --> 05:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
beverages in the state um the um
 
05:44:13.270 --> 05:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
beverage industry is uh an industry that
 
05:44:14.990 --> 05:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
has for a long time supported the
 
05:44:17.150 --> 05:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
recyclability and sustainability of our
 
05:44:19.830 --> 05:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
packaging um and we have been uh
 
05:44:22.270 --> 05:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
diligently working for the decades that
 
05:44:24.468 --> 05:44:24.478 align:start position:0%
I've worked for the industry uh on
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
improving the recyclability the
 
05:44:28.230 --> 05:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
sustainability and the recycling rates
 
05:44:30.788 --> 05:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
of our package packaging um the majority
 
05:44:33.070 --> 05:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
of our packaging is in pet bottles and
 
05:44:35.708 --> 05:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
aluminum cans both of which are
 
05:44:38.788 --> 05:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
lightweight very efficient um also
 
05:44:40.948 --> 05:44:40.958 align:start position:0%
highly recyclable and also have a very
 
05:44:43.390 --> 05:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
high recycling value that's not by
 
05:44:45.670 --> 05:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
accident we've invested in the design of
 
05:44:48.230 --> 05:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
those packages and in those materials to
 
05:44:49.830 --> 05:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that when they at the end of
 
05:44:51.990 --> 05:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
their life um they are recycled and
 
05:44:54.070 --> 05:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
recyclable back into something a new
 
05:44:56.030 --> 05:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
container that's valuable and is
 
05:44:57.628 --> 05:44:57.638 align:start position:0%
valuable for the recycling stream and
 
05:44:59.150 --> 05:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
can help pay their way through the
 
05:45:00.948 --> 05:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
system they're couple of the few
 
05:45:03.030 --> 05:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
materials in the waist stream today that
 
05:45:04.270 --> 05:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
can pay their way back through the
 
05:45:06.190 --> 05:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
system because of the value that they
 
05:45:10.390 --> 05:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
have um I will say that uh the industry
 
05:45:12.868 --> 05:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
has been directly involved in promoting
 
05:45:15.390 --> 05:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
recycling through direct investment uh
 
05:45:17.310 --> 05:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
our every bottle back program has
 
05:45:19.750 --> 05:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
committed $100 million nationally to
 
05:45:21.468 --> 05:45:21.478 align:start position:0%
investment in infrastructure which is
 
05:45:23.270 --> 05:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
really more than anybody has committed
 
05:45:24.750 --> 05:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
including the federal government to
 
05:45:27.390 --> 05:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
those programs um over the last several
 
05:45:30.030 --> 05:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
years but we have come to realize as a
 
05:45:32.270 --> 05:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
result of the industry's commitments to
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
in use of recycled material in our
 
05:45:36.350 --> 05:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
packaging uh and meeting other
 
05:45:38.670 --> 05:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
sustainability goals that we need to do
 
05:45:40.868 --> 05:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
more and that more includes in
 
05:45:43.310 --> 05:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
involvement in policy and discussions
 
05:45:45.030 --> 05:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
about around policy whether it be
 
05:45:46.910 --> 05:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility as
 
05:45:49.390 --> 05:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday or discussions about container
 
05:45:51.070 --> 05:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
deposit or bottle Bill systems like
 
05:45:52.670 --> 05:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
05:45:56.350 --> 05:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
today um I want to be clear that um as
 
05:45:59.070 --> 05:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
an industry because of the need to get
 
05:46:00.750 --> 05:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
those containers back to turn into new
 
05:46:02.910 --> 05:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
bottles and cans we do support
 
05:46:04.750 --> 05:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
well-designed policies that are designed
 
05:46:06.830 --> 05:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
to improve the recycling quantity and
 
05:46:09.990 --> 05:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
quality of material um that said we are
 
05:46:13.750 --> 05:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
in opposition to HB 1636 today because
 
05:46:15.190 --> 05:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that this is an
 
05:46:17.110 --> 05:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
efficient system that's outlined in this
 
05:46:19.350 --> 05:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation um we believe the
 
05:46:21.590 --> 05:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that's laid out uh it
 
05:46:23.390 --> 05:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
would be specified through the bill is
 
05:46:25.830 --> 05:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
redundant um we think the targets that
 
05:46:28.390 --> 05:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
are established are unrealistic um we
 
05:46:29.990 --> 05:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
think it's the bureaucratic system and
 
05:46:31.430 --> 05:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
it would really adversely affect our
 
05:46:33.788 --> 05:46:33.798 align:start position:0%
members ability to do business in New
 
05:46:36.230 --> 05:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um let me just talk briefly
 
05:46:38.948 --> 05:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
about each of those points and then um
 
05:46:41.708 --> 05:46:41.718 align:start position:0%
because I do uh work on these issues
 
05:46:43.110 --> 05:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
around the country and have worked on
 
05:46:45.628 --> 05:46:45.638 align:start position:0%
these issues uh around the world um
 
05:46:47.670 --> 05:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions about scope of
 
05:46:49.350 --> 05:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
these programs where else they operate
 
05:46:51.070 --> 05:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
how they operate and things like that if
 
05:46:54.548 --> 05:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
if that's useful um uh representative
 
05:46:57.310 --> 05:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
Duty talked about the central management
 
05:46:59.190 --> 05:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
and the use of a producer organiz ation
 
05:47:00.990 --> 05:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
to manage and direct this program and
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
that that is something of a novelty
 
05:47:05.390 --> 05:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
amongst deposit systems and that is true
 
05:47:07.390 --> 05:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
um only Oregon in the US has a program
 
05:47:10.190 --> 05:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
that's similar to that but from our
 
05:47:13.150 --> 05:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
perspective um you can't just simply say
 
05:47:15.070 --> 05:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
well the producers are in charge so it's
 
05:47:18.430 --> 05:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
good bill um as was noted earlier by
 
05:47:19.830 --> 05:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs this is an
 
05:47:22.230 --> 05:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
extremely prescriptive Bill putting the
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
producers in charge of the system and
 
05:47:26.150 --> 05:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
then prescribing the size of the signs
 
05:47:27.868 --> 05:47:27.878 align:start position:0%
in the windows of the stores where they
 
05:47:29.830 --> 05:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
take back the bottles and cans is pretty
 
05:47:31.788 --> 05:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
prescriptive doesn't leave a lot of
 
05:47:33.548 --> 05:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
flexibility for the producers and the
 
05:47:35.310 --> 05:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
retailers to work out a system that's
 
05:47:37.548 --> 05:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
efficient for consumers so when you walk
 
05:47:40.110 --> 05:47:40.120 align:start position:0%
out the front door of a Hanford in in
 
05:47:42.110 --> 05:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
West Leb and you look across the street
 
05:47:43.708 --> 05:47:43.718 align:start position:0%
and see six other stores that have
 
05:47:45.468 --> 05:47:45.478 align:start position:0%
exactly the same infastructure to take
 
05:47:46.948 --> 05:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
back the same bottles and cans you're
 
05:47:48.390 --> 05:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
not going to have a very efficient
 
05:47:50.670 --> 05:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
system and that's one of our concerns
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
with this program um it's it's
 
05:47:55.310 --> 05:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
inefficient it would result in a lot of
 
05:47:57.390 --> 05:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
redundancy a lot of excess cost that
 
05:47:59.708 --> 05:47:59.718 align:start position:0%
would ultimately be borne by
 
05:48:02.150 --> 05:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
consumers um I mentioned the Targets in
 
05:48:04.070 --> 05:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
the bill there are very high recycling
 
05:48:05.590 --> 05:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
targets that are established in this
 
05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
bill High both for Redemption rates and
 
05:48:09.750 --> 05:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
then for the recycling of the material
 
05:48:12.150 --> 05:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
that comes back it's early referenced
 
05:48:14.190 --> 05:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
that uh the the bill would include
 
05:48:17.270 --> 05:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
cartons aseptic containers uh and
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
pouches as well for which there are very
 
05:48:21.670 --> 05:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
few if any markets in this part of the
 
05:48:23.708 --> 05:48:23.718 align:start position:0%
country a lot of that material would be
 
05:48:25.510 --> 05:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
collected and simply thrown away because
 
05:48:27.230 --> 05:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to be done with it in
 
05:48:29.110 --> 05:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
Vermont for example there deposits on
 
05:48:30.350 --> 05:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
pouches they're collected from
 
05:48:31.910 --> 05:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
redemption centers and thrown away
 
05:48:34.070 --> 05:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing to do with them
 
05:48:36.708 --> 05:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
um so um you know we don't need to be
 
05:48:38.430 --> 05:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
paying the money to collect materials
 
05:48:39.948 --> 05:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
like that and bringing those back when
 
05:48:42.948 --> 05:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
they don't have value um the system is
 
05:48:45.750 --> 05:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
fairly bureaucratic as I mentioned Dees
 
05:48:47.910 --> 05:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
has more to do than it needs to do in a
 
05:48:49.948 --> 05:48:49.958 align:start position:0%
system like this uh there should be a
 
05:48:51.310 --> 05:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
lot more discretion left to the
 
05:48:53.350 --> 05:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
producers in far as making a proposal
 
05:48:56.910 --> 05:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
and having DS evaluate it um and and I
 
05:48:59.628 --> 05:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
would just sort of point out the uh
 
05:49:01.468 --> 05:49:01.478 align:start position:0%
representative Gib talks about the if a
 
05:49:04.390 --> 05:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
then B then C then d uh if you are a
 
05:49:06.548 --> 05:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
transfer station or a materials recovery
 
05:49:08.590 --> 05:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
facility and you take back bottles and
 
05:49:11.150 --> 05:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
cans that have deposits I defy you to
 
05:49:12.708 --> 05:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
figure out in this bill how it is you're
 
05:49:13.910 --> 05:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to get some kind of
 
05:49:15.190 --> 05:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
compensation because it get
 
05:49:18.788 --> 05:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily complicated to do that
 
05:49:21.910 --> 05:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's important to finally
 
05:49:23.670 --> 05:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
highlight and Mr chairman you sort of
 
05:49:26.510 --> 05:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
talked about this about raising prices I
 
05:49:28.590 --> 05:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
think it's important to realize and
 
05:49:31.510 --> 05:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
recognize the impact of a 10 or 15 cent
 
05:49:33.948 --> 05:49:33.958 align:start position:0%
deposit on a container in New Hampshire
 
05:49:35.910 --> 05:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
I manage a Redemption system for about
 
05:49:38.350 --> 05:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
85% of the returns that come back in
 
05:49:40.788 --> 05:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
Vermont I managed the Redemption system
 
05:49:42.750 --> 05:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
in Maine for about a quarter of the
 
05:49:44.670 --> 05:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
redemptions that come back there's an
 
05:49:46.548 --> 05:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
extraordinary amount of crossborder
 
05:49:48.990 --> 05:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
redemption that happens a lot of people
 
05:49:51.030 --> 05:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
in Vermont Massachusetts and Maine buy
 
05:49:53.628 --> 05:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
their beverages in New Hampshire and
 
05:49:55.230 --> 05:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
they take them home and they consume
 
05:49:58.070 --> 05:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
them and they bring them back here uh
 
05:49:59.788 --> 05:49:59.798 align:start position:0%
they bring them back to their to to
 
05:50:02.190 --> 05:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
their deposit states to get them to to
 
05:50:04.628 --> 05:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
get the refund um that means that
 
05:50:06.628 --> 05:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
consumers in New Hampshire sort
 
05:50:09.750 --> 05:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
of consumers outside the state you know
 
05:50:11.750 --> 05:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
have a 5cent disadvantage if they buy
 
05:50:13.948 --> 05:50:13.958 align:start position:0%
the product in state now we're talking
 
05:50:16.350 --> 05:50:16.360 align:start position:0%
about here just to be clear is New
 
05:50:18.830 --> 05:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would put itself at a five or
 
05:50:20.430 --> 05:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
10 cent disadvantage to those
 
05:50:22.948 --> 05:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
neighboring states reversing the flow of
 
05:50:25.868 --> 05:50:25.878 align:start position:0%
both sales which sends the sales outside
 
05:50:27.948 --> 05:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and reversing the flow
 
05:50:29.510 --> 05:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the rid redemptions which would bring
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
the redemptions into New Hampshire
 
05:50:33.788 --> 05:50:33.798 align:start position:0%
Connecticut has just gone to a 10cent
 
05:50:35.948 --> 05:50:35.958 align:start position:0%
refund value and is surrounded by New
 
05:50:38.110 --> 05:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
York and Massachusetts which have 5
 
05:50:41.350 --> 05:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
cents the lines on January 1st and 2nd
 
05:50:43.310 --> 05:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
at the redemption centers to get in to
 
05:50:45.270 --> 05:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
capitalize on that difference were you
 
05:50:47.390 --> 05:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
know extremely long people will do
 
05:50:50.750 --> 05:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
ridiculous things for 5 cents um we as
 
05:50:52.390 --> 05:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
as administrator of that system in
 
05:50:54.430 --> 05:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont we had to send a letter from the
 
05:50:55.948 --> 05:50:55.958 align:start position:0%
attorney general in Vermont several
 
05:50:57.628 --> 05:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
years ago to all of the New Hampshire
 
05:50:59.390 --> 05:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
border towns the Connecticut River
 
05:51:01.230 --> 05:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
Valley reminding them that it was
 
05:51:03.110 --> 05:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
illegal for them to collect bottles and
 
05:51:04.708 --> 05:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
cans at their transfer stations and
 
05:51:07.030 --> 05:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
bring them into Vermont for Redemption
 
05:51:08.708 --> 05:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
they're still doing it they just hire
 
05:51:10.310 --> 05:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
somebody to do it for them instead of
 
05:51:12.788 --> 05:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
doing it with Town trucks but it is a
 
05:51:16.708 --> 05:51:16.718 align:start position:0%
chronic problem um with that said um you
 
05:51:18.708 --> 05:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
know we are interested in policies that
 
05:51:20.430 --> 05:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
improve recycling we have invested in
 
05:51:22.030 --> 05:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's recycling system for
 
05:51:24.070 --> 05:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
decades through new hure the beautiful
 
05:51:26.830 --> 05:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
and directly through our companies um we
 
05:51:28.628 --> 05:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
are certainly open to discussions about
 
05:51:30.110 --> 05:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
better policies but we don't think this
 
05:51:35.310 --> 05:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:38.510 --> 05:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
you yes can you define New Hampshire the
 
05:51:41.590 --> 05:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
beautiful what what the nonprofit does
 
05:51:44.670 --> 05:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah my experience with New Hampshire
 
05:51:47.150 --> 05:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
the beautiful is it is an organization
 
05:51:49.830 --> 05:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
of retailers and beverage companies who
 
05:51:52.430 --> 05:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
voluntarily made contributions to a fund
 
05:51:54.548 --> 05:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
over the years who have paid for
 
05:51:56.708 --> 05:51:56.718 align:start position:0%
equipment at transfer stations signage
 
05:51:59.270 --> 05:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
at transfer stations um promotional
 
05:52:02.788 --> 05:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
education most importantly the bags the
 
05:52:06.830 --> 05:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
blue bags right bags so I know myself
 
05:52:08.910 --> 05:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
because I do for my town of rench I come
 
05:52:12.190 --> 05:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
up once a year to the resour here in in
 
05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
Epson and get our five bags or five
 
05:52:20.390 --> 05:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
boxes of you know 500 $100 500 bags and
 
05:52:24.070 --> 05:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
we use that for our Earth Day in ringe
 
05:52:25.830 --> 05:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
and which everybody goes out and picks
 
05:52:28.270 --> 05:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
up along the roadsides so when you see
 
05:52:30.310 --> 05:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
blue bags along the roadside which the
 
05:52:32.390 --> 05:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
state highway department picks them up
 
05:52:34.708 --> 05:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
but those are blue bags that they
 
05:52:37.430 --> 05:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
provide it's not a big
 
05:52:37.440 --> 05:52:41.030 align:start position:0%
provide it's not a big
deal

05:52:41.030 --> 05:52:41.040 align:start position:0%

testimony urging you to support passage
 
05:53:35.270 --> 05:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
of 1636 FN which would be of great
 
05:53:37.510 --> 05:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
economic benefit to New Hampshire
 
05:53:40.788 --> 05:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
residents I urge your support relative
 
05:53:42.750 --> 05:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
to creating the New Hampshire container
 
05:53:45.990 --> 05:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
deposit refund recycle and reuse system
 
05:53:48.868 --> 05:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of my Town's she is from
 
05:53:51.190 --> 05:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
Durham I'm a member of my Town's
 
05:53:53.230 --> 05:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
Integrated Waste Management advisory
 
05:53:55.070 --> 05:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
committee so I know firsthand the
 
05:53:57.430 --> 05:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
expenses of dealing with our residents
 
05:54:00.548 --> 05:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
waste even items that can be recycled
 
05:54:02.708 --> 05:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
such as beverage containers represent a
 
05:54:04.548 --> 05:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
cost when they are trucked to a
 
05:54:06.670 --> 05:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
recycling center in Massachusetts or
 
05:54:08.750 --> 05:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
when a resident has carelessly tossed
 
05:54:11.070 --> 05:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
them in with their solid waste and they
 
05:54:12.708 --> 05:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
must be trucked to the landfill where
 
05:54:15.430 --> 05:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
they're charged a tipping fee our
 
05:54:17.230 --> 05:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
residents pay these costs with their
 
05:54:19.510 --> 05:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
property taxes but the costs have been
 
05:54:21.910 --> 05:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
generated by beverage distributors who
 
05:54:23.910 --> 05:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
created the containers but have not paid
 
05:54:25.190 --> 05:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
for their
 
05:54:29.230 --> 05:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
disposal HB 1636 would hold beverage
 
05:54:31.708 --> 05:54:31.718 align:start position:0%

recycling these containers so they are
 
05:54:36.910 --> 05:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
not a cost burden for municipalities and
 
05:54:39.510 --> 05:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers we have examples of programs
 
05:54:42.270 --> 05:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
currently implemented in 10 states so we
 
05:54:44.788 --> 05:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
know that they work locations in the

system pays for itself with deposits
 
05:54:54.350 --> 05:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
that are not refunded meanwhile the

percentage of containers that are
 
05:54:58.910 --> 05:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
recycled can be expected to exceed
 
05:55:01.868 --> 05:55:01.878 align:start position:0%
85% as opposed to the average return
 
05:55:04.350 --> 05:55:04.360 align:start position:0%

recycled glass containers in particular
 
05:55:21.670 --> 05:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
can be upcycled because they are not

contaminated in a bottle return system
 
05:55:26.670 --> 05:55:26.680 align:start position:0%

reasons I urge you to support hb1 1636
 
05:55:45.590 --> 05:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
OTP ought to pass I view the bill as a
 
05:55:47.548 --> 05:55:47.558 align:start position:0%
win for all thank you for your
 
05:55:50.190 --> 05:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
consideration from Susan
 
05:55:52.868 --> 05:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
Richmond okay you did I'll take that you
 
05:55:54.948 --> 05:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
did I didn't get a copy okay yeah can we
 
05:55:56.230 --> 05:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
can we take that
 
05:55:58.830 --> 05:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
copy thank you
 
05:56:01.430 --> 05:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's thank you very
 
05:56:20.310 --> 05:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:23.590 --> 05:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
babber thanks again for taking this
 
05:56:23.600 --> 05:56:25.150 align:start position:0%
babber thanks again for taking this
testimony

05:56:25.150 --> 05:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:56:28.948 --> 05:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
today on the fourth Saturday of each
 
05:56:32.830 --> 05:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
month my husband and I join with other
 
05:56:37.990 --> 05:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
volunteers in the don't trash do group
 
05:56:42.150 --> 05:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
to pick up trash plastic bottles cans
 
05:56:45.628 --> 05:56:45.638 align:start position:0%
and other waste items in one area of our
 
05:56:48.628 --> 05:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
community so we we aren't doing it just
 
05:56:53.350 --> 05:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
on Earth Day we're doing it every month
 
05:56:57.468 --> 05:56:57.478 align:start position:0%
um for one hour and we use one hour
 
05:56:59.310 --> 05:56:59.320 align:start position:0%
because because it's easier for people
 
05:57:02.468 --> 05:57:02.478 align:start position:0%
to make commitments to that we pick up
 
05:57:05.670 --> 05:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
all the trash um all the
 
05:57:09.190 --> 05:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
recyclables that we can find and we have
 
05:57:13.990 --> 05:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
collected up to 14 to 15 huge of the
 
05:57:19.510 --> 05:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
blue bags um full in that period of time
 
05:57:21.590 --> 05:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
although over the years that we've been
 
05:57:21.600 --> 05:57:22.830 align:start position:0%
although over the years that we've been
doing

05:57:22.830 --> 05:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:57:26.150 --> 05:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
this the residential neighborhoods have
 
05:57:28.788 --> 05:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
shown a decrease in in litter it's
 
05:57:31.190 --> 05:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
really nice to go back to some of these
 
05:57:34.830 --> 05:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
areas and find that there's not a whole
 
05:57:36.310 --> 05:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
lot to pick
 
05:57:39.990 --> 05:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
up however in commercial areas and along
 
05:57:42.150 --> 05:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
the roads and highways there's a
 
05:57:45.070 --> 05:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of discarded waste a
 
05:57:48.750 --> 05:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
lot of this litter is made up of cans
 
05:57:52.910 --> 05:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
bottles and other containers and most of
 
05:57:57.830 --> 05:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
those are so dirty or so damaged that
 
05:58:01.868 --> 05:58:01.878 align:start position:0%
they are not appropriate to put into
 
05:58:05.548 --> 05:58:05.558 align:start position:0%
recycling according to bottle
 
05:58:09.190 --> 05:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
build.org beverage containers make up
 
05:58:11.070 --> 05:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
about 40 to
 
05:58:15.750 --> 05:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
60% of litter on our roads and
 
05:58:20.670 --> 05:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
highways um I went on the bottle Bill
 
05:58:23.868 --> 05:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
resource guide this morning I don't know
 
05:58:26.990 --> 05:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
if you've checked that out but it's it's
 
05:58:31.510 --> 05:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
worth looking at um and this is a
 
05:58:35.150 --> 05:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
project of the container recycling
 
05:58:40.510 --> 05:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
Institute on there they have a
 
05:58:43.910 --> 05:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
counter representing the number of
 
05:58:48.510 --> 05:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
Beverage cans and bottles that have been
 
05:58:53.030 --> 05:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
landfilled littered and incinerated in
 
05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
the US so far this
 
05:58:58.190 --> 05:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
year 20
 
05:59:01.990 --> 05:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
24 I started to write the number down so
 
05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
I could include it in my
 
05:59:08.670 --> 05:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
testimony it was moving so fast that I
 
05:59:13.030 --> 05:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
literally had to use my camera to take a
 
05:59:16.230 --> 05:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
photograph of the counter so I could
 
05:59:17.910 --> 05:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
write it
 
05:59:22.430 --> 05:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
down that number was 2
 
05:59:22.440 --> 05:59:25.830 align:start position:0%
down that number was 2
trillion

05:59:25.830 --> 05:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:30.948 --> 05:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:35.310 --> 05:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
88,000 26 containers and that was for
 
05:59:39.468 --> 05:59:39.478 align:start position:0%
like a millisecond before it moved on
 
05:59:46.468 --> 05:59:46.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:49.190 --> 05:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
9th HB
 
05:59:52.830 --> 05:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
1636 offers an opportunity to reduce
 
05:59:57.150 --> 05:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
trash and litter across New Hampshire 10
 
06:00:00.270 --> 06:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
state and Guam have similar container
 
06:00:03.270 --> 06:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
laws with Oregon being the first state
 
06:00:08.590 --> 06:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:12.708 --> 06:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
1971 so we've had a lot of time to try
 
06:00:15.468 --> 06:00:15.478 align:start position:0%
to think this through I I think it's
 
06:00:17.708 --> 06:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
unfortunate with so many people that
 
06:00:22.030 --> 06:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
seem to embrace the basic idea the basic
 
06:00:24.590 --> 06:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
concept that the
 
06:00:28.468 --> 06:00:28.478 align:start position:0%
industry and the leader leadership in
 
06:00:31.390 --> 06:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
our state can't figure out a way to work
 
06:00:36.110 --> 06:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:42.070 --> 06:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
issue Oregon's Redemption rate now
 
06:00:47.230 --> 06:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
Oregon has a container deposit bill so
 
06:00:51.868 --> 06:00:51.878 align:start position:0%
Oregon's Redemption rate in
 
06:00:56.030 --> 06:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:58.708 --> 06:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
86% and do you remember what
 
06:01:02.390 --> 06:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative Duty said New Hampshire's
 
06:01:07.948 --> 06:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:15.270 --> 06:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:18.910 --> 06:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
78% so it it seems
 
06:01:25.070 --> 06:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
clear that having a bill like this would
 
06:01:29.468 --> 06:01:29.478 align:start position:0%
increase the capture of these
 
06:01:32.910 --> 06:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
containers and they then could be
 
06:01:37.510 --> 06:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
handled appropriately and hopefully um
 
06:01:40.670 --> 06:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
reused the current system of handling
 
06:01:44.230 --> 06:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
bottles and cans in New Hampshire is one
 
06:01:47.788 --> 06:01:47.798 align:start position:0%
that puts the responsibility on
 
06:01:50.030 --> 06:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
residents and
 
06:01:52.230 --> 06:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities I expect you know we
 
06:01:54.390 --> 06:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
could ask other people in this room and
 
06:01:56.548 --> 06:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
we would find others that go around
 
06:02:00.030 --> 06:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
their community and pick up these
 
06:02:05.110 --> 06:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
things so it is our responsibility then
 
06:02:08.430 --> 06:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
to try to get the containers recycled or
 
06:02:11.628 --> 06:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
to spend time and energy picking up and
 
06:02:14.670 --> 06:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with the litter and filling our
 
06:02:17.628 --> 06:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
landfills traditionally the
 
06:02:21.030 --> 06:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and beverage Industries
 
06:02:25.430 --> 06:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
has opposed changing this and some even
 
06:02:27.948 --> 06:02:27.958 align:start position:0%
claimed that consumers found found
 
06:02:32.350 --> 06:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:35.548 --> 06:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
inconvenient however Susan Collins of
 
06:02:40.150 --> 06:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
the container recycling Institute told
 
06:02:44.070 --> 06:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
NPR when there's a poll done in any of
 
06:02:47.670 --> 06:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
the states that have existing deposit
 
06:02:52.468 --> 06:02:52.478 align:start position:0%
laws we've seen support between
 
06:02:56.270 --> 06:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
70% all the way up to
 
06:03:02.150 --> 06:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
95% in I think Vermont and um one of our
 
06:03:06.310 --> 06:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
previous testifiers may be able to um
 
06:03:09.590 --> 06:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
verify that so much so these numbers
 
06:03:12.830 --> 06:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
were so high that the pollsters had to
 
06:03:15.708 --> 06:03:15.718 align:start position:0%
double check their numbers because they
 
06:03:18.150 --> 06:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
didn't believe what they were
 
06:03:22.350 --> 06:03:22.360 align:start position:0%
seeing once a program is in place
 
06:03:25.830 --> 06:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
they're popular with
 
06:03:29.628 --> 06:03:29.638 align:start position:0%
consumers like more than motherhood and
 
06:03:32.230 --> 06:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
apple pie Susan Collins
 
06:03:36.030 --> 06:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
says so let's do what's best for New
 
06:03:39.110 --> 06:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and our environment
 
06:03:42.350 --> 06:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote ought to pass on this
 
06:03:45.350 --> 06:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:48.070 --> 06:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
you okay any
 
06:03:50.510 --> 06:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very
 
06:03:56.190 --> 06:03:56.200 align:start position:0%

in my name is Bruce bar from the town in

Pittsfield I'm not going to deliver my
 
06:04:10.270 --> 06:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
prepared remarks because uh it is
 
06:04:12.030 --> 06:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
running so late and we have a really
 
06:04:13.270 --> 06:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
important bill that needs to be
 
06:04:15.830 --> 06:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
discussed today which is p i I would
 
06:04:18.590 --> 06:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
just say two things maybe three speakers
 
06:04:21.670 --> 06:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
ago somebody gave an articulate uh
 
06:04:23.430 --> 06:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
position why this bill should not go
 
06:04:25.670 --> 06:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
through clearly well informed I would
 
06:04:27.468 --> 06:04:27.478 align:start position:0%
ask her to be on the committee or the
 
06:04:29.868 --> 06:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to help us pass a bill that
 
06:04:32.708 --> 06:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
she thinks is manageable that seems
 
06:04:34.990 --> 06:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
common sense to me the second thing I
 
06:04:37.590 --> 06:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
would say is I don't think these bills
 
06:04:39.070 --> 06:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
are necessarily going to pass today but
 
06:04:41.030 --> 06:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
I would ask the commit I would ask this
 
06:04:43.390 --> 06:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
committee to honor them enough to take
 
06:04:47.030 --> 06:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
them into a subcommittee to study them
 
06:04:48.788 --> 06:04:48.798 align:start position:0%
because we have a plastic problem we all
 
06:04:50.830 --> 06:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
know that I'll give you one fun fact and
 
06:04:53.910 --> 06:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
I'm done uh plastic bottles supposedly
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
take about 450 years to completely
 
06:04:59.150 --> 06:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
decompose so when the pilgrims came in
 
06:05:01.230 --> 06:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
1620 and they dropped their plastic
 
06:05:03.708 --> 06:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
bottles at Plymouth they still haven't
 
06:05:06.430 --> 06:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
completely decomposed thank
 
06:05:08.868 --> 06:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
you uh just for everyone's uh
 
06:05:10.390 --> 06:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
edification this is the Commerce
 
06:05:13.430 --> 06:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
Committee and and I as the chair have
 
06:05:16.468 --> 06:05:16.478 align:start position:0%
traditionally always had a subcommittee
 
06:05:19.830 --> 06:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
on all bills in this committee and which
 
06:05:24.910 --> 06:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:28.868 --> 06:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
subcommittee Heidi
 
06:05:34.590 --> 06:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:36.868 --> 06:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
Foundation good afternoon again good
 
06:05:38.350 --> 06:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon Heidi trarco with the
 
06:05:39.910 --> 06:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
conservation law Foundation we have
 
06:05:41.628 --> 06:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
written comments and so I will submit
 
06:05:45.190 --> 06:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
those um and not get into um too much
 
06:05:47.708 --> 06:05:47.718 align:start position:0%
detail but I we are here to urge the
 
06:05:49.628 --> 06:05:49.638 align:start position:0%
committee to vote ought to pass on the
 
06:05:52.230 --> 06:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
bottle bill and when I was here earlier
 
06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
today I spoke about this legislature's
 
06:05:57.590 --> 06:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
waste reduction and diversion goal
 
06:05:59.350 --> 06:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
and just to remind the committee you
 
06:06:02.190 --> 06:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
know that is we are as a state are to be
 
06:06:05.708 --> 06:06:05.718 align:start position:0%
reducing our waste by 25% by 2030 and
 
06:06:07.628 --> 06:06:07.638 align:start position:0%
45% by
 
06:06:10.270 --> 06:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
2050 it has to come from somewhere
 
06:06:12.110 --> 06:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
something has to be reduced is it single
 
06:06:13.830 --> 06:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
use plastic are we going to be recycling
 
06:06:16.390 --> 06:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
our bottles and so in addition to those
 
06:06:18.788 --> 06:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
waste reduction goals we have the waste
 
06:06:21.590 --> 06:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
management hierarchy also established by
 
06:06:23.948 --> 06:06:23.958 align:start position:0%
the legislature and reinforced by Dees
 
06:06:25.708 --> 06:06:25.718 align:start position:0%
in the latest Solid Waste Management
 
06:06:27.990 --> 06:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
plan and this bottle bill would fall in
 
06:06:30.110 --> 06:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
that hierarchy second which is Recycling
 
06:06:31.910 --> 06:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
and reuse so the bill before should be
 
06:06:34.310 --> 06:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
the top priority this would be the next
 
06:06:35.990 --> 06:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
approach to managing our waste in a
 
06:06:38.628 --> 06:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
responsible way um and I'm going to
 
06:06:40.628 --> 06:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
provide Our Testimony which has a lot of
 
06:06:43.468 --> 06:06:43.478 align:start position:0%
citations to where bottle bills have
 
06:06:45.350 --> 06:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
been implemented successfully in the
 
06:06:46.910 --> 06:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
past and there is some data here you
 
06:06:50.070 --> 06:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
know showing how it vastly increases
 
06:06:52.910 --> 06:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
recycling vastly reduces litter um I
 
06:06:54.350 --> 06:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
think a lot of times we talk about the
 
06:06:56.510 --> 06:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
increase in recycling but the reduce in
 
06:06:58.270 --> 06:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
litter there's numbers that say litter
 
06:07:02.030 --> 06:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
is reduced from 70 to 84% that is a huge
 
06:07:05.708 --> 06:07:05.718 align:start position:0%
number um and saves municipalities money
 
06:07:07.230 --> 06:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I'd like I'm so
 
06:07:08.548 --> 06:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
happy that people brought this up
 
06:07:11.270 --> 06:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
earlier you know just to remember that
 
06:07:14.150 --> 06:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
there is a cost in these bottles not
 
06:07:17.468 --> 06:07:17.478 align:start position:0%
being recycled we are when we keep they
 
06:07:18.868 --> 06:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
you know as we all know when we put them
 
06:07:21.230 --> 06:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
in the trash they don't go away they sit
 
06:07:22.948 --> 06:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
in our landfills we have limited
 
06:07:25.190 --> 06:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
resources for those landfills they sit
 
06:07:27.150 --> 06:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
there and they are there forever so
 
06:07:28.990 --> 06:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
let's make some smart decisions and
 
06:07:31.150 --> 06:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
recycle what we can and we know that
 
06:07:34.030 --> 06:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
bottle bills work and it's really proven
 
06:07:36.868 --> 06:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
technology um and similarly I have very
 
06:07:38.430 --> 06:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
fond memories of being a teenager and
 
06:07:39.708 --> 06:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
collecting lots of bottles in
 
06:07:42.070 --> 06:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and taking them in uh
 
06:07:44.548 --> 06:07:44.558 align:start position:0%
nothing incentivizes a kid or a teenager
 
06:07:46.548 --> 06:07:46.558 align:start position:0%
more than 10 cents or 15 cents you
 
06:07:48.510 --> 06:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
collect them all and um take them to the
 
06:07:51.150 --> 06:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
grocery store and get some money back so
 
06:07:53.190 --> 06:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
um it worked for me and I think it can
 
06:07:54.948 --> 06:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
work for the rest of New Hampshire so we
 
06:07:57.190 --> 06:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to vote a to pass
 
06:08:00.628 --> 06:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
thank you yes this is just a what
 
06:08:02.590 --> 06:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
jubile city of
 
06:08:06.948 --> 06:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
Manchester burns the recycling they burn
 
06:08:08.670 --> 06:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
their recycling we have recycling bins
 
06:08:10.468 --> 06:08:10.478 align:start position:0%
they're blue we put all our recyclables
 
06:08:14.350 --> 06:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
in there they pick it up I don't know if
 
06:08:17.548 --> 06:08:17.558 align:start position:0%
it's um I don't know where they bring it
 
06:08:19.350 --> 06:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
but it they burn
 
06:08:23.150 --> 06:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
it which is yes incineration is not a
 
06:08:26.510 --> 06:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
solution no we have a waste problem we
 
06:08:29.310 --> 06:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
need alternatives to land filling our
 
06:08:32.590 --> 06:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
waste and burning our waste and the the
 
06:08:34.830 --> 06:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
top tier alternatives are to reduce the
 
06:08:36.830 --> 06:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
waste that we're creating and then to
 
06:08:39.510 --> 06:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
recycle what we can and uh some of the
 
06:08:41.350 --> 06:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
easiest things to recycle are aluminum
 
06:08:44.190 --> 06:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
and glass and so let's start there let's
 
06:08:45.548 --> 06:08:45.558 align:start position:0%
adopt this technology that's been
 
06:08:48.990 --> 06:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
happening in other states for decades um
 
06:08:50.788 --> 06:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
and and move
 
06:08:53.948 --> 06:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
forward thank you thank you uh one last
 
06:08:53.958 --> 06:08:54.868 align:start position:0%
forward thank you thank you uh one last
card

06:08:54.868 --> 06:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
card
 
06:09:03.510 --> 06:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:03.520 --> 06:09:10.830 align:start position:0%
 
Walter

06:09:10.830 --> 06:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:14.868 --> 06:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
Walter more more R uh yeah so I don't
 
06:09:17.310 --> 06:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
want to thank you so much for staying
 
06:09:19.788 --> 06:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
here and being here at all and taking
 
06:09:21.190 --> 06:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
this testimony I will try to make it
 
06:09:24.110 --> 06:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
even shorter um to avoid repeats U I
 
06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
want to make a couple points first of
 
06:09:30.708 --> 06:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
all that that there is a huge quality
 
06:09:34.390 --> 06:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
difference and income and opportunities
 
06:09:37.750 --> 06:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
for more New Hampshire businesses when
 
06:09:41.468 --> 06:09:41.478 align:start position:0%
this can goes into a Redemption Center
 
06:09:44.070 --> 06:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire which it does not now
 
06:09:47.110 --> 06:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
because we don't have them this can can
 
06:09:50.670 --> 06:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
then be the Recycled reused in
 
06:09:52.948 --> 06:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
definitely as you've heard but I want to
 
06:09:55.390 --> 06:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
emphasize the importance of new
 
06:09:58.030 --> 06:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
businesses for New Hampshire in taking
 
06:10:02.990 --> 06:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
these high quality perfectly clean um um
 
06:10:06.910 --> 06:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
um aluminum cans we try in New in in my
 
06:10:09.628 --> 06:10:09.638 align:start position:0%
city to put these cans in these bins but
 
06:10:12.510 --> 06:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
they don't stay there they they move all
 
06:10:14.670 --> 06:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
Al of places because they're so
 
06:10:16.990 --> 06:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
lightweight and so they end up being
 
06:10:18.830 --> 06:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
wasted and they end up being collected
 
06:10:21.110 --> 06:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
by you know people who run around
 
06:10:22.430 --> 06:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
collecting them and then they end up
 
06:10:26.670 --> 06:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
being put into the trash this plastic um
 
06:10:29.990 --> 06:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
can also have that same negative fate I
 
06:10:32.468 --> 06:10:32.478 align:start position:0%
don't have a third bottle of glass but
 
06:10:36.030 --> 06:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
again that glass reuse in my town we
 
06:10:39.070 --> 06:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
used to collect the glass and reuse it
 
06:10:42.910 --> 06:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
in in our um in our city uh uh sidewalk
 
06:10:45.548 --> 06:10:45.558 align:start position:0%
committee they're all glitering all our
 
06:10:48.110 --> 06:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
sidewalks are glittering with old glass
 
06:10:52.190 --> 06:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
from the 1950s and so on it's beautiful
 
06:10:55.708 --> 06:10:55.718 align:start position:0%
but there's no business to do that now
 
06:10:58.788 --> 06:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
we can have that business back in my
 
06:11:02.310 --> 06:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
town with those new jobs if we that
 
06:11:05.390 --> 06:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
glass doesn't get messed up with all the
 
06:11:07.628 --> 06:11:07.638 align:start position:0%
mixed use stuff but instead it goes
 
06:11:10.110 --> 06:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
there I want you to see the business
 
06:11:13.590 --> 06:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities with this program and I
 
06:11:16.350 --> 06:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
also want you to understand that it was
 
06:11:17.750 --> 06:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
because of the fine print and the
 
06:11:20.230 --> 06:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
complexity of the bill perhaps you
 
06:11:22.190 --> 06:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
didn't understand that the
 
06:11:26.510 --> 06:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
pr is not locked into as many strict
 
06:11:28.868 --> 06:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
ures that might have been described by a
 
06:11:31.910 --> 06:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
previous opponent to the bill um perhaps
 
06:11:33.110 --> 06:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
we again this the kind of thing that
 
06:11:35.708 --> 06:11:35.718 align:start position:0%
needs to get worked out in subcommittees
 
06:11:38.548 --> 06:11:38.558 align:start position:0%
or or any other structures you have that
 
06:11:40.948 --> 06:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
the pr can have a good amount of
 
06:11:45.670 --> 06:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be um um in Innovative in
 
06:11:49.190 --> 06:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
keeping New Hampshire beautiful and
 
06:11:52.830 --> 06:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
economically growing with new businesses
 
06:11:55.070 --> 06:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
um the last thing I wanted to mention is
 
06:11:58.150 --> 06:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
please remember this is Revenue neutral
 
06:12:01.548 --> 06:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
on the big scale and remember that the
 
06:12:03.948 --> 06:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
evidence from these Decades of other
 
06:12:06.070 --> 06:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
states show
 
06:12:10.430 --> 06:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
that there is no cost impact on prices I
 
06:12:12.830 --> 06:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
so much appreciate that that you the
 
06:12:15.750 --> 06:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
chair are concerned about us charging
 
06:12:17.670 --> 06:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
more and more for bottles and cans and
 
06:12:20.070 --> 06:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
so forth if we have this system I
 
06:12:22.270 --> 06:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that concern but if you
 
06:12:24.310 --> 06:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
actually look at the actual numbers
 
06:12:25.708 --> 06:12:25.718 align:start position:0%
which you haven't had time to do I'm
 
06:12:28.030 --> 06:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
sure but those numbers have been
 
06:12:30.948 --> 06:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
examined and there will be no impact on
 
06:12:34.708 --> 06:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
this because these companies want to be
 
06:12:36.868 --> 06:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
competitive and they're not going to
 
06:12:39.990 --> 06:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
dump the 10 cents on us um they're going
 
06:12:43.070 --> 06:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
to keep their products affordable um and
 
06:12:45.670 --> 06:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
therefore um it's it's it's not a it's
 
06:12:48.310 --> 06:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
not a danger so thank you again for your
 
06:12:50.990 --> 06:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
concerns and uh um and I hope we can
 
06:12:54.830 --> 06:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
move forward to uh to save waste thank
 
06:12:56.868 --> 06:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
06:12:59.190 --> 06:12:59.200 align:start position:0%

work that you've already done on the

carpets spill uh we learned a lot
 
06:16:33.788 --> 06:16:33.798 align:start position:0%
through that process and I'm extremely
 
06:16:35.548 --> 06:16:35.558 align:start position:0%
pleased to bring before the committee
 
06:16:39.230 --> 06:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
today a new broader fully bipartisan
 
06:16:43.510 --> 06:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
bill on P added products as you can tell
 
06:16:45.990 --> 06:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
from the sponsors and I want to start
 
06:16:48.468 --> 06:16:48.478 align:start position:0%
out by saying that this bill is really
 
06:16:50.868 --> 06:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
unlike most bills that you're likely to
 
06:16:54.830 --> 06:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
see before you there are a few things
 
06:16:57.030 --> 06:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
that would Unite the solid waste
 
06:17:00.430 --> 06:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
industry the wastewater treatment folks
 
06:17:02.510 --> 06:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
drinking water
 
06:17:05.510 --> 06:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities Public Health officials
 
06:17:09.150 --> 06:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
environmental Advocates and our citizens
 
06:17:11.910 --> 06:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
to speak with one voice I don't think
 
06:17:14.910 --> 06:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see that very often P
 
06:17:18.150 --> 06:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
contamination is a huge problem P should
 
06:17:20.350 --> 06:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
not be in the air we breathe the water
 
06:17:23.270 --> 06:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
we drink or the soil we walk on it
 
06:17:24.590 --> 06:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in the blood of our
 
06:17:26.670 --> 06:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
children our grandchildren
 
06:17:30.270 --> 06:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
our parents or in us I feel quite
 
06:17:32.150 --> 06:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
confident in saying that every single
 
06:17:35.070 --> 06:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
one of us as we sit here today have a
 
06:17:38.230 --> 06:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
cocktail of past chemicals variously
 
06:17:41.628 --> 06:17:41.638 align:start position:0%
constructed in our bodies as we in New
 
06:17:44.110 --> 06:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the US and globally
 
06:17:47.150 --> 06:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
struggle to understand the magnitude of
 
06:17:50.270 --> 06:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
an attempt to mitigate this problem the
 
06:17:53.708 --> 06:17:53.718 align:start position:0%
answer is really pretty clear we have to
 
06:17:57.510 --> 06:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
stop using products with P it's really
 
06:17:57.520 --> 06:17:58.750 align:start position:0%
stop using products with P it's really
that

06:17:58.750 --> 06:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:18:01.510 --> 06:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
simple I would not want to sit here and
 
06:18:04.510 --> 06:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
tell you that we should continue to
 
06:18:08.468 --> 06:18:08.478 align:start position:0%
allow uh past products to be consumed
 
06:18:10.270 --> 06:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
because I think that is not really
 
06:18:13.270 --> 06:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
hearing what people want
 
06:18:16.350 --> 06:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
today as we start the hearings I really
 
06:18:19.030 --> 06:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
and I I realize it's a late hour but I
 
06:18:22.390 --> 06:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
really can't um speak about this without
 
06:18:24.230 --> 06:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
talking about the people who have
 
06:18:27.150 --> 06:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
battled this before in our our state I
 
06:18:29.310 --> 06:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
really ad admire them for the work
 
06:18:31.350 --> 06:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
they've done and it's really been a
 
06:18:34.190 --> 06:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
privilege for me to uh participate with
 
06:18:36.990 --> 06:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
them in this uh battle and build on
 
06:18:39.430 --> 06:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
their efforts I don't have a written
 
06:18:41.548 --> 06:18:41.558 align:start position:0%
statement to share today but I did
 
06:18:43.788 --> 06:18:43.798 align:start position:0%
provide the committee with informational
 
06:18:46.628 --> 06:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
packets and I really uh thought it would
 
06:18:49.030 --> 06:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
be helpful if I kind of talked about
 
06:18:52.030 --> 06:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
this and walked through them to start
 
06:18:54.510 --> 06:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
with I have to say that I come here
 
06:18:56.948 --> 06:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
today as the chair of the state's
 
06:18:59.708 --> 06:18:59.718 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group on solid waste the
 
06:19:02.510 --> 06:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group and we
 
06:19:05.310 --> 06:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
represent all facets of solid waste and
 
06:19:08.708 --> 06:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
the solid waste IND industry its repre
 
06:19:11.150 --> 06:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative membership is Broad from
 
06:19:13.830 --> 06:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
landfill owners operators to
 
06:19:15.548 --> 06:19:15.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities construction and
 
06:19:18.390 --> 06:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
demolition debris handlers a waste to
 
06:19:21.468 --> 06:19:21.478 align:start position:0%
energy plant and hospitals to M name a
 
06:19:24.230 --> 06:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
few and its responsibilities include
 
06:19:26.390 --> 06:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
bringing forth legislation to further
 
06:19:28.708 --> 06:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
the goals of our recently adopted Solid
 
06:19:32.190 --> 06:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
Waste Management plan one major goal is
 
06:19:35.150 --> 06:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
the reduction of toxicity in our waist
 
06:19:38.590 --> 06:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
stream our support of that goal led to
 
06:19:41.708 --> 06:19:41.718 align:start position:0%
that bill this bill so it's important to
 
06:19:44.350 --> 06:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
understand where the bill originated and
 
06:19:48.070 --> 06:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's out of very real tangible concerns
 
06:19:50.270 --> 06:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
of the broader stakeholder group on
 
06:19:52.708 --> 06:19:52.718 align:start position:0%
behalf of our state and in furtherance
 
06:19:54.350 --> 06:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
06:19:57.430 --> 06:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
plan one of the most important things to
 
06:19:58.990 --> 06:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
understand today as we start the
 
06:20:01.548 --> 06:20:01.558 align:start position:0%
discussion is the interrelationship of
 
06:20:05.390 --> 06:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
our solid waste and Wastewater systems
 
06:20:08.270 --> 06:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
and the graphic that I have shown that I
 
06:20:11.150 --> 06:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
brought here for you really tells the
 
06:20:13.708 --> 06:20:13.718 align:start position:0%
tale and I won't take a whole lot of
 
06:20:16.390 --> 06:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
time explaining it but what I want you
 
06:20:20.670 --> 06:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
to see is that um what goes into the
 
06:20:23.270 --> 06:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
landfill comes from and the and the
 
06:20:25.990 --> 06:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
title as you see is past sources what
 
06:20:28.910 --> 06:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
goes into the landfill comes from
 
06:20:32.868 --> 06:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
industry and it also comes from us it
 
06:20:35.990 --> 06:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
goes into the landfill the landfill has
 
06:20:37.990 --> 06:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
leachate that comes out of it just
 
06:20:40.670 --> 06:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
because of rain and some decomposition
 
06:20:42.910 --> 06:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
the lee8 then has to go to the
 
06:20:45.150 --> 06:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant at the
 
06:20:49.110 --> 06:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant you also have
 
06:20:52.990 --> 06:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh sewer um you know water you have
 
06:20:56.190 --> 06:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
septage from our own uh tanks
 
06:21:00.350 --> 06:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
and you have uh water from industry they
 
06:21:02.990 --> 06:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
process that and what comes out of the
 
06:21:05.868 --> 06:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants stay with me
 
06:21:07.590 --> 06:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
on this is
 
06:21:10.788 --> 06:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
sludge and sludge much of what comes out
 
06:21:13.468 --> 06:21:13.478 align:start position:0%
of the sludge include I mean is included
 
06:21:16.788 --> 06:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
with the sludge is p some of the sludge
 
06:21:18.910 --> 06:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
is turned into biosolids which is
 
06:21:24.150 --> 06:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
treated and can be um uh put out on soil
 
06:21:28.310 --> 06:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
but the sludge with the pasas uh to the
 
06:21:30.750 --> 06:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
extent that it gets it goes back into
 
06:21:33.910 --> 06:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
the landfill again so you've got the
 
06:21:37.468 --> 06:21:37.478 align:start position:0%
trash the landfill the leachate the
 
06:21:40.430 --> 06:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant the sludge
 
06:21:42.628 --> 06:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
back to the landfill again but in
 
06:21:45.110 --> 06:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
addition wastewater treatment plants
 
06:21:48.548 --> 06:21:48.558 align:start position:0%
release water to surface waters and at
 
06:21:51.230 --> 06:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
this point it's not really being tested
 
06:21:55.350 --> 06:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
for p but the requirement for p testing
 
06:21:57.910 --> 06:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
is probably coming very soon and this is
 
06:22:01.948 --> 06:22:01.958 align:start position:0%
going to be really expensive for um our
 
06:22:04.628 --> 06:22:04.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities the other issue here of
 
06:22:07.548 --> 06:22:07.558 align:start position:0%
course is drinking water and drinking
 
06:22:10.510 --> 06:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
water is taken from ground and surface
 
06:22:13.548 --> 06:22:13.558 align:start position:0%
waters and it's processed and it's being
 
06:22:17.910 --> 06:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
tested to uh very very minuscule levels
 
06:22:20.788 --> 06:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
for peace fast at Great expense and
 
06:22:23.150 --> 06:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
being filtered and then something has to
 
06:22:26.310 --> 06:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
happen with the filter and many of these
 
06:22:28.628 --> 06:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
filters also can end up in the
 
06:22:30.708 --> 06:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
landfill and then you know it rains
 
06:22:32.948 --> 06:22:32.958 align:start position:0%
again and then there's Le so it's all
 
06:22:35.750 --> 06:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
really interrelated and I think that's
 
06:22:38.788 --> 06:22:38.798 align:start position:0%
why um when I come before you today and
 
06:22:40.510 --> 06:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
you probably haven't had a chance to
 
06:22:43.030 --> 06:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
read your emails but I have support
 
06:22:44.948 --> 06:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
letters from the wastewater treatment
 
06:22:48.030 --> 06:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
plants drinking water
 
06:22:50.150 --> 06:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and public health
 
06:22:52.390 --> 06:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
officials they're all really interested
 
06:22:55.788 --> 06:22:55.798 align:start position:0%
in this um subject there's a letter of
 
06:22:58.350 --> 06:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
support here from the New Hampshire
 
06:23:00.830 --> 06:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
Water Pollution Control Association the
 
06:23:03.628 --> 06:23:03.638 align:start position:0%
granted State Rural Water Association
 
06:23:06.548 --> 06:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire Waterworks Association
 
06:23:10.070 --> 06:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
they bear a huge burden and it all comes
 
06:23:13.750 --> 06:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
back eventually on the on the taxpayers
 
06:23:16.510 --> 06:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
um from the solid waste folks we're uh
 
06:23:18.468 --> 06:23:18.478 align:start position:0%
anticipating a national waste and
 
06:23:21.708 --> 06:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
recycling Association letter that's the
 
06:23:24.468 --> 06:23:24.478 align:start position:0%
national uh Solid Waste trade
 
06:23:26.910 --> 06:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
Association and I'm looking forward to
 
06:23:30.910 --> 06:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
receiving that letter um soon uh so the
 
06:23:33.430 --> 06:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
next thing I want to talk about is money
 
06:23:35.788 --> 06:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
in your packet you'll find an argu uh
 
06:23:38.468 --> 06:23:38.478 align:start position:0%
article that summarizes the results of
 
06:23:41.270 --> 06:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
the uh Minnesota pollution and
 
06:23:46.030 --> 06:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
environmental um control agency that
 
06:23:49.548 --> 06:23:49.558 align:start position:0%
analyzes um Minnesota as far as
 
06:23:52.110 --> 06:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
remediation costs and the numbers really
 
06:23:52.120 --> 06:23:53.670 align:start position:0%
remediation costs and the numbers really
are

06:23:53.670 --> 06:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:23:57.948 --> 06:23:57.958 align:start position:0%
breathtaking um they estimated that for
 
06:24:01.350 --> 06:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
every one pound of past that's purchased
 
06:24:05.670 --> 06:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
it can for 15 to ,000 it can cost $2.7
 
06:24:09.830 --> 06:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
to18 million to mitigate the effects
 
06:24:12.110 --> 06:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
under you know circumstances when it
 
06:24:14.868 --> 06:24:14.878 align:start position:0%
gets into the environment and they also
 
06:24:17.868 --> 06:24:17.878 align:start position:0%
estimated just looking at Wastewater and
 
06:24:22.590 --> 06:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
biosolids 14 billion to 28 billion
 
06:24:26.190 --> 06:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
dollar over 20 years to remediate p F
 
06:24:28.350 --> 06:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
that's the estimate that that you know
 
06:24:31.110 --> 06:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
their government um put together and
 
06:24:33.190 --> 06:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's described in the article that I
 
06:24:36.030 --> 06:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
gave you um as everyone knows there's no
 
06:24:38.430 --> 06:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
real accepted affordable method yet on
 
06:24:41.990 --> 06:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
how to destroy P once it's out in the
 
06:24:45.788 --> 06:24:45.798 align:start position:0%
wild um you can look at it later but I
 
06:24:49.030 --> 06:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to go back to our own LBA and
 
06:24:51.390 --> 06:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
talk to them about how much State money
 
06:24:54.230 --> 06:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
has been expended what I have for you
 
06:24:56.948 --> 06:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
there is a summary of the Pas um
 
06:25:01.190 --> 06:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
response fund it's about $75 million
 
06:25:03.468 --> 06:25:03.478 align:start position:0%
there's other related costs that aren't
 
06:25:06.030 --> 06:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
included in that but I think it's safe
 
06:25:08.628 --> 06:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
to say that the state has probably got
 
06:25:11.430 --> 06:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
around hundred million do into
 
06:25:15.350 --> 06:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
this who knows how much municipalities
 
06:25:17.310 --> 06:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
and wastewater treatment and drinking
 
06:25:19.628 --> 06:25:19.638 align:start position:0%
water treatment facilities have already
 
06:25:22.350 --> 06:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
expended on this so when you're thinking
 
06:25:27.230 --> 06:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
about the cost maybe to the A agency um
 
06:25:30.030 --> 06:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
of something like this it's just really
 
06:25:32.430 --> 06:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
important to keep these numbers in
 
06:25:35.948 --> 06:25:35.958 align:start position:0%
mind um I also gave to you if the
 
06:25:40.390 --> 06:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
copying got done a picture of the USGS
 
06:25:44.110 --> 06:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:46.910 --> 06:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
map that shows that every single place
 
06:25:49.468 --> 06:25:49.478 align:start position:0%
they tested for past they found it in
 
06:25:49.478 --> 06:25:50.990 align:start position:0%
they tested for past they found it in
the

06:25:50.990 --> 06:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:25:55.628 --> 06:25:55.638 align:start position:0%
state um I so that just showed the
 
06:25:55.638 --> 06:25:56.788 align:start position:0%
state um I so that just showed the
widespread

06:25:56.788 --> 06:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
widespread
 
06:25:59.030 --> 06:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
contamination um I don't have a map of
 
06:26:01.590 --> 06:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
it here but there's also a past water
 
06:26:03.948 --> 06:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
sampling map that map that's available
 
06:26:07.830 --> 06:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
on the dees website again the spread of
 
06:26:10.708 --> 06:26:10.718 align:start position:0%
the stuff is absolutely
 
06:26:13.910 --> 06:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
breathtaking um I also have given you a
 
06:26:17.390 --> 06:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
p fact sheet that was prepared by Dees
 
06:26:19.868 --> 06:26:19.878 align:start position:0%
that tells you an awful lot about the
 
06:26:23.670 --> 06:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
circularity of the of the P um getting
 
06:26:26.468 --> 06:26:26.478 align:start position:0%
into our system how to avoid it and how
 
06:26:28.548 --> 06:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
it affects
 
06:26:28.558 --> 06:26:30.150 align:start position:0%
it affects
us

06:26:30.150 --> 06:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:26:33.310 --> 06:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
um I am not going to talk a lot about
 
06:26:36.190 --> 06:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
the health effects today they obviously
 
06:26:39.430 --> 06:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
are very real and very concerning um
 
06:26:41.310 --> 06:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
there are other people here that can
 
06:26:43.670 --> 06:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
speak more intelligently about that and
 
06:26:46.190 --> 06:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
also in the interest of time I thought
 
06:26:48.310 --> 06:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
that I wouldn't go into that I hope you
 
06:26:51.270 --> 06:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
have all seen an excellent letter that
 
06:26:54.788 --> 06:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
was prepared um by Dr Romano from the
 
06:26:58.190 --> 06:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
dart Geisel Su um school of medicine
 
06:27:00.750 --> 06:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
she's an environmental epidemiologist
 
06:27:02.948 --> 06:27:02.958 align:start position:0%
she's being doing she's done studies on
 
06:27:06.868 --> 06:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
past and health issues um and it's
 
06:27:06.878 --> 06:27:07.990 align:start position:0%
past and health issues um and it's
really

06:27:07.990 --> 06:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:27:10.190 --> 06:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
elucidating there's also a letter and I
 
06:27:11.948 --> 06:27:11.958 align:start position:0%
don't want to steal her Thunder but we
 
06:27:13.670 --> 06:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
also have something here from the New
 
06:27:16.590 --> 06:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Health Association um
 
06:27:18.628 --> 06:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
in support of the
 
06:27:23.150 --> 06:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
bill so um we can talk about the bill um
 
06:27:25.230 --> 06:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
I'll just kind of give the highlights
 
06:27:27.230 --> 06:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
because I'm anticipating that this is
 
06:27:29.030 --> 06:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
probably going to go to a
 
06:27:32.270 --> 06:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but as I said uh based on
 
06:27:34.910 --> 06:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
all the incontrovertible facts that I
 
06:27:36.948 --> 06:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
have just been talking about we come to
 
06:27:39.948 --> 06:27:39.958 align:start position:0%
one conclusion we need to stop the
 
06:27:42.390 --> 06:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
influx of these chemicals in the first
 
06:27:44.670 --> 06:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
place I think a lot of us aren't really
 
06:27:47.230 --> 06:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
used to thinking about this issue in
 
06:27:50.110 --> 06:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
this way because we're we're focused on
 
06:27:52.390 --> 06:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
testing limits and
 
06:27:54.708 --> 06:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
Remediation but if we really want to
 
06:27:57.270 --> 06:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
stop what's been going on we've got to
 
06:28:00.110 --> 06:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
stop it at the front of the pipe and not
 
06:28:03.030 --> 06:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
have the unbelievable burden on our
 
06:28:05.310 --> 06:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
health and on our taxpayers of dealing
 
06:28:09.070 --> 06:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
with it at the end of the pipe so on the
 
06:28:12.670 --> 06:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
list of things that I'm seeking to ban
 
06:28:14.750 --> 06:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to see carpets upholstered
 
06:28:17.270 --> 06:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
furniture food packaging Cosmetics
 
06:28:20.030 --> 06:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
juvenile products dental floss yes
 
06:28:24.310 --> 06:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
dental floss and PPE this is a targeted
 
06:28:28.270 --> 06:28:28.280 align:start position:0%
past added ban product ban it's not
 
06:28:31.150 --> 06:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
across the board Maine had an across
 
06:28:35.070 --> 06:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
theboard ban Vermont um Minnesota has a
 
06:28:37.548 --> 06:28:37.558 align:start position:0%
band that's targeted initially and then
 
06:28:40.670 --> 06:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
it moves on to um across the board
 
06:28:44.590 --> 06:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
Vermont has um very identified products
 
06:28:46.990 --> 06:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
there are different things going on in
 
06:28:49.510 --> 06:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
different states but I really don't want
 
06:28:53.310 --> 06:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
this bill to conf be confused with um
 
06:28:55.510 --> 06:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
with Maine which was really a across the
 
06:28:59.270 --> 06:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
board and a huge lift for the state um
 
06:29:03.110 --> 06:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
and and there's a lot going on there um
 
06:29:05.468 --> 06:29:05.478 align:start position:0%
I really feel like I need to pause here
 
06:29:07.590 --> 06:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
and say that there are essential uses
 
06:29:09.830 --> 06:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
for past and I'm sure you're going to
 
06:29:11.628 --> 06:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
hear about something of some of them
 
06:29:14.468 --> 06:29:14.478 align:start position:0%
today but in crafting the bill I was
 
06:29:17.070 --> 06:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
cognizant of this and I really really
 
06:29:20.150 --> 06:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to carefully select products to
 
06:29:24.190 --> 06:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
include um that really there wasn't an
 
06:29:27.548 --> 06:29:27.558 align:start position:0%
uh essential use for uh pasas and dental
 
06:29:30.310 --> 06:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
floss for instance and it really puts
 
06:29:33.390 --> 06:29:33.400 align:start position:0%
less of a burden on the agency and its
 
06:29:35.830 --> 06:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
staff to work through a whole bunch of
 
06:29:38.070 --> 06:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
exemptions the products that you were
 
06:29:41.510 --> 06:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
chosen as you can see um in your
 
06:29:45.190 --> 06:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
information packets that I chose bulky
 
06:29:48.190 --> 06:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
items furniture and carpets in
 
06:29:50.788 --> 06:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
particular because they carry a huge
 
06:29:53.868 --> 06:29:53.878 align:start position:0%
load of pasas into the landfills and
 
06:29:56.070 --> 06:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
we've become in the working group really
 
06:30:00.390 --> 06:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
sensitive to the to the burden of P you
 
06:30:02.830 --> 06:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
know for for the landfills who aren't
 
06:30:05.628 --> 06:30:05.638 align:start position:0%
asking to have the stuff in them but
 
06:30:08.190 --> 06:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
they're the recipients and they have to
 
06:30:10.750 --> 06:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
um deal with them so that's one side of
 
06:30:14.868 --> 06:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
it um I also provided for you a chart
 
06:30:18.190 --> 06:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
from an organization called swana and
 
06:30:20.708 --> 06:30:20.718 align:start position:0%
that organization has identified the
 
06:30:24.070 --> 06:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
products from which we are most uh con
 
06:30:26.750 --> 06:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's okay from which we are most uh
 
06:30:31.110 --> 06:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
exposed food packaging uh Cosmetics a
 
06:30:32.788 --> 06:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
lot of us don't have to worry too much
 
06:30:35.270 --> 06:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
about that but it's a very real thing it
 
06:30:36.750 --> 06:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
reminds me of the days when Queen
 
06:30:38.750 --> 06:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth put lead on her face but
 
06:30:42.190 --> 06:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
anyway so food packaging uh foundation
 
06:30:45.590 --> 06:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
and lipstick dust carpets which I've
 
06:30:50.230 --> 06:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
included here um and those things are
 
06:30:52.708 --> 06:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
that's how I started to craft what I
 
06:30:55.230 --> 06:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to include in this bill and
 
06:30:57.628 --> 06:30:57.638 align:start position:0%
lastly and
 
06:31:01.548 --> 06:31:01.558 align:start position:0%
100% uh not least is I really wanted to
 
06:31:05.030 --> 06:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
focus on exposure of children to these
 
06:31:07.868 --> 06:31:07.878 align:start position:0%
products so I've included juvenile
 
06:31:12.070 --> 06:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
products in here and I also have PPE in
 
06:31:15.230 --> 06:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
here um our First Responders and Health
 
06:31:17.070 --> 06:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
Care Professionals shouldn't be subject
 
06:31:19.510 --> 06:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
to past to do their jobs and
 
06:31:22.190 --> 06:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately he had to leave but this B
 
06:31:25.070 --> 06:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
Bill does have the full support of the
 
06:31:27.430 --> 06:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
union for professional firefighters I
 
06:31:30.910 --> 06:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
spoke to the lobbyist earlier um today
 
06:31:32.590 --> 06:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
I've had really good discussions with
 
06:31:34.708 --> 06:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
them and they're extremely concerned
 
06:31:37.350 --> 06:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
about pasas in the Pro things that they
 
06:31:41.110 --> 06:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
wear to protect us we all handle sleep
 
06:31:43.990 --> 06:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
and walk on Floors we consume these
 
06:31:47.030 --> 06:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
products in our everyday lives at work
 
06:31:49.388 --> 06:31:49.398 align:start position:0%
at business I mean you may hear that
 
06:31:52.030 --> 06:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
businesses are opposed to this bill um
 
06:31:54.708 --> 06:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
or the you know the workers are hand
 
06:31:56.948 --> 06:31:56.958 align:start position:0%
handling these things our Municipal
 
06:31:59.510 --> 06:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
workers are handling these things we
 
06:32:02.150 --> 06:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
handle them in retailers we handle them
 
06:32:05.070 --> 06:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
in schools daycare centers restaurants
 
06:32:08.030 --> 06:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
and even swimming in our lakes and so
 
06:32:11.190 --> 06:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's just unavoidable for us so I don't
 
06:32:13.628 --> 06:32:13.638 align:start position:0%
know how much detail you want me to go
 
06:32:16.590 --> 06:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
into on the bill I just really want to
 
06:32:19.190 --> 06:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the definition
 
06:32:22.910 --> 06:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
the definition is Broad um it's
 
06:32:25.990 --> 06:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
intentionally broad it's broad because
 
06:32:28.350 --> 06:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
as there are various iterations of these
 
06:32:30.868 --> 06:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
chemicals that come through you know you
 
06:32:33.430 --> 06:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
don't want everything Twisted one way or
 
06:32:37.388 --> 06:32:37.398 align:start position:0%
another and it also um basically tracks
 
06:32:39.788 --> 06:32:39.798 align:start position:0%
the definitions that are used in 22
 
06:32:42.910 --> 06:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
States and also by our Department of
 
06:32:45.230 --> 06:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
Defense which is a really important
 
06:32:50.230 --> 06:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
Point um in addition the um the statutes
 
06:32:52.270 --> 06:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
that we have now in New Hampshire I had
 
06:32:56.190 --> 06:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
OS look at it the defin that we have of
 
06:33:00.150 --> 06:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
p is in our firefighting uh foam uh
 
06:33:02.350 --> 06:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
section and we've banned firefighting
 
06:33:05.948 --> 06:33:05.958 align:start position:0%
foam with intentionally added pasas and
 
06:33:09.310 --> 06:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
that so it tracks within our own um
 
06:33:12.868 --> 06:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
within our own statute and I have been
 
06:33:15.110 --> 06:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
told that businesses really prefer
 
06:33:16.708 --> 06:33:16.718 align:start position:0%
consistency in
 
06:33:20.670 --> 06:33:20.680 align:start position:0%
application um so that's it on the
 
06:33:23.468 --> 06:33:23.478 align:start position:0%
definition I've walked worked a lot on
 
06:33:25.430 --> 06:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
the understanding of
 
06:33:28.350 --> 06:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
chemistry I hesitate to even go into
 
06:33:30.590 --> 06:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
this at this late date but I just really
 
06:33:33.310 --> 06:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
I need to say this so we all our eyes
 
06:33:36.670 --> 06:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
don't glaze over I talked a long time to
 
06:33:38.670 --> 06:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
our toxicologist and he was really
 
06:33:41.230 --> 06:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
helpful there are longchain and short
 
06:33:45.030 --> 06:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
chain past they're polymeric and
 
06:33:48.110 --> 06:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
nonpolymeric these molecules all contain
 
06:33:50.628 --> 06:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
at least one carbon with Florine
 
06:33:54.030 --> 06:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
attached and these carbon Florine bonds
 
06:33:56.990 --> 06:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
are incredibly strong and that's why
 
06:33:59.830 --> 06:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
these chemicals have their staying power
 
06:34:02.788 --> 06:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
it gets confusing but on a really basic
 
06:34:05.830 --> 06:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
level let's not lose sight of this
 
06:34:09.110 --> 06:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
nonpolymeric pasas are long and short
 
06:34:12.830 --> 06:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
chain pasas chain refers to the number
 
06:34:17.750 --> 06:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
of carbons polymeric molecules are Daisy
 
06:34:21.190 --> 06:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
chained long and short chain past
 
06:34:23.628 --> 06:34:23.638 align:start position:0%
molecules and that's how you get to
 
06:34:27.190 --> 06:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
something with with a polymer like
 
06:34:30.750 --> 06:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
Teflon I would argue that you can't
 
06:34:34.388 --> 06:34:34.398 align:start position:0%
exclude polymeric molecules from the
 
06:34:37.388 --> 06:34:37.398 align:start position:0%
definition because polymeric the long
 
06:34:39.948 --> 06:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
ones are built with the Daisy chains of
 
06:34:42.510 --> 06:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
the short ones so that's in the
 
06:34:44.468 --> 06:34:44.478 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and it's also the
 
06:34:49.750 --> 06:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
degradation produ project um uh product
 
06:34:51.750 --> 06:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of it in a
 
06:34:53.990 --> 06:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
nutshell I think you need to keep your
 
06:34:55.948 --> 06:34:55.958 align:start position:0%
eye on that particular ball as you
 
06:34:58.788 --> 06:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
consider the definitional issues
 
06:35:00.948 --> 06:35:00.958 align:start position:0%
intentionally added is intentionally
 
06:35:03.270 --> 06:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
added we're not going after anybody that
 
06:35:06.510 --> 06:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
didn't on purpose put the pasas in their
 
06:35:10.030 --> 06:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
product to serve a purpose the Clearing
 
06:35:12.708 --> 06:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
House it's late there's so much to be
 
06:35:15.388 --> 06:35:15.398 align:start position:0%
said about the Clearing House it really
 
06:35:19.230 --> 06:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
is the mechanism by which states um
 
06:35:23.750 --> 06:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
enforce their uh their laws um I had a
 
06:35:26.270 --> 06:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
long discuss discussion with the folks
 
06:35:28.590 --> 06:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh that run the Clearing Houses they're
 
06:35:31.110 --> 06:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
more than happy to talk to the committee
 
06:35:33.430 --> 06:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
members um but the clearing house that
 
06:35:35.708 --> 06:35:35.718 align:start position:0%
would probably be used for this is
 
06:35:36.868 --> 06:35:36.878 align:start position:0%
called the
 
06:35:40.548 --> 06:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
ic2 I was told that the startup cost are
 
06:35:43.070 --> 06:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
going to probably be born by Maine and
 
06:35:45.590 --> 06:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
Minnesota their effective date is before
 
06:35:50.070 --> 06:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
hours um and that to participate in it
 
06:35:52.590 --> 06:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
it might not cost much more than
 
06:35:56.910 --> 06:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
$25,000 that may seem High compare it to
 
06:35:59.430 --> 06:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't even know what minuscule
 
06:36:01.468 --> 06:36:01.478 align:start position:0%
percentage that is of hundred or100
 
06:36:04.670 --> 06:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
million that the state's already spent
 
06:36:06.628 --> 06:36:06.638 align:start position:0%
and last but not least these effective
 
06:36:07.788 --> 06:36:07.798 align:start position:0%
dates are
 
06:36:10.788 --> 06:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
long-term um the the there's a
 
06:36:13.150 --> 06:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
notification provision for products to
 
06:36:16.868 --> 06:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
be prohibited for sale that is July 1st
 
06:36:19.510 --> 06:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
2026 the prohibition doesn't come
 
06:36:22.708 --> 06:36:22.718 align:start position:0%
effective until July 1st 2028 there's a
 
06:36:25.430 --> 06:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
labeling section it wouldn't become uh
 
06:36:26.788 --> 06:36:26.798 align:start position:0%
for things that aren't banned that
 
06:36:29.190 --> 06:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't become effective until
 
06:36:32.590 --> 06:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
2029 I feel the public deserves to know
 
06:36:34.990 --> 06:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
what has been buying these are like
 
06:36:37.548 --> 06:36:37.558 align:start position:0%
Parts the notification part the labeling
 
06:36:39.990 --> 06:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
part the ban part you can look at them
 
06:36:42.110 --> 06:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
sort of individually as you're looking
 
06:36:45.548 --> 06:36:45.558 align:start position:0%
at the bill so that's it the bills
 
06:36:48.070 --> 06:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
attempt to this is a bill that attempts
 
06:36:50.270 --> 06:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
to stop the influx of these dangerous
 
06:36:52.788 --> 06:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
chemicals in our state there's really no
 
06:36:55.310 --> 06:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
other way and if there 's any state that
 
06:36:57.670 --> 06:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
has suffered from past contamination
 
06:37:00.590 --> 06:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's ours we need to be brave we need to
 
06:37:03.510 --> 06:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
take a bold step like this to stop it
 
06:37:05.350 --> 06:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
and we can't always wait for other
 
06:37:07.868 --> 06:37:07.878 align:start position:0%
states to take necessary action we
 
06:37:11.110 --> 06:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
should lead like we did with Mercury why
 
06:37:13.708 --> 06:37:13.718 align:start position:0%
like we did with the uh MCL testing
 
06:37:16.708 --> 06:37:16.718 align:start position:0%
levels which is the past testing levels
 
06:37:19.830 --> 06:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
and I will stop there and if you uh want
 
06:37:21.910 --> 06:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
to ask me any questions I'd be more than
 
06:37:24.310 --> 06:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them and thank you for
 
06:37:24.320 --> 06:37:30.310 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them and thank you for
your

consideration okay thank you
 
06:37:36.270 --> 06:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
Karen okay uh so I have a pile of reps
 
06:37:39.270 --> 06:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
so uh given the tradition we do reps
 
06:37:51.548 --> 06:37:51.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:53.708 --> 06:37:53.718 align:start position:0%
Boyd good afternoon Mr chairman thank

a co- sponsor looking to restrict
 
06:38:15.948 --> 06:38:15.958 align:start position:0%
certain products made with posos um I
 
06:38:18.350 --> 06:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
would certainly want to amplify uh the
 
06:38:21.590 --> 06:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
com the comments that have been made by
 
06:38:23.708 --> 06:38:23.718 align:start position:0%
representative uh eel and I want to
 
06:38:26.030 --> 06:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
amplify I with just a couple of thoughts
 
06:38:27.868 --> 06:38:27.878 align:start position:0%
uh for your consideration as you
 
06:38:30.948 --> 06:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
deliberate uh this
 
06:38:33.468 --> 06:38:33.478 align:start position:0%
bill I currently chair the New Hampshire
 
06:38:35.468 --> 06:38:35.478 align:start position:0%
drinking water and groundwater advisory
 
06:38:38.030 --> 06:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
commission the commission was formed
 
06:38:41.468 --> 06:38:41.478 align:start position:0%
back in 2016 after the state one an MTB
 
06:38:46.468 --> 06:38:46.478 align:start position:0%
mtbe settlement and $277 million was
 
06:38:48.468 --> 06:38:48.478 align:start position:0%
entrusted with this particular fund
 
06:38:50.910 --> 06:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
currently the trust fund has already
 
06:38:54.628 --> 06:38:54.638 align:start position:0%
expended $140 million to
 
06:38:56.830 --> 06:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
granted State Community specifically
 
06:39:00.070 --> 06:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
targeting pollution contamination Source
 
06:39:02.030 --> 06:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
water development
 
06:39:06.150 --> 06:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um groundwater protection
 
06:39:09.230 --> 06:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
anything as it relates to water we've
 
06:39:11.468 --> 06:39:11.478 align:start position:0%
had a positive impact on communities
 
06:39:14.070 --> 06:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
that have made application to us looking
 
06:39:17.350 --> 06:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
to improve uh portability issues that
 
06:39:19.230 --> 06:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
they have in their particular
 
06:39:21.910 --> 06:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
Community my community in marac has been
 
06:39:24.750 --> 06:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
Amplified by posos
 
06:39:28.270 --> 06:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
impacting our particular water wells
 
06:39:31.070 --> 06:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
that that occurred through a company
 
06:39:33.548 --> 06:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
that is no longer no longer in my
 
06:39:37.750 --> 06:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:41.468 --> 06:39:41.478 align:start position:0%
Bain we have made a commitment in the
 
06:39:43.628 --> 06:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
town of marac to the tune of $17
 
06:39:45.990 --> 06:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
million in providing clean portable
 
06:39:48.030 --> 06:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
water to clean up the mess that sang go
 
06:39:51.388 --> 06:39:51.398 align:start position:0%
ban has had I say this because my
 
06:39:54.190 --> 06:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
commission has made an investment in to
 
06:39:56.510 --> 06:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
these communities who have sought to
 
06:39:57.990 --> 06:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
provide their communities with clean
 
06:40:03.430 --> 06:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:06.510 --> 06:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
becomes it becomes prohibitive if we do
 
06:40:09.110 --> 06:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
not begin to take the necessary First
 
06:40:12.190 --> 06:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
Steps regarding products that get tossed
 
06:40:14.830 --> 06:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
into our local landfills from from
 
06:40:16.990 --> 06:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
leeching into our groundwater we will be
 
06:40:20.030 --> 06:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
spending more money in the long run
 
06:40:22.110 --> 06:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
trying to clean up the mess than being
 
06:40:24.590 --> 06:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
proactive and trying to begin to put
 
06:40:29.270 --> 06:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
specific rules in place that can have a
 
06:40:32.030 --> 06:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
positive impact on ensuring that the
 
06:40:35.830 --> 06:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
groundwater in our great state is clean
 
06:40:38.990 --> 06:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
and pure not just for us but for future
 
06:40:41.590 --> 06:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
Generations that come to the Granite
 
06:40:44.468 --> 06:40:44.478 align:start position:0%
State the one last thing that I would
 
06:40:46.150 --> 06:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
bring to your attention is the town of
 
06:40:48.868 --> 06:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
miramac has a landfill and there are
 
06:40:51.230 --> 06:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
three houses that are but the landfill
 
06:40:54.468 --> 06:40:54.478 align:start position:0%
and currently in marac we have
 
06:40:56.150 --> 06:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
testing Wells that are currently
 
06:40:58.270 --> 06:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring those particular Wells not
 
06:41:01.190 --> 06:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
just for past but for every known
 
06:41:03.750 --> 06:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
carcinogenic chemical that may exist
 
06:41:06.190 --> 06:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
underneath that particular landfill a
 
06:41:08.708 --> 06:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
couple years ago prior to me becoming a
 
06:41:11.788 --> 06:41:11.798 align:start position:0%
member of the uh honorable General Court
 
06:41:14.708 --> 06:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
served on the Town Council and three of
 
06:41:16.830 --> 06:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
those houses were impacted by leech
 
06:41:19.510 --> 06:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
eight from our landfill that got into
 
06:41:22.150 --> 06:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
the groundwater that impacted their
 
06:41:24.788 --> 06:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
personal drinking Wells with the help of
 
06:41:26.468 --> 06:41:26.478 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
06:41:29.750 --> 06:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
the town of marac proactively accepted
 
06:41:32.350 --> 06:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility they have monitoring and
 
06:41:33.830 --> 06:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
they have filtration at those three
 
06:41:36.070 --> 06:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
particular houses now my community is
 
06:41:38.628 --> 06:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
very lucky it's three houses if we look
 
06:41:40.350 --> 06:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
at the communities that reside over by
 
06:41:43.150 --> 06:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
KAG landfill and by pe Air Force Base
 
06:41:44.750 --> 06:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
the impacts that have occurred with
 
06:41:46.230 --> 06:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
within those particular communities are
 
06:41:48.270 --> 06:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
far more dramatic than what has occurred
 
06:41:51.388 --> 06:41:51.398 align:start position:0%
in my own Community but it should
 
06:41:53.788 --> 06:41:53.798 align:start position:0%
serve and I would hope it would serve
 
06:41:55.350 --> 06:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
and I I don't like to use dramatic
 
06:41:56.830 --> 06:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
language but I would hope that it would
 
06:41:59.350 --> 06:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
serve as a claring call to all of us
 
06:42:01.948 --> 06:42:01.958 align:start position:0%
that we have a responsibility to take
 
06:42:05.270 --> 06:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
the necessary first steps of making sure
 
06:42:08.070 --> 06:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
that when when products are being made
 
06:42:10.030 --> 06:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
that they're not using that they're not
 
06:42:13.070 --> 06:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
using Posas so that we we're allowing
 
06:42:15.910 --> 06:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
those future generations to be able to
 
06:42:18.468 --> 06:42:18.478 align:start position:0%
drink clean portable water and I would
 
06:42:22.548 --> 06:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
be remiss two years ago uh this is the
 
06:42:25.230 --> 06:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
third attempt at trying to pass a bill I
 
06:42:27.990 --> 06:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
introduced one representative Boer thank
 
06:42:29.750 --> 06:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
you very much because I was the only
 
06:42:32.030 --> 06:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor on that particular Bill and you
 
06:42:33.708 --> 06:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
were kind enough to ask me did I ask
 
06:42:36.388 --> 06:42:36.398 align:start position:0%
anybody else and I sheepishly told you
 
06:42:38.708 --> 06:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
that I thought I ought to go at it alone
 
06:42:40.830 --> 06:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
but here the third draft this is the
 
06:42:42.788 --> 06:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
third go around and look at the number
 
06:42:45.070 --> 06:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
of co-sponsors that we have on here and
 
06:42:46.190 --> 06:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
I think that's a Testament of the
 
06:42:47.708 --> 06:42:47.718 align:start position:0%
commitment not just to representative
 
06:42:49.868 --> 06:42:49.878 align:start position:0%
email and my colleagues from marac
 
06:42:51.510 --> 06:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas representative
 
06:42:53.708 --> 06:42:53.718 align:start position:0%
Murphy representative Rong
 
06:42:55.708 --> 06:42:55.718 align:start position:0%
representative Healey uh representative
 
06:42:58.230 --> 06:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
Ned that have sounded um that have
 
06:43:00.750 --> 06:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
worked hard to bring this issue to the
 
06:43:03.110 --> 06:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
Forefront and I sincerely hope in your
 
06:43:06.230 --> 06:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
deliberations that you'll give 1649 it's
 
06:43:09.708 --> 06:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
due deliberation and hopefully maybe
 
06:43:11.830 --> 06:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
begin to take the necessary First Steps
 
06:43:15.548 --> 06:43:15.558 align:start position:0%
so that we can ensure that landfills are
 
06:43:18.948 --> 06:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
not filled with PE us which ultimately
 
06:43:22.110 --> 06:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
will leachate into our groundwater let's
 
06:43:24.190 --> 06:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
let's have the impact now and take the
 
06:43:26.670 --> 06:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
first steps and as representative evil
 
06:43:28.750 --> 06:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
so aply put it take the necessary first
 
06:43:31.868 --> 06:43:31.878 align:start position:0%
steps to to attack the issue like we did
 
06:43:34.548 --> 06:43:34.558 align:start position:0%
with Mercury I thank you very much for
 
06:43:35.708 --> 06:43:35.718 align:start position:0%

entertain uh any
 
06:43:41.310 --> 06:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
questions uh I think at this late hour
 
06:43:42.868 --> 06:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be asking too many
 
06:43:44.990 --> 06:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
questions you know what I I certainly
 
06:43:47.190 --> 06:43:47.200 align:start position:0%

aggressive maximum contaminant levels
 
06:44:52.990 --> 06:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
for several pasas and drinking water we
 
06:44:55.948 --> 06:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
were Le leaders in the country in taking
 
06:44:58.230 --> 06:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
action to protect the health of granite
 
06:45:00.990 --> 06:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
Staters and that leadership has proven
 
06:45:03.990 --> 06:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
to be the right decision since then
 
06:45:06.868 --> 06:45:06.878 align:start position:0%
other states followed and the uscpa is
 
06:45:10.990 --> 06:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
on the verge of finalizing proposed
 
06:45:14.110 --> 06:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
mcls I'm asking you to take a leadership
 
06:45:14.120 --> 06:45:15.350 align:start position:0%
mcls I'm asking you to take a leadership
position

06:45:15.350 --> 06:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
position
 
06:45:19.190 --> 06:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
Now by supporting HB
 
06:45:22.510 --> 06:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
1649 there is overwhelming evidence from
 
06:45:25.230 --> 06:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
around the globe of the carcinogenesis
 
06:45:28.468 --> 06:45:28.478 align:start position:0%
from pasas last year the National
 
06:45:31.388 --> 06:45:31.398 align:start position:0%
Institute of Health's National Cancer
 
06:45:34.310 --> 06:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
Institute working group upgraded one of
 
06:45:37.030 --> 06:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
the first past p
 
06:45:40.310 --> 06:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
pfoa as to a human carcinogen level and
 
06:45:42.270 --> 06:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
I expect other P to
 
06:45:45.230 --> 06:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
follow this threat to human health is
 
06:45:48.430 --> 06:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
compounded by the fact that past do not
 
06:45:52.628 --> 06:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
go away they bioaccumulate in nature so
 
06:45:54.548 --> 06:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
we will never reach reduce the amount
 
06:45:57.628 --> 06:45:57.638 align:start position:0%
currently in the world we can only stop
 
06:46:02.310 --> 06:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
more from being released HB 1649 does
 
06:46:05.830 --> 06:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
just that it prevents unnecessary pasas
 
06:46:08.270 --> 06:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
from entering New Hampshire in the form
 
06:46:11.430 --> 06:46:11.440 align:start position:0%

06:46:19.230 --> 06:46:19.240 align:start position:0%

06:46:22.708 --> 06:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
restricting these by restricting these
 
06:46:24.788 --> 06:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
past containing products in New
 
06:46:27.110 --> 06:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we restrict them from our
 
06:46:30.670 --> 06:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
landfills and landfill leate we restrict
 
06:46:32.830 --> 06:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
them from entering the air through
 
06:46:35.190 --> 06:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
incineration and we restrict them from
 
06:46:38.388 --> 06:46:38.398 align:start position:0%
Human contact we reduce cancer-causing
 
06:46:41.350 --> 06:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
exposure to Granite sters with this
 
06:46:43.948 --> 06:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
bill now this isn't the first time
 
06:46:46.548 --> 06:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
chemicals bans have been passed and
 
06:46:48.868 --> 06:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
those were likely met from opposition
 
06:46:48.878 --> 06:46:52.310 align:start position:0%
those were likely met from opposition
from

06:46:52.310 --> 06:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:54.868 --> 06:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
businesses makers of electrical
 
06:46:58.868 --> 06:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
equipment Transformers opposed the PCP
 
06:47:01.910 --> 06:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
ban it was a tough uninstallation
 
06:47:04.708 --> 06:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturers when asbestos was
 
06:47:08.070 --> 06:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
banned the cost of replacing hazardous
 
06:47:11.628 --> 06:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
substances with safer Alternatives is
 
06:47:15.670 --> 06:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
costly but it's much more costly to get
 
06:47:17.708 --> 06:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
them out of our environment it's much
 
06:47:21.110 --> 06:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
more costly to address the health
 
06:47:23.590 --> 06:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
impacts that hazardous chemicals create
 
06:47:26.190 --> 06:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
create so it is going to take strong
 
06:47:28.190 --> 06:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
leadership on your part and the part of
 
06:47:31.510 --> 06:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire General Court to pass
 
06:47:34.150 --> 06:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and show but it will show the
 
06:47:36.628 --> 06:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
rest of the country that this can be
 
06:47:39.190 --> 06:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
done and it can be done effectively but
 
06:47:41.628 --> 06:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
we are leaders and we've taken strong
 
06:47:44.708 --> 06:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
actions and sent strong messages before
 
06:47:48.270 --> 06:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
Let's Do It Again by passing HB
 
06:47:52.230 --> 06:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
1649 and I have all night to answer your
 
06:47:52.240 --> 06:47:54.830 align:start position:0%
1649 and I have all night to answer your
questions

06:47:54.830 --> 06:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:47:57.830 --> 06:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank
 
06:48:08.708 --> 06:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:12.070 --> 06:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair and members of
 
06:48:15.230 --> 06:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
the committee uh I had emailed you my
 
06:48:17.388 --> 06:48:17.398 align:start position:0%
testimony um because I thought there was
 
06:48:19.830 --> 06:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
a conflict with me being an executive
 
06:48:22.510 --> 06:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
session in my committee I'm not going to
 
06:48:25.708 --> 06:48:25.718 align:start position:0%
repeat that that um you you're going to
 
06:48:27.468 --> 06:48:27.478 align:start position:0%
be hearing things about persistent
 
06:48:29.910 --> 06:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
environment environmental pre pressure
 
06:48:32.310 --> 06:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh presence bio accumulation things like
 
06:48:35.510 --> 06:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
that I was asked to bring it down to the
 
06:48:35.520 --> 06:48:36.310 align:start position:0%
that I was asked to bring it down to the
real

06:48:36.310 --> 06:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
real
 
06:48:41.430 --> 06:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
world so recently thech who has declared
 
06:48:44.830 --> 06:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
that pooa is a carcinogenic substance
 
06:48:47.990 --> 06:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
we've all suspected this um we now have
 
06:48:50.990 --> 06:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
proof and it's very likely as uh
 
06:48:53.670 --> 06:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative rang just mentioned p is
 
06:48:58.230 --> 06:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:00.750 --> 06:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
carcinogenic as I've testified before I
 
06:49:03.590 --> 06:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
live three miles from St gobain which is
 
06:49:05.948 --> 06:49:05.958 align:start position:0%
the industrial polluter in the town of
 
06:49:08.310 --> 06:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
marac and by the way I am representative
 
06:49:11.628 --> 06:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas from the town of
 
06:49:15.230 --> 06:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
marac uh and originally we were told
 
06:49:16.788 --> 06:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
that only the residents that lived
 
06:49:19.030 --> 06:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
within a half mile of s gobain had to be
 
06:49:20.910 --> 06:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about water contamination then
 
06:49:22.548 --> 06:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
they did some testing they moved it out
 
06:49:25.430 --> 06:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
to a full full mile we live 3 miles from
 
06:49:27.830 --> 06:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
s cabain we have a private well we
 
06:49:30.070 --> 06:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
decided to get it tested in
 
06:49:32.548 --> 06:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
2016 the results came back so high that
 
06:49:34.948 --> 06:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
we had to shut the well down
 
06:49:37.388 --> 06:49:37.398 align:start position:0%
immediately I have six children and they
 
06:49:39.230 --> 06:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
all grew up drinking that
 
06:49:44.070 --> 06:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
water on my street I I border the the
 
06:49:46.270 --> 06:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
very edge of an old neighborhood they
 
06:49:48.948 --> 06:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
all have private Wells there are four
 
06:49:51.030 --> 06:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
houses on my street that have private
 
06:49:53.548 --> 06:49:53.558 align:start position:0%
wells in house number one
 
06:49:56.548 --> 06:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
the dad has died of kidney cancer in
 
06:49:59.548 --> 06:49:59.558 align:start position:0%
house number two the dad and the adult
 
06:50:03.030 --> 06:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
son have died from colon cancer in house
 
06:50:05.110 --> 06:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
number three which is right next door to
 
06:50:07.750 --> 06:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
mine the dad is dying right now of stage
 
06:50:10.910 --> 06:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
four prostate cancer house number four
 
06:50:14.510 --> 06:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
is my house I've testified before that I
 
06:50:17.548 --> 06:50:17.558 align:start position:0%
have breast cancer and the oncologists
 
06:50:19.750 --> 06:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth Hitchcock because of my
 
06:50:22.750 --> 06:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
blood tests which indicate I have 12
 
06:50:25.070 --> 06:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
people fast chemicals in my blood that
 
06:50:27.150 --> 06:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
are above the toxic limit that's allowed
 
06:50:27.160 --> 06:50:27.990 align:start position:0%
are above the toxic limit that's allowed
for

06:50:27.990 --> 06:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:50:31.350 --> 06:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
humans the the oncologist said darith
 
06:50:34.830 --> 06:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
hitok have have as much as they are able
 
06:50:38.510 --> 06:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
to have linked my breast cancer to past
 
06:50:40.948 --> 06:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
contamination because I have so much
 
06:50:43.708 --> 06:50:43.718 align:start position:0%
pasas in my blood they have said that my
 
06:50:46.310 --> 06:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
body is a quote ticking Time Bomb for
 
06:50:49.070 --> 06:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
more cancer and because of that I had to
 
06:50:50.788 --> 06:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
have my ovaries and Fallopian tubes
 
06:50:53.990 --> 06:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
removed prophylactically that's the way
 
06:50:56.230 --> 06:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
we survive in a town that is in
 
06:50:58.990 --> 06:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
contaminated with pfast chemicals we
 
06:51:01.270 --> 06:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
amputate parts of our bodies to keep
 
06:51:03.910 --> 06:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
ahead of any potential
 
06:51:07.510 --> 06:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
cancer my husband has heart issues at
 
06:51:10.070 --> 06:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
age 55 he had several heart attacks and
 
06:51:12.670 --> 06:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
had to have a quadruple stent that's
 
06:51:15.628 --> 06:51:15.638 align:start position:0%
connected to past contamination he has
 
06:51:19.670 --> 06:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
cholesterol issues he has weight issues
 
06:51:22.548 --> 06:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
obesity is big in our town and it's not
 
06:51:25.190 --> 06:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
because were lazy people it's past
 
06:51:27.788 --> 06:51:27.798 align:start position:0%
contamination they are endocrine
 
06:51:31.310 --> 06:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
disruptors hormones Rule the World um if
 
06:51:33.788 --> 06:51:33.798 align:start position:0%
you upset those you're going to get
 
06:51:37.708 --> 06:51:37.718 align:start position:0%
added weight um my husband has kidney
 
06:51:39.948 --> 06:51:39.958 align:start position:0%
issues he just uh had kidney stones
 
06:51:42.430 --> 06:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
removed he has bladder issues I
 
06:51:44.270 --> 06:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned I have six
 
06:51:47.350 --> 06:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
children I have an adult son with heart
 
06:51:50.990 --> 06:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
issues he's in his late 20s uh several
 
06:51:54.150 --> 06:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
of my kids have cholesterol issues
 
06:51:56.388 --> 06:51:56.398 align:start position:0%
several of my kids have autoimmune
 
06:51:58.830 --> 06:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
issues the majority of my children have
 
06:51:58.840 --> 06:52:00.070 align:start position:0%
issues the majority of my children have
immune

06:52:00.070 --> 06:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
immune
 
06:52:03.510 --> 06:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
dysfunction in the last 15 years I've
 
06:52:06.388 --> 06:52:06.398 align:start position:0%
had to put four dogs down to cancer in
 
06:52:06.398 --> 06:52:07.430 align:start position:0%
had to put four dogs down to cancer in
my

06:52:07.430 --> 06:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:52:11.830 --> 06:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
house so there is a huge impact it's
 
06:52:15.468 --> 06:52:15.478 align:start position:0%
huge this is a poisonous carcinogenic
 
06:52:18.070 --> 06:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
substance that is killing people in my
 
06:52:20.948 --> 06:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
town and it is killing my family but it
 
06:52:24.190 --> 06:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
is also impacting our town
 
06:52:25.990 --> 06:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
economically how do you think I'm going
 
06:52:27.948 --> 06:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
to be able to sell a house where you
 
06:52:31.270 --> 06:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
can't use the water who's going to buy a
 
06:52:35.190 --> 06:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
house in a town that is forever
 
06:52:37.230 --> 06:52:37.240 align:start position:0%
contaminated let's talk about health
 
06:52:40.788 --> 06:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
care costs even with insurance to to
 
06:52:43.150 --> 06:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
have a disease like cancer I have to
 
06:52:45.590 --> 06:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
take time off I have to drive I have to
 
06:52:47.310 --> 06:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
pay for parking and I have to pay for
 
06:52:50.270 --> 06:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
co-pays and I have to pay for
 
06:52:53.510 --> 06:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
medication because I have The Misfortune
 
06:52:57.230 --> 06:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
to be exposed to a carcinogenic
 
06:52:59.388 --> 06:52:59.398 align:start position:0%
substance what we're telling people in
 
06:53:02.190 --> 06:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
our town is to filter your water just
 
06:53:04.468 --> 06:53:04.478 align:start position:0%
even if you're on public water filter it
 
06:53:06.910 --> 06:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
keep you and your family safe when we
 
06:53:08.948 --> 06:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
put in our whole house filtration system
 
06:53:08.958 --> 06:53:09.750 align:start position:0%
put in our whole house filtration system
in

06:53:09.750 --> 06:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:53:12.788 --> 06:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
2016 it cost about
 
06:53:15.310 --> 06:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
$5,000 now that price has come down a
 
06:53:17.590 --> 06:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
little bit but they're still upkeep to
 
06:53:20.350 --> 06:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
replace the filters every year is about
 
06:53:23.948 --> 06:53:23.958 align:start position:0%
$500 this is an added cost that we are
 
06:53:26.110 --> 06:53:26.120 align:start position:0%
paying and whoever lives in my house is
 
06:53:28.468 --> 06:53:28.478 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay for the rest of
 
06:53:31.388 --> 06:53:31.398 align:start position:0%
time because this was done to
 
06:53:34.548 --> 06:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
us lastly there's there's bottled water
 
06:53:36.788 --> 06:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
costs people in my town are afraid of
 
06:53:39.110 --> 06:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
drinking the water and so they're buying
 
06:53:42.750 --> 06:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
bottled water it adds up especially if
 
06:53:45.468 --> 06:53:45.478 align:start position:0%
you've got kids so the only way to
 
06:53:47.868 --> 06:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
address this is to do something called
 
06:53:51.628 --> 06:53:51.638 align:start position:0%
stop the tap and that means to stop the
 
06:53:55.548 --> 06:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
flow of P gas chemicals coming into our
 
06:53:59.270 --> 06:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
state into our lives and this bill is an
 
06:54:03.230 --> 06:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
important step to make that happen it
 
06:54:06.830 --> 06:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
must be considered and it must be passed
 
06:54:09.110 --> 06:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
06:54:21.670 --> 06:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:21.680 --> 06:54:33.070 align:start position:0%
 
up

06:54:33.070 --> 06:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:35.628 --> 06:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
uh Carrie spear ward 3
 
06:54:38.910 --> 06:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
Nashua I took a different tact and what
 
06:54:42.430 --> 06:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
I wanted to do uh is look at the actual
 
06:54:45.190 --> 06:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
research both in the United States and
 
06:54:47.910 --> 06:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
in Europe because Europe actually if you
 
06:54:51.590 --> 06:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
can imagine has more P Fest than we
 
06:54:51.600 --> 06:54:53.388 align:start position:0%
can imagine has more P Fest than we
do

06:54:53.388 --> 06:54:53.398 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:54:55.708 --> 06:54:55.718 align:start position:0%
and so I wanted to go to sources of
 
06:54:57.310 --> 06:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
research so I went to the National
 
06:55:01.110 --> 06:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
Institutes of Health to find out do they
 
06:55:04.310 --> 06:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
act do people actually understand how
 
06:55:08.310 --> 06:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
pasas attacks the various organs of our
 
06:55:11.270 --> 06:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
body and the research is
 
06:55:15.670 --> 06:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
there uh I learned about how it attacks
 
06:55:18.750 --> 06:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh fatty acids in the kidneys I learned
 
06:55:22.628 --> 06:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
about how it attacks the uh the
 
06:55:25.430 --> 06:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
connective tissues between our bones how
 
06:55:29.350 --> 06:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
it destroys our bones I looked at a lot
 
06:55:31.590 --> 06:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
of research on this and I presented some
 
06:55:33.628 --> 06:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
of it in the paper that I gave you so
 
06:55:35.548 --> 06:55:35.558 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go back and I've saved
 
06:55:37.110 --> 06:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
all the links and I've saved all the
 
06:55:38.628 --> 06:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
papers so if you really want to weigh
 
06:55:41.190 --> 06:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
through some of that stuff it's it's
 
06:55:44.388 --> 06:55:44.398 align:start position:0%
pretty heavy so to say that it's just
 
06:55:47.910 --> 06:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
statistically known that's really not
 
06:55:50.830 --> 06:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
accurate the research is really starting
 
06:55:53.310 --> 06:55:53.320 align:start position:0%
to come out ever since 20
 
06:55:55.548 --> 06:55:55.558 align:start position:0%
around 2000 when this stuff became
 
06:55:55.558 --> 06:55:57.430 align:start position:0%
around 2000 when this stuff became
obviously

06:55:57.430 --> 06:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
06:55:59.990 --> 06:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
bad uh all kinds of agencies have
 
06:56:02.270 --> 06:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
decided to actually do the research on
 
06:56:04.868 --> 06:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
this and so I think the information is
 
06:56:07.830 --> 06:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
there what I did want to do is address
 
06:56:09.230 --> 06:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
the fact
 
06:56:12.628 --> 06:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
that the FDA doesn't really test this
 
06:56:15.910 --> 06:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
stuff at all and so when uh various
 
06:56:18.868 --> 06:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
chemical companies present their data
 
06:56:23.388 --> 06:56:23.398 align:start position:0%
they only present what they feel
 
06:56:26.190 --> 06:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
is appropriate at the time breakdown
 
06:56:28.388 --> 06:56:28.398 align:start position:0%
products are not
 
06:56:30.948 --> 06:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
discussed and so as a result of that we
 
06:56:32.708 --> 06:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
don't see the whole picture for instance
 
06:56:34.948 --> 06:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
we were talking about
 
06:56:38.230 --> 06:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
non-polymeric uh chains but when they uh
 
06:56:39.910 --> 06:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry when they
 
06:56:42.230 --> 06:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh let me get this right I don't want to
 
06:56:42.240 --> 06:56:43.070 align:start position:0%
uh let me get this right I don't want to
be

06:56:43.070 --> 06:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:56:45.628 --> 06:56:45.638 align:start position:0%
wrong when we talk about polymeric
 
06:56:47.388 --> 06:56:47.398 align:start position:0%
chains they break down into
 
06:56:50.388 --> 06:56:50.398 align:start position:0%
non-polymeric chains so originally the
 
06:56:52.510 --> 06:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
polymeric chains were considered the the
 
06:56:55.030 --> 06:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
The Cure All well they're not because
 
06:56:56.868 --> 06:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
when they break down they break down to
 
06:57:00.110 --> 06:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
the bad ones the same thing with
 
06:57:04.310 --> 06:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
hfc's were replaced by hfos when hfos
 
06:57:07.628 --> 06:57:07.638 align:start position:0%
break down they release a a chemical
 
06:57:10.510 --> 06:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
called tfas tfas is just another version
 
06:57:10.520 --> 06:57:11.430 align:start position:0%
called tfas tfas is just another version
of

06:57:11.430 --> 06:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:57:14.430 --> 06:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
PFS and the problem is they stay in the
 
06:57:17.230 --> 06:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
environment for decades and so we're
 
06:57:19.788 --> 06:57:19.798 align:start position:0%
just polluting with another product it's
 
06:57:21.948 --> 06:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
a breakdown product but that wasn't
 
06:57:21.958 --> 06:57:22.910 align:start position:0%
a breakdown product but that wasn't
presented

06:57:22.910 --> 06:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
presented
 
06:57:24.830 --> 06:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
where I found the research for that one
 
06:57:27.430 --> 06:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
was in Germany they did extensive
 
06:57:30.750 --> 06:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
research on tfas and it's it's they're
 
06:57:33.110 --> 06:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
working on rules to ban it in in in
 
06:57:35.310 --> 06:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
Germany so the these are the kinds of
 
06:57:37.110 --> 06:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
things I wanted to look at and I
 
06:57:38.708 --> 06:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
presented a little bit of that in the
 
06:57:40.830 --> 06:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
paper and so I'll just leave you with
 
06:57:44.110 --> 06:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
that one of the thoughts I have given
 
06:57:46.548 --> 06:57:46.558 align:start position:0%
the brand n uh the uh the huge nature of
 
06:57:48.868 --> 06:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
the problem it's time that the
 
06:57:51.750 --> 06:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers themselves stop putting
 
06:57:54.750 --> 06:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
the cost on the taxpayer who never even
 
06:57:57.510 --> 06:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
knew these products were bad even though
 
06:58:00.750 --> 06:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
the known uh based on lawsuits that it
 
06:58:04.590 --> 06:58:04.600 align:start position:0%
was known by 3M and and uh Dupont for 30
 
06:58:08.070 --> 06:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
years 40 years 50 years they started
 
06:58:10.628 --> 06:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
seeing their own employees get sick and
 
06:58:13.590 --> 06:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
die and this is the first time it wasn't
 
06:58:16.030 --> 06:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
until 2000 that that information became
 
06:58:18.548 --> 06:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
public so it's really kind of time that
 
06:58:18.558 --> 06:58:20.468 align:start position:0%
public so it's really kind of time that
the

06:58:20.468 --> 06:58:20.478 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:58:22.670 --> 06:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturers kind of paid their due
 
06:58:24.670 --> 06:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
diligence that we've been suffering with
 
06:58:26.910 --> 06:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
for all these years and take
 
06:58:30.270 --> 06:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility and find Alternatives and
 
06:58:31.910 --> 06:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
I think that it's about time that they
 
06:58:33.868 --> 06:58:33.878 align:start position:0%
did that now we saw some Bill from
 
06:58:37.468 --> 06:58:37.478 align:start position:0%
someone who was in the motorcycle group
 
06:58:39.230 --> 06:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
and they said well they make junior
 
06:58:41.510 --> 06:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
motorcycles for little kids or small
 
06:58:42.948 --> 06:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
children and then they shouldn't be
 
06:58:44.468 --> 06:58:44.478 align:start position:0%
banned and they're very safe and all
 
06:58:46.990 --> 06:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing and we're not Banning
 
06:58:49.948 --> 06:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
motorcycles but I will tell you that the
 
06:58:52.788 --> 06:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
headliner for the motorcycle helmet
 
06:58:56.190 --> 06:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
is made out of past laced chemicals that
 
06:58:59.468 --> 06:58:59.478 align:start position:0%
are sitting on children's heads and that
 
06:59:01.350 --> 06:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
the idea that that's what they want for
 
06:59:03.788 --> 06:59:03.798 align:start position:0%
their children when there are
 
06:59:06.150 --> 06:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
alternatives I I can't even begin to
 
06:59:08.750 --> 06:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
Fathom why somebody would want that so I
 
06:59:10.948 --> 06:59:10.958 align:start position:0%
think that the fact that we paired the
 
06:59:12.910 --> 06:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
bill down to a set of
 
06:59:15.510 --> 06:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
products and I and I've seen products in
 
06:59:18.310 --> 06:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
Hairspray I've seen products in face
 
06:59:21.670 --> 06:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
wash it doesn't belong on our faces and
 
06:59:23.910 --> 06:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
the product s will break down and when
 
06:59:26.110 --> 06:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
they break down they go into the
 
06:59:28.948 --> 06:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
groundwater eventually through uh
 
06:59:32.310 --> 06:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
getting absorbed through the ground
 
06:59:34.910 --> 06:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
so everybody else has a whole lot to say
 
06:59:36.350 --> 06:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
about it and I don't want to say anymore
 
06:59:38.190 --> 06:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to leave you with the idea
 
06:59:40.430 --> 06:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
that there is real research that has
 
06:59:43.310 --> 06:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
been done and has proved the mechanisms
 
06:59:44.990 --> 06:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
and it's being done both in the United
 
06:59:51.030 --> 06:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:02.628 --> 07:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:04.948 --> 07:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
Walter okay you just we'll just pass
 
07:00:19.230 --> 07:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:21.830 --> 07:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
Murphy good afternoon chairman hunt and
 
07:00:23.548 --> 07:00:23.558 align:start position:0%
honorable hble members of the committee
 
07:00:25.548 --> 07:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
I'm Nancy Murphy I represent the town of
 
07:00:28.948 --> 07:00:28.958 align:start position:0%
March Hillsboro District 12 um I've
 
07:00:31.430 --> 07:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
submitted my personal testimony on to
 
07:00:33.110 --> 07:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
the committee online and with your
 
07:00:35.510 --> 07:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
permission I'd like to share testimony
 
07:00:38.150 --> 07:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
and support of hb1 1649 from
 
07:00:41.590 --> 07:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
environmental scientist Public Health um
 
07:00:44.510 --> 07:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me public health scientist
 
07:00:45.948 --> 07:00:45.958 align:start position:0%
author and former representative The
 
07:00:48.270 --> 07:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
Honorable Mindy Mesmer over the past
 
07:00:50.350 --> 07:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
several years con consumers have
 
07:00:52.270 --> 07:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
discovered that many of the everyday
 
07:00:54.628 --> 07:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
household products they use contained
 
07:00:57.830 --> 07:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
per and polyfloral alkal substances or
 
07:01:00.628 --> 07:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
pest in addition many have discovered
 
07:01:02.548 --> 07:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
that their municipal or Community
 
07:01:04.830 --> 07:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
drinking water or private Wells have
 
07:01:06.990 --> 07:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
been contaminated with PS these
 
07:01:08.388 --> 07:01:08.398 align:start position:0%
chemicals do not break down in the
 
07:01:10.310 --> 07:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
environment and once they are in our
 
07:01:11.510 --> 07:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
body they
 
07:01:13.990 --> 07:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
accumulate even if you stop drinking
 
07:01:16.590 --> 07:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
contaminated water exposure from other
 
07:01:18.990 --> 07:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
sources continues to contribute to the
 
07:01:21.030 --> 07:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
body burden of
 
07:01:24.628 --> 07:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
pasas in addition consumers are being
 
07:01:26.788 --> 07:01:26.798 align:start position:0%
exposed to regrettable substitutions
 
07:01:29.788 --> 07:01:29.798 align:start position:0%
that are virtually untested for safety
 
07:01:31.910 --> 07:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
before they enter the market in a wide
 
07:01:35.388 --> 07:01:35.398 align:start position:0%
variety of consumer goods past chemicals
 
07:01:37.030 --> 07:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
have been found to cause a variety of
 
07:01:39.670 --> 07:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
health effects um and are linked to many
 
07:01:41.628 --> 07:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
others including testicular and kidney
 
07:01:44.230 --> 07:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
cancer ulcerative colitis thyroid
 
07:01:47.270 --> 07:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
disease hyper cholester Almia and
 
07:01:49.150 --> 07:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
pregnancy complications as well as
 
07:01:51.548 --> 07:01:51.558 align:start position:0%
female breast prostate and thyroid
 
07:01:54.150 --> 07:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
cancers low birth weight immune and
 
07:01:57.150 --> 07:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
endocrine disruption reduced childhood
 
07:02:00.750 --> 07:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine efficacy and cardiovascular
 
07:02:02.868 --> 07:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
impacts the problem has been that
 
07:02:05.590 --> 07:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
consumers have no way of knowing how to
 
07:02:07.990 --> 07:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
avoid additional exposure because the
 
07:02:10.708 --> 07:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
presence of PS is not listed on the
 
07:02:13.670 --> 07:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
label companies hide behind confidential
 
07:02:16.070 --> 07:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
business claims to avoid disclosure of
 
07:02:18.868 --> 07:02:18.878 align:start position:0%
the presence of pasas in their products
 
07:02:20.948 --> 07:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
less cancer has recently called upon the
 
07:02:23.388 --> 07:02:23.398 align:start position:0%
Food and Drug administ rtion to reain in
 
07:02:26.430 --> 07:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
this widespread use of past chemicals in
 
07:02:28.948 --> 07:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
products like waterproof mascara and
 
07:02:31.548 --> 07:02:31.558 align:start position:0%
other cosmetic products residents from
 
07:02:33.230 --> 07:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
many cities and towns across New
 
07:02:35.548 --> 07:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for example the Sea Coast in
 
07:02:38.830 --> 07:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
marac Lichfield London Terry and Bedford
 
07:02:41.548 --> 07:02:41.558 align:start position:0%
have been inadvertently exposed to high
 
07:02:43.830 --> 07:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
levels of pasas in their drinking water
 
07:02:45.430 --> 07:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
those residents can control their
 
07:02:47.150 --> 07:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
consumption of drink of contaminated
 
07:02:49.310 --> 07:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
drinking water once they knew about it
 
07:02:51.150 --> 07:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
but they cannot control additional
 
07:02:53.270 --> 07:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
inadvertent exposure from additional
 
07:02:56.230 --> 07:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
consumer products and cosmetics I fully
 
07:02:58.270 --> 07:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
support this effort with numerous
 
07:02:59.750 --> 07:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire grappling
 
07:03:01.830 --> 07:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
with the repercussions of widespread
 
07:03:04.388 --> 07:03:04.398 align:start position:0%
pasas contamination in their Drinking
 
07:03:06.670 --> 07:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
Water Supplies we must take action to
 
07:03:08.468 --> 07:03:08.478 align:start position:0%
minimize their unintended exposure to
 
07:03:11.030 --> 07:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
past chemicals um I just lastly wanted
 
07:03:14.990 --> 07:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
to mention also that on October 13
 
07:03:19.350 --> 07:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
2023 the HB 737 pest commission voted to
 
07:03:21.548 --> 07:03:21.558 align:start position:0%
support the limitation of non-essential
 
07:03:24.230 --> 07:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
use of pfast containing products in New
 
07:03:26.270 --> 07:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Commerce to ensure the
 
07:03:27.628 --> 07:03:27.638 align:start position:0%
protection of human health and the
 
07:03:29.708 --> 07:03:29.718 align:start position:0%
environment thank
 
07:03:32.708 --> 07:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you so is it possible you can
 
07:03:32.718 --> 07:03:33.670 align:start position:0%
you thank you so is it possible you can

of the committee I will uh be brief in
 
07:04:17.788 --> 07:04:17.798 align:start position:0%
the interest of the time here um I do
 
07:04:19.110 --> 07:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
have a letter of testimony that I
 
07:04:21.110 --> 07:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
provided uh for the record my name is
 
07:04:23.150 --> 07:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
Mike win that I serve as director of the
 
07:04:24.628 --> 07:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
waste management division for the New
 
07:04:26.310 --> 07:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
07:04:28.468 --> 07:04:28.478 align:start position:0%
Services I appreciate the opportunity to
 
07:04:31.788 --> 07:04:31.798 align:start position:0%
testify um on house pill 1649 this
 
07:04:34.310 --> 07:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh the agency is not taking a
 
07:04:36.190 --> 07:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
position on this um but I do want to
 
07:04:38.628 --> 07:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
offer some some guidance and some
 
07:04:41.070 --> 07:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have um first of all I
 
07:04:42.990 --> 07:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
want to say that Dees has been dealing
 
07:04:45.548 --> 07:04:45.558 align:start position:0%
ever since the discovery of uh
 
07:04:49.070 --> 07:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
contamination from p uh out at P trade
 
07:04:51.310 --> 07:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
port in 2014 and then in Southern New
 
07:04:54.948 --> 07:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 2016 DS has been working
 
07:04:56.948 --> 07:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
nothing short of feverishly to address
 
07:04:58.948 --> 07:04:58.958 align:start position:0%
the the the problems associated with
 
07:05:01.990 --> 07:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
contamination by P and to try to reduce
 
07:05:03.868 --> 07:05:03.878 align:start position:0%
human exposures to these
 
07:05:06.548 --> 07:05:06.558 align:start position:0%
toxins um we
 
07:05:11.350 --> 07:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh really determined in 2016 when we
 
07:05:13.230 --> 07:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
really began working on Earnest in this
 
07:05:15.310 --> 07:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
very quickly um we did while we were
 
07:05:16.788 --> 07:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
dealing with the problem in Southern New
 
07:05:18.670 --> 07:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we realized that we came to
 
07:05:20.788 --> 07:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
realize that Pats were very widely used
 
07:05:23.070 --> 07:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
so we we did a lot of work to evaluate
 
07:05:24.910 --> 07:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
where they might be being used and and
 
07:05:26.628 --> 07:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
released from manufacturing and
 
07:05:28.788 --> 07:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
Commercial operations and what we really
 
07:05:30.628 --> 07:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
learned is that they are so widespread
 
07:05:32.190 --> 07:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
they're in not just Industrial and
 
07:05:34.548 --> 07:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
Commercial processes but they're in um
 
07:05:37.030 --> 07:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
consumer products and so what we came to
 
07:05:38.830 --> 07:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
quickly conclude is that if we're going
 
07:05:40.990 --> 07:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
to address the human exposure problem
 
07:05:42.948 --> 07:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
we've got to significantly reduce the
 
07:05:45.628 --> 07:05:45.638 align:start position:0%
use of past in Commerce so we absolutely
 
07:05:48.150 --> 07:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
support the the intent of this bill to
 
07:05:49.868 --> 07:05:49.878 align:start position:0%
try to make steps towards that we
 
07:05:51.910 --> 07:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
believe the steps that this bill would
 
07:05:54.230 --> 07:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
Implement will will will go a long way
 
07:05:56.350 --> 07:05:56.360 align:start position:0%
towards achieving that goal of of
 
07:05:58.788 --> 07:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
reducing its use in Commerce um we do
 
07:06:00.868 --> 07:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
have some concerns about our ability to
 
07:06:03.708 --> 07:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
administer the bill as presented um and
 
07:06:05.628 --> 07:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
they may mostly Center on the fact that
 
07:06:07.548 --> 07:06:07.558 align:start position:0%
it's some pretty expansive notification
 
07:06:09.990 --> 07:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
requirements likely to involve thousands
 
07:06:12.670 --> 07:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
of products and in order to do that cost
 
07:06:14.150 --> 07:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
effectively and and really to be able to
 
07:06:15.670 --> 07:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
afford to do it and and be able to
 
07:06:17.990 --> 07:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
handle the workload associated with it
 
07:06:20.670 --> 07:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
um we believe that the use of a of a a
 
07:06:22.230 --> 07:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
multi-state clearing clearing house is
 
07:06:24.070 --> 07:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
really important for that and uh
 
07:06:26.110 --> 07:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
representative eel mentioned the ic2 I
 
07:06:27.830 --> 07:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
think that the the Interstate Chemicals
 
07:06:30.150 --> 07:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
Clearing House currently administers a
 
07:06:32.510 --> 07:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
high priority chemicals database and
 
07:06:33.910 --> 07:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
that database they're working with a
 
07:06:35.670 --> 07:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
couple of other states that are already
 
07:06:38.510 --> 07:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
have laws and they will uh likely either
 
07:06:40.590 --> 07:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
amend that or or stand up a separate
 
07:06:43.070 --> 07:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
framework to try to kind of in a in a
 
07:06:45.190 --> 07:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
Consolidated and comprehensive way serve
 
07:06:46.788 --> 07:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
multiple States who are implementing
 
07:06:48.830 --> 07:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
these programs we don't really think
 
07:06:50.788 --> 07:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
we're at the sort of critical mass state
 
07:06:52.430 --> 07:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
yet where where that'll be able to
 
07:06:53.750 --> 07:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
happen so that New Hampshire doesn't
 
07:06:55.590 --> 07:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
have to make a huge investment in
 
07:06:57.910 --> 07:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
setting up that framework so we think it
 
07:06:59.868 --> 07:06:59.878 align:start position:0%
may be that we need a little time for
 
07:07:02.468 --> 07:07:02.478 align:start position:0%
that to happen but I want to emphasize
 
07:07:04.430 --> 07:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
that we we recognize this bill is likely
 
07:07:06.830 --> 07:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
to undergo some study and we're
 
07:07:08.830 --> 07:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
certainly happy and and interested in
 
07:07:10.750 --> 07:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
participating in that discussion and
 
07:07:14.150 --> 07:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that and field any
 
07:07:16.910 --> 07:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
questions well needs to say some of our
 
07:07:18.868 --> 07:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
committee members are anxious to not
 
07:07:22.270 --> 07:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
study this anymore and move forward sure
 
07:07:25.670 --> 07:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
so um obviously I do see in the bill
 
07:07:27.750 --> 07:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
this you know the Clearing House right
 
07:07:30.868 --> 07:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
issue um so the question is then is in
 
07:07:32.750 --> 07:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the effective
 
07:07:35.590 --> 07:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
dates uh in this bill in terms of how
 
07:07:39.110 --> 07:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
working with that Clearing House model
 
07:07:41.388 --> 07:07:41.398 align:start position:0%
is is that appropriate right we have
 
07:07:44.628 --> 07:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
some sorry yeah go ahead we have some
 
07:07:47.190 --> 07:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
concerns that uh the the the pace at
 
07:07:49.070 --> 07:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
which these other few states are making
 
07:07:51.150 --> 07:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
progress is a little slow and that we
 
07:07:53.628 --> 07:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
might be in the early implementation
 
07:07:55.830 --> 07:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
phase for that and and it's just
 
07:07:57.628 --> 07:07:57.638 align:start position:0%
important to understand that that will
 
07:07:59.150 --> 07:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
take a lot more effort on the part of
 
07:08:03.110 --> 07:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
the state of of Dees as well as cost um
 
07:08:05.310 --> 07:08:05.320 align:start position:0%
having said that I think that the much
 
07:08:07.750 --> 07:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
of what the Clearing House would do for
 
07:08:10.230 --> 07:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
us would be to deal with the specific
 
07:08:12.310 --> 07:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
notification Provisions in the bill
 
07:08:13.830 --> 07:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
right so as this bill makes its way
 
07:08:15.548 --> 07:08:15.558 align:start position:0%
through if it were amended potentially
 
07:08:17.830 --> 07:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
to even remove those it's possible you
 
07:08:19.150 --> 07:08:19.160 align:start position:0%
could do this without having those
 
07:08:21.510 --> 07:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
notification requirements I'm not saying
 
07:08:22.830 --> 07:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
I'm advocating for that but it could
 
07:08:25.548 --> 07:08:25.558 align:start position:0%
happen it might change that analysis so
 
07:08:27.110 --> 07:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
I I what I'm guess I'm trying to say is
 
07:08:29.388 --> 07:08:29.398 align:start position:0%
the agency would like to be part of any
 
07:08:31.190 --> 07:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
discussions moving forward as this bill
 
07:08:32.948 --> 07:08:32.958 align:start position:0%
makes its way through the process well
 
07:08:36.990 --> 07:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
dare I say this but I I have with other
 
07:08:39.310 --> 07:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
departments that is uh yeah we would
 
07:08:42.788 --> 07:08:42.798 align:start position:0%
love to see a marked up version from
 
07:08:47.270 --> 07:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
you sure well I I I would say I'm not
 
07:08:49.388 --> 07:08:49.398 align:start position:0%
sure the agency is prepared to mark up a
 
07:08:50.868 --> 07:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
version and tell you what what would
 
07:08:53.388 --> 07:08:53.398 align:start position:0%
work for the agency but certainly we're
 
07:08:54.990 --> 07:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
prepared to work with the sponsor and
 
07:08:56.990 --> 07:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
other interested well I only say because
 
07:09:01.230 --> 07:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
you know we do insurance and Banking and
 
07:09:05.030 --> 07:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
liquor and and yeah we we is it look to
 
07:09:08.190 --> 07:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
you to be the enforcement entity and so
 
07:09:10.750 --> 07:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
therefore we yes we look for you to uh
 
07:09:12.948 --> 07:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
mark it up to tell us what you can
 
07:09:15.990 --> 07:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
enforce and when you can enforce it I'd
 
07:09:17.868 --> 07:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
be ha the agency would be happy to work
 
07:09:20.030 --> 07:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor towards that end
 
07:09:23.430 --> 07:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely EX excellent representative
 
07:09:26.030 --> 07:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
07:09:28.270 --> 07:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question could could you
 
07:09:31.830 --> 07:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
just give uh someone uh like me who's
 
07:09:34.708 --> 07:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
still studying this issue just a sense
 
07:09:37.750 --> 07:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
of I know there's hot spots in our state
 
07:09:40.990 --> 07:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
that had past contamination uh and this
 
07:09:43.110 --> 07:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
bill is talking about consumer products
 
07:09:45.788 --> 07:09:45.798 align:start position:0%
that's right um so the hotspots what
 
07:09:47.788 --> 07:09:47.798 align:start position:0%
percentage of them are from some kind of
 
07:09:50.548 --> 07:09:50.558 align:start position:0%
industrial or even military or
 
07:09:53.070 --> 07:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
firefighting Bill and which which are
 
07:09:54.990 --> 07:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
the result of landfills with consumer
 
07:09:56.708 --> 07:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
products in the landfills because that's
 
07:09:58.868 --> 07:09:58.878 align:start position:0%
what this bill would address so I I I
 
07:10:00.350 --> 07:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if I can put a number on that
 
07:10:02.590 --> 07:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
the three biggest hotpots are industrial
 
07:10:04.190 --> 07:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
or commercial so there's peace trade
 
07:10:06.190 --> 07:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
Port where was a firefighting P problem
 
07:10:08.070 --> 07:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
during the operation in the air base
 
07:10:10.070 --> 07:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's the Saco ban and the and the and
 
07:10:12.030 --> 07:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
the tox textiles coded International
 
07:10:13.788 --> 07:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
facilities in Southern New Hampshire
 
07:10:15.430 --> 07:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
that were manufacturers who had air
 
07:10:18.350 --> 07:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
emissions that impacted drinking water
 
07:10:19.788 --> 07:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
um but what we've learned through
 
07:10:21.270 --> 07:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
looking at other facilities we do have
 
07:10:23.590 --> 07:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
have a number of old online landfills
 
07:10:25.030 --> 07:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
that have contaminated groundwater
 
07:10:26.830 --> 07:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
locally as a result of the release of
 
07:10:29.628 --> 07:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
past from the landfill uh we do have a
 
07:10:33.350 --> 07:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
number of um firefighting facility or
 
07:10:35.150 --> 07:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me fire stations that that you
 
07:10:36.910 --> 07:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
know are using the materials
 
07:10:38.548 --> 07:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
appropriately but didn't know that they
 
07:10:40.030 --> 07:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
were when they were maintaining their
 
07:10:41.708 --> 07:10:41.718 align:start position:0%
equipment they were releasing
 
07:10:43.270 --> 07:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
contaminants to the area around their
 
07:10:45.350 --> 07:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
fire stations or at their fire training
 
07:10:48.150 --> 07:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
sites um but we also have examples where
 
07:10:50.468 --> 07:10:50.478 align:start position:0%
you know a carpet cleaner one person
 
07:10:52.350 --> 07:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
that works out of a van goes home at
 
07:10:54.430 --> 07:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
night to his house and dumps the wash
 
07:10:56.868 --> 07:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
waterer out and he contaminated several
 
07:11:00.150 --> 07:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
wells around his house of his neighbors
 
07:11:02.030 --> 07:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
so those are you know I would I guess
 
07:11:03.548 --> 07:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
you can call it commercial use but
 
07:11:06.270 --> 07:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
certainly similarly someone maintaining
 
07:11:08.350 --> 07:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
their own carpets or floors could
 
07:11:09.990 --> 07:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
potentially contaminate groundwater
 
07:11:13.468 --> 07:11:13.478 align:start position:0%
around their home so we do see p in many
 
07:11:16.670 --> 07:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
different locations um in terms of the
 
07:11:18.830 --> 07:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
use in consumer products it isn't just
 
07:11:21.510 --> 07:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
about contaminating groundwater it's
 
07:11:23.628 --> 07:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
that these exposures occur as a result
 
07:11:26.430 --> 07:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
of you know Cosmetics um getting into
 
07:11:30.270 --> 07:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
food and ingesting it um household dust
 
07:11:32.070 --> 07:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
um that sort of thing so the the the
 
07:11:34.990 --> 07:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
path the pathways to exposure are are
 
07:11:42.030 --> 07:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:45.230 --> 07:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
water great well we look forward to be
 
07:11:46.910 --> 07:11:46.920 align:start position:0%

07:11:53.270 --> 07:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
do is I'm going to do the two uh cards I
 
07:11:55.070 --> 07:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
have in opposition just to get them out
 
07:11:57.388 --> 07:11:57.398 align:start position:0%
of the way and then we can take up the
 
07:12:00.990 --> 07:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
rest of it so jod rimus representing the

07:12:37.070 --> 07:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
presented a letter for you all to have
 
07:12:38.830 --> 07:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
it is signed by not only the American
 
07:12:41.510 --> 07:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
chemistry Council but a number of other
 
07:12:42.948 --> 07:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
industries that have also raised
 
07:12:46.110 --> 07:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
concerns about the bill as written um we
 
07:12:48.310 --> 07:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
have had uh very good conversations with
 
07:12:48.320 --> 07:12:49.948 align:start position:0%
have had uh very good conversations with

sponsor Before Christmas um we'd like to
 
07:13:05.510 --> 07:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
continue those discussions um certainly
 
07:13:07.150 --> 07:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
um the American chemistry Council has
 
07:13:10.110 --> 07:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
released its own model legislation which
 
07:13:11.948 --> 07:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
covers a lot of these products as well
 
07:13:14.110 --> 07:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
so trying to work through those things I
 
07:13:15.788 --> 07:13:15.798 align:start position:0%
will tell you as the sponsor mentioned
 
07:13:17.388 --> 07:13:17.398 align:start position:0%
years ago there was an issue of of
 
07:13:20.270 --> 07:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
firefighting Foams in 2019 we worked
 
07:13:21.910 --> 07:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
with Senator Tom Tom Sherman and all of
 
07:13:23.230 --> 07:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders including the
 
07:13:24.830 --> 07:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters to come up
 
07:13:26.270 --> 07:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
with the statute that's on this books
 
07:13:27.868 --> 07:13:27.878 align:start position:0%
today so we'd like to have that
 
07:13:29.270 --> 07:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity we will continue to work
 
07:13:31.230 --> 07:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
with the subcommittee and the sponsor to
 
07:13:33.030 --> 07:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
see if we can find some way to find
 
07:13:35.990 --> 07:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
consensus thank you so is it over the
 
07:13:37.990 --> 07:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
polymer issue uh there's some
 
07:13:39.548 --> 07:13:39.558 align:start position:0%
definitional issues that they'd like to
 
07:13:40.670 --> 07:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
discuss I think they also want to
 
07:13:42.468 --> 07:13:42.478 align:start position:0%
discuss kind of those notifications and
 
07:13:44.750 --> 07:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
U timing requirements as well different
 
07:13:48.548 --> 07:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
Industries have different um okay issues
 
07:13:51.430 --> 07:13:51.440 align:start position:0%

for short we're a coalition of past
 
07:14:27.030 --> 07:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
users and producers who are committed to
 
07:14:29.388 --> 07:14:29.398 align:start position:0%
sustainable risk-based past management
 
07:14:31.510 --> 07:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
our members advocate for responsible
 
07:14:33.230 --> 07:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
policies that assure long-term human
 
07:14:35.430 --> 07:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
health and Environmental Protection uh
 
07:14:37.030 --> 07:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
while recognizing the critical need that
 
07:14:39.510 --> 07:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
certain past play as contributors to US
 
07:14:42.150 --> 07:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
economic growth so that's a summary of
 
07:14:44.670 --> 07:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
of who we are um very happy to be here
 
07:14:46.788 --> 07:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
today we've been involved in the past
 
07:14:48.270 --> 07:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
discussion in New Hampshire for going on
 
07:14:50.468 --> 07:14:50.478 align:start position:0%
a couple of years now and I'll I'll just
 
07:14:52.628 --> 07:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
begin by saying we've had some very
 
07:14:54.510 --> 07:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
productive conversations and continuing
 
07:14:56.708 --> 07:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
dialogue with um some of the members
 
07:15:00.190 --> 07:15:00.200 align:start position:0%
here um and others um like Dees and we
 
07:15:01.990 --> 07:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
very very much look forward to that
 
07:15:05.070 --> 07:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
continuing today um I'll just be brief
 
07:15:07.030 --> 07:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of issues to to mention
 
07:15:09.270 --> 07:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
here quickly today uh We've touched on a
 
07:15:12.150 --> 07:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
couple of issues with um the definition
 
07:15:14.110 --> 07:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
uh and we would like to say to begin
 
07:15:15.628 --> 07:15:15.638 align:start position:0%
that there are aspects of the bill that
 
07:15:18.030 --> 07:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
we are supportive of um and we'll touch
 
07:15:20.310 --> 07:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
on those briefly as well um with the
 
07:15:23.270 --> 07:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
definition we'll just say briefly that
 
07:15:25.510 --> 07:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
um as has been mentioned the definition
 
07:15:28.388 --> 07:15:28.398 align:start position:0%
is uh far too broad um there would be
 
07:15:31.030 --> 07:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
about 14,000 compounds included in the
 
07:15:33.990 --> 07:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
legislation's current definition um just
 
07:15:36.910 --> 07:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
to give a little bit of um reference to
 
07:15:39.350 --> 07:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
that definition uh recently the US
 
07:15:41.830 --> 07:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency released
 
07:15:44.548 --> 07:15:44.558 align:start position:0%
final rules for a past reporting program
 
07:15:47.590 --> 07:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
pursuant to epa's past road map that
 
07:15:48.830 --> 07:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
they released in
 
07:15:52.350 --> 07:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
2021 um the definition that they use um
 
07:15:55.510 --> 07:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
EPA States contains uh less than 1,500
 
07:15:57.830 --> 07:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
compounds of which less than 800 are
 
07:16:00.670 --> 07:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
expected to be commercially active um
 
07:16:02.830 --> 07:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
and so it's important to consider and in
 
07:16:04.468 --> 07:16:04.478 align:start position:0%
other states as well such as Delaware
 
07:16:06.430 --> 07:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
Virginia and West Virginia have also
 
07:16:09.548 --> 07:16:09.558 align:start position:0%
adopted more uh targeted definitions so
 
07:16:12.310 --> 07:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
um span would consider uh or encourage
 
07:16:14.430 --> 07:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
consideration of those federal reporting
 
07:16:16.030 --> 07:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
rules and some of the other factors that
 
07:16:18.750 --> 07:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
go into the definition as well um we'll
 
07:16:21.070 --> 07:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
also just touch on briefly as I
 
07:16:22.590 --> 07:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned span is supportive of the
 
07:16:25.510 --> 07:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
Bill's focus on consumer products um it
 
07:16:28.030 --> 07:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
is very important that past legislation
 
07:16:30.388 --> 07:16:30.398 align:start position:0%
focus on non-essential consumer product
 
07:16:32.628 --> 07:16:32.638 align:start position:0%
uses especially in some uses in which
 
07:16:34.350 --> 07:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
the pasas can be phased out so we
 
07:16:36.788 --> 07:16:36.798 align:start position:0%
applaud the Bill's focus on that uh we
 
07:16:38.590 --> 07:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
would like to emphasize though that the
 
07:16:41.388 --> 07:16:41.398 align:start position:0%
bill um or bills focused on consumer
 
07:16:43.150 --> 07:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
products are most effective when the
 
07:16:45.708 --> 07:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
definition is targeted to high risk and
 
07:16:47.948 --> 07:16:47.958 align:start position:0%
high emissive compounds that are
 
07:16:50.948 --> 07:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
commercially active as well so um those
 
07:16:53.708 --> 07:16:53.718 align:start position:0%
are my my comments I'll keep it brief um
 
07:16:54.990 --> 07:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for the time
 
07:16:57.110 --> 07:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
today there's any comments or questions
 
07:16:59.708 --> 07:16:59.718 align:start position:0%
I will be happy to take them all right
 
07:17:02.230 --> 07:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you question representative Spirit
 
07:17:02.240 --> 07:17:03.150 align:start position:0%
thank you question representative Spirit
we've

07:17:03.150 --> 07:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
we've
 
07:17:06.430 --> 07:17:06.440 align:start position:0%
talked we have yes we've talked in the
 
07:17:09.548 --> 07:17:09.558 align:start position:0%
past and the problem that we have with
 
07:17:12.230 --> 07:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
limiting the
 
07:17:14.430 --> 07:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
definition is that the products it's
 
07:17:16.910 --> 07:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
like playing whack-a-mole every time we
 
07:17:19.430 --> 07:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
turn around there's another product and
 
07:17:21.190 --> 07:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the breakdown product
 
07:17:23.910 --> 07:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
is if we start limiting the
 
07:17:26.350 --> 07:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
definition we're afraid we're going to
 
07:17:29.030 --> 07:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
miss what it is we're trying to protect
 
07:17:29.040 --> 07:17:30.350 align:start position:0%
miss what it is we're trying to protect
over

07:17:30.350 --> 07:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
over
 
07:17:34.590 --> 07:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
here and one of the things that that one
 
07:17:36.430 --> 07:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
of the most immediate things is the
 
07:17:39.030 --> 07:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
compounds that make up uh
 
07:17:41.030 --> 07:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
hfos the fact that they're using
 
07:17:43.788 --> 07:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
Refrigeration fine the fact that they
 
07:17:46.868 --> 07:17:46.878 align:start position:0%
using industrial places fine they don't
 
07:17:49.150 --> 07:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
belong on our hair because they break
 
07:17:52.030 --> 07:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
down and the breakdown products are bad
 
07:17:56.190 --> 07:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
so it's very very difficult to to narrow
 
07:17:59.270 --> 07:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
that um that
 
07:18:01.548 --> 07:18:01.558 align:start position:0%
definition and the
 
07:18:04.110 --> 07:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
EPA has been
 
07:18:06.110 --> 07:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
driven has had taken a lot of
 
07:18:08.708 --> 07:18:08.718 align:start position:0%
information from the industry and they
 
07:18:11.628 --> 07:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
haven't really they they've narrowed it
 
07:18:13.628 --> 07:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
to such an extent that we don't know
 
07:18:16.310 --> 07:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
where to go with that definition to
 
07:18:18.910 --> 07:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
protect ourselves into the future so why
 
07:18:21.110 --> 07:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
do you think we should do that that I'm
 
07:18:25.230 --> 07:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
not clear on what the benefit of that is
 
07:18:27.190 --> 07:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
when all we're concerned about our
 
07:18:29.548 --> 07:18:29.558 align:start position:0%
consumer products which we don't even
 
07:18:31.910 --> 07:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
know what's in them and and we've talked
 
07:18:33.670 --> 07:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
about trying to get the definitions for
 
07:18:36.230 --> 07:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
what's in them and we can't sure all
 
07:18:37.990 --> 07:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative spe thank you for the
 
07:18:39.548 --> 07:18:39.558 align:start position:0%
comments and the question I appreciate
 
07:18:42.510 --> 07:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
that um we'll say quickly some of the
 
07:18:45.110 --> 07:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
products in the bill like food packaging
 
07:18:47.430 --> 07:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
um the past content is relatively well
 
07:18:50.030 --> 07:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
understood that one is right and we
 
07:18:52.430 --> 07:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
applaud the bills focus on that and I I
 
07:18:55.070 --> 07:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
will also comment that part of the
 
07:18:56.910 --> 07:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
purpose of the epa's reporting rules is
 
07:18:59.070 --> 07:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
to address exactly what you've mentioned
 
07:19:00.830 --> 07:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
is certainly and a lot of compounds that
 
07:19:02.708 --> 07:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
have entered Commerce in the last
 
07:19:04.510 --> 07:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
several years or so have undergone
 
07:19:06.830 --> 07:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
pretty rigorous toxical testing at the
 
07:19:09.388 --> 07:19:09.398 align:start position:0%
federal level um but others have not and
 
07:19:11.030 --> 07:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
part of the purpose of the EPA reporting
 
07:19:13.670 --> 07:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
rules is to figure out which ones have
 
07:19:15.708 --> 07:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
not which ones are commercially active
 
07:19:17.230 --> 07:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
which ones might be responsible for the
 
07:19:19.830 --> 07:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
contamination issues so agreed there are
 
07:19:21.670 --> 07:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
holes in the research and that is
 
07:19:24.270 --> 07:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
ongoing um and we look forward to that
 
07:19:26.270 --> 07:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
data from EPA and would just encourage
 
07:19:28.110 --> 07:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
that the committee consider that when it
 
07:19:28.120 --> 07:19:30.030 align:start position:0%
that the committee consider that when it
becomes

07:19:30.030 --> 07:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
07:19:32.948 --> 07:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
available any other questions
 
07:19:34.868 --> 07:19:34.878 align:start position:0%
representative Bilo thank you thank you
 
07:19:36.548 --> 07:19:36.558 align:start position:0%
for taking my question do you think
 
07:19:40.150 --> 07:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
there's a problem here with pasas in the
 
07:19:40.160 --> 07:19:41.830 align:start position:0%
there's a problem here with pasas in the
state

07:19:41.830 --> 07:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:19:44.510 --> 07:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely that mean yeah we acknowledge
 
07:19:46.670 --> 07:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
that there are issues with past
 
07:19:48.830 --> 07:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
contamination and that's part of what
 
07:19:50.868 --> 07:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
our group is intending to do
 
07:19:52.830 --> 07:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
is focus on identifying contaminated
 
07:19:55.708 --> 07:19:55.718 align:start position:0%
sites and remediating
 
07:19:58.150 --> 07:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
them right thank you all right any other
 
07:20:00.230 --> 07:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
07:20:01.830 --> 07:20:01.840 align:start position:0%

07:22:03.708 --> 07:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
you to uh support this bill and vote uh
 
07:22:04.788 --> 07:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
07:22:07.150 --> 07:22:07.160 align:start position:0%
pass thank you for protecting the health
 
07:22:09.670 --> 07:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
of our community that's it all right
 
07:22:10.948 --> 07:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
07:22:13.190 --> 07:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
07:22:15.788 --> 07:22:15.798 align:start position:0%
guest all right thank
 
07:22:19.150 --> 07:22:19.160 align:start position:0%

pug pugy py uh from representing WM if
 
07:22:29.628 --> 07:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:31.910 --> 07:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon members of the
 
07:22:34.350 --> 07:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Steve py I am
 
07:22:35.948 --> 07:22:35.958 align:start position:0%
the uh area director of disposal
 
07:22:39.030 --> 07:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
operations for Waste Management uh I'm a
 
07:22:40.350 --> 07:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
professional engineer registered in
 
07:22:41.750 --> 07:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I've been dealing
 
07:22:43.670 --> 07:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
with solid waste management issues for
 
07:22:46.388 --> 07:22:46.398 align:start position:0%
more than 40 years uh most of that in
 
07:22:48.350 --> 07:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire uh we
 
07:22:50.750 --> 07:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
currently operate the turnkey land in
 
07:22:55.628 --> 07:22:55.638 align:start position:0%
Rochester it's um the larest landfill in
 
07:22:59.628 --> 07:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
the State uh we manage about 40% of the
 
07:23:01.388 --> 07:23:01.398 align:start position:0%
solid waste that's currently generated
 
07:23:03.708 --> 07:23:03.718 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire uh so
 
07:23:06.868 --> 07:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
we're the recipient of a lot of solid
 
07:23:10.070 --> 07:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
waste that gets generated in the state
 
07:23:14.110 --> 07:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
and we are managing lee8 coming off the
 
07:23:15.468 --> 07:23:15.478 align:start position:0%
bottom of that landfill we've got a
 
07:23:18.388 --> 07:23:18.398 align:start position:0%
double lined landfill there and we have
 
07:23:20.910 --> 07:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
a pre-treatment facility onite site that
 
07:23:23.030 --> 07:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
we treat for these compounds along with
 
07:23:25.628 --> 07:23:25.638 align:start position:0%
a number of other things we haven't been
 
07:23:28.190 --> 07:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
required to do that um by the
 
07:23:30.110 --> 07:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
regulations yet but we know they're
 
07:23:33.030 --> 07:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
coming so we've gone ahead and put in a
 
07:23:36.270 --> 07:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh reverse osmosis treatment system and
 
07:23:38.948 --> 07:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh recently an iron exchange system to
 
07:23:40.670 --> 07:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
remove these chemicals from the
 
07:23:43.308 --> 07:23:43.318 align:start position:0%
Wastewater before it gets discharged to
 
07:23:44.788 --> 07:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
the city of Rochester where they treat
 
07:23:47.830 --> 07:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
it again um we're in support of this
 
07:23:51.190 --> 07:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
bill uh we think that there needs to be
 
07:23:55.030 --> 07:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
something done to remove these compounds
 
07:23:57.750 --> 07:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh from the waist stream uh they're
 
07:23:59.388 --> 07:23:59.398 align:start position:0%
extremely hazardous and you heard
 
07:24:02.230 --> 07:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
testimony today uh and if you look at
 
07:24:05.990 --> 07:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
the research it's pretty compelling um
 
07:24:07.590 --> 07:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
just looking at the standards that are
 
07:24:09.948 --> 07:24:09.958 align:start position:0%
being proposed by EPA for drinking water
 
07:24:12.548 --> 07:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
that's coming out fairly soon uh it's
 
07:24:14.510 --> 07:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to be the pop P trillion range
 
07:24:16.868 --> 07:24:16.878 align:start position:0%
limits are often set in pot per million
 
07:24:19.708 --> 07:24:19.718 align:start position:0%
pot per billion pot per trillion I can't
 
07:24:21.190 --> 07:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
think of of any other compounds that are
 
07:24:23.670 --> 07:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
set the PO patran range to give you some
 
07:24:26.750 --> 07:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
context on that I just looked up sitting
 
07:24:30.430 --> 07:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
here how much waterers in Lake wazaki
 
07:24:35.110 --> 07:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
625 billion gallons so if you took I did
 
07:24:38.230 --> 07:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
the quick math cup and a half of these
 
07:24:41.750 --> 07:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
compounds poured into when it Baki you
 
07:24:43.868 --> 07:24:43.878 align:start position:0%
couldn't drink the
 
07:24:46.910 --> 07:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
water and if you look at things that are
 
07:24:49.230 --> 07:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
under your kitchen sink which I did my
 
07:24:52.270 --> 07:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
wife had result carpet cleaner and you
 
07:24:55.350 --> 07:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
look that up majority of that is
 
07:24:59.590 --> 07:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
past and that 16 o container which is
 
07:25:01.230 --> 07:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
you know sold and available at Lowe's
 
07:25:01.240 --> 07:25:02.350 align:start position:0%
you know sold and available at Lowe's
for

07:25:02.350 --> 07:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:25:05.590 --> 07:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
$7.98 a container you pour that in wiip
 
07:25:07.788 --> 07:25:07.798 align:start position:0%
 you can't drink that water so these
 
07:25:10.788 --> 07:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
things are extremely hazardous uh very
 
07:25:13.350 --> 07:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
costly we spent millions of dollars over
 
07:25:15.868 --> 07:25:15.878 align:start position:0%
the last five years to manage these
 
07:25:17.430 --> 07:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
chemicals and I can tell you they're in
 
07:25:21.670 --> 07:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
everything we we do um we manage uh as
 
07:25:24.510 --> 07:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
individuals what we buy in the stores uh
 
07:25:27.590 --> 07:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
what we discard so I would uh really
 
07:25:29.230 --> 07:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to to move this
 
07:25:31.468 --> 07:25:31.478 align:start position:0%
forward and look to try to eliminate
 
07:25:36.070 --> 07:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:38.510 --> 07:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
you representative buroughs thanks for
 
07:25:40.468 --> 07:25:40.478 align:start position:0%
taking my question just a quick question
 
07:25:41.910 --> 07:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
I was just kind of startled when you
 
07:25:43.670 --> 07:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
said that that I don't know what the
 
07:25:45.150 --> 07:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
name of the the product was that you
 
07:25:48.030 --> 07:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
pour down the drain resolve it's stains
 
07:25:49.510 --> 07:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
on your carpet yep Resolve Carpet
 
07:25:51.350 --> 07:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
Cleaner what does that do to people who
 
07:25:53.270 --> 07:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
living in the house when you use that
 
07:25:56.350 --> 07:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:58.708 --> 07:25:58.718 align:start position:0%
it is resolve this is the one with the
 
07:26:01.110 --> 07:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
red jar with with the brush thing on top
 
07:26:02.590 --> 07:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
I use that all the time right and we a
 
07:26:04.190 --> 07:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
lot of us have it it works great I will
 
07:26:06.230 --> 07:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
tell you that the materials work great
 
07:26:07.388 --> 07:26:07.398 align:start position:0%
for what they're intended but they're
 
07:26:09.990 --> 07:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
extremely hazardous and we we have them
 
07:26:12.190 --> 07:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
everywhere so that's not on the list
 
07:26:13.990 --> 07:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
maybe representative evil will consider
 
07:26:15.948 --> 07:26:15.958 align:start position:0%
that but there are a lot of things that
 
07:26:17.350 --> 07:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
could be added to that list I think it's
 
07:26:20.110 --> 07:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
a good start um is that the pet cleaner
 
07:26:21.830 --> 07:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
no it's a fabric cleaner it's a rug it's
 
07:26:23.788 --> 07:26:23.798 align:start position:0%
a rug cleaner yeah and just on that real
 
07:26:27.308 --> 07:26:27.318 align:start position:0%
quick um carpets and uh Furniture are a
 
07:26:28.868 --> 07:26:28.878 align:start position:0%
problem for us we take those materials
 
07:26:31.270 --> 07:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
for disposal obviously but uh stain
 
07:26:33.910 --> 07:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
Master that's what that is yeah um works
 
07:26:36.948 --> 07:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
great but in bulk we there's a lot of
 
07:26:38.388 --> 07:26:38.398 align:start position:0%
material that comes into these sites for
 
07:26:40.270 --> 07:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
disposal we're managing it on the back
 
07:26:45.468 --> 07:26:45.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:51.670 --> 07:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you thank you uh d
 
07:27:02.150 --> 07:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:04.910 --> 07:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
District good evening I appreciate you
 
07:27:06.670 --> 07:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh having us here tonight my name is
 
07:27:08.990 --> 07:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
Donald preventure I'm a civil engineer I
 
07:27:12.110 --> 07:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
am the um chair of the meramac village
 
07:27:13.388 --> 07:27:13.398 align:start position:0%
District Board of
 
07:27:18.708 --> 07:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um the MVD is a uh water
 
07:27:20.990 --> 07:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
district that supplies water water to uh
 
07:27:25.308 --> 07:27:25.318 align:start position:0%
meramac in portion of Bedford um we know
 
07:27:30.150 --> 07:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
firsthand the challenges of past um all
 
07:27:32.070 --> 07:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
of our wells all of our six wells in
 
07:27:34.150 --> 07:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
town are contaminated we've got three
 
07:27:36.670 --> 07:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
treatment plants that treat those six
 
07:27:41.548 --> 07:27:41.558 align:start position:0%
Wells uh it was uh at least uh $20
 
07:27:43.708 --> 07:27:43.718 align:start position:0%
million worth of pasas
 
07:27:47.548 --> 07:27:47.558 align:start position:0%
treatment um our customers fund MVD
 
07:27:49.350 --> 07:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
fully they're on the hook for that 20
 
07:27:49.360 --> 07:27:50.190 align:start position:0%
fully they're on the hook for that 20
million

07:27:50.190 --> 07:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
million
 
07:27:52.548 --> 07:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
over the next 20 years
 
07:27:55.708 --> 07:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
basically um I have a letter that I
 
07:27:57.910 --> 07:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
submitted to you on record already it's
 
07:28:00.110 --> 07:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
signed by all five of our Board of
 
07:28:02.150 --> 07:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I've got one behind me
 
07:28:05.230 --> 07:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
wolf Von Shan that that joined me today
 
07:28:06.788 --> 07:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
and the uh
 
07:28:09.388 --> 07:28:09.398 align:start position:0%
superintendent um but the one thing I I
 
07:28:10.788 --> 07:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention is this very
 
07:28:15.548 --> 07:28:15.558 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2019 passed some very low
 
07:28:18.430 --> 07:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
uh maximum contaminant levels for uh
 
07:28:21.388 --> 07:28:21.398 align:start position:0%
Four Past comp compounds those are very
 
07:28:21.398 --> 07:28:22.708 align:start position:0%
Four Past comp compounds those are very
low

07:28:22.708 --> 07:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
low
 
07:28:25.110 --> 07:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
concentrations um the reason that
 
07:28:27.670 --> 07:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
they're that low is because of their
 
07:28:31.750 --> 07:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
toxicity um that is a main root of uh
 
07:28:34.430 --> 07:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
exposure is obviously drinking peat uh
 
07:28:38.948 --> 07:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
water because everybody needs water um
 
07:28:41.708 --> 07:28:41.718 align:start position:0%
but in my mind uh
 
07:28:44.910 --> 07:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
having those levels Solo in this
 
07:28:48.510 --> 07:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
legislature taking the responsibility
 
07:28:52.270 --> 07:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
of creating those mcls at that low
 
07:28:55.788 --> 07:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
level it's it's common sense that any
 
07:28:58.308 --> 07:28:58.318 align:start position:0%
other roots of exposure should be
 
07:29:00.430 --> 07:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
treated as well and I think this bill
 
07:29:03.948 --> 07:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
addresses a lot of that
 
07:29:07.308 --> 07:29:07.318 align:start position:0%
um in meramac there's something that I I
 
07:29:11.070 --> 07:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
dubbed the uh the P Trifecta for those
 
07:29:14.230 --> 07:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
of you who think that um not all past
 
07:29:17.750 --> 07:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
may be um harmful but um we have one of
 
07:29:20.230 --> 07:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
the largest polluters in town
 
07:29:23.430 --> 07:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's number one probably the
 
07:29:25.510 --> 07:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
largest polluter in all of New England
 
07:29:28.350 --> 07:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
if not the whole country or one of the
 
07:29:32.990 --> 07:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
largest in the country uh in 2017 the
 
07:29:34.510 --> 07:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
07:29:36.628 --> 07:29:36.638 align:start position:0%
tested the blood of
 
07:29:40.190 --> 07:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
217 uh MVD customers and found the
 
07:29:41.830 --> 07:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
average customer to have double the
 
07:29:44.750 --> 07:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
national average of pfoa and then just
 
07:29:48.830 --> 07:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
recently in uh January of 23 a year ago
 
07:29:51.350 --> 07:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
dhh came out with a cancer study that
 
07:29:51.360 --> 07:29:52.910 align:start position:0%
dhh came out with a cancer study that
indicated

07:29:52.910 --> 07:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
07:29:56.628 --> 07:29:56.638 align:start position:0%
42% higher occurrence of um kidney and
 
07:29:59.070 --> 07:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
and bladder cancer in miramac than
 
07:30:01.468 --> 07:30:01.478 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in the state so when you
 
07:30:03.230 --> 07:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
add those three together I find it hard
 
07:30:06.468 --> 07:30:06.478 align:start position:0%
that it's a coincidence so um these
 
07:30:08.110 --> 07:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
things are important they need to be
 
07:30:11.270 --> 07:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
dealt with um and I think it's time
 
07:30:13.990 --> 07:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
maybe to have the chemical industry
 
07:30:15.270 --> 07:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
instead of us having to play the
 
07:30:16.788 --> 07:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
whack-a-mole approach why don't we have
 
07:30:18.948 --> 07:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
the chemical industry prove that past
 
07:30:20.230 --> 07:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
are safe
 
07:30:21.868 --> 07:30:21.878 align:start position:0%
before we let them back into our
 
07:30:24.708 --> 07:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
consumer products and I think putting a
 
07:30:27.110 --> 07:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
pressing the pause button on that right
 
07:30:29.590 --> 07:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
now is an appropriate thing to do so
 
07:30:31.308 --> 07:30:31.318 align:start position:0%
that was it I wanted to keep it brief
 
07:30:32.708 --> 07:30:32.718 align:start position:0%
there's more information in the letter
 
07:30:34.868 --> 07:30:34.878 align:start position:0%
that I sent you but you have that so you
 
07:30:36.150 --> 07:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
can read it at your own Leisure
 
07:30:36.160 --> 07:30:37.788 align:start position:0%
can read it at your own Leisure
appreciate

07:30:37.788 --> 07:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
07:30:37.798 --> 07:30:40.230 align:start position:0%
appreciate
it

07:30:40.230 --> 07:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:30:42.388 --> 07:30:42.398 align:start position:0%
yeah could you tell me I don't know if
 
07:30:45.150 --> 07:30:45.160 align:start position:0%
you can but if um my girlfriend lives in
 
07:30:47.468 --> 07:30:47.478 align:start position:0%
Bedford right across the street from uh
 
07:30:50.030 --> 07:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
the Manchester Country Club and
 
07:30:53.750 --> 07:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
and her well is polluted with P so she
 
07:30:56.788 --> 07:30:56.798 align:start position:0%
hasn't been able to drink the water and
 
07:30:58.230 --> 07:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
could you tell me if the Manchester
 
07:31:01.708 --> 07:31:01.718 align:start position:0%
Country Club is dealing with P issues or
 
07:31:03.110 --> 07:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
if they even
 
07:31:05.910 --> 07:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
know I don't know if they know or if
 
07:31:09.150 --> 07:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with that um I will say
 
07:31:11.030 --> 07:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's a groundwater management Zone
 
07:31:14.948 --> 07:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
delineation that goes as far as into
 
07:31:17.830 --> 07:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
Southern Manchester which is where I
 
07:31:19.910 --> 07:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
grew up and then I moved to meramac so
 
07:31:21.468 --> 07:31:21.478 align:start position:0%
I'm personally Liv my whole life in a
 
07:31:24.590 --> 07:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
groundwater management Zone um but I
 
07:31:26.910 --> 07:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
know meramac Village District doesn't
 
07:31:28.830 --> 07:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
serve water to that part of
 
07:31:31.708 --> 07:31:31.718 align:start position:0%
Bedford um but it it is inside the
 
07:31:34.708 --> 07:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
groundwater management zone so there's
 
07:31:37.868 --> 07:31:37.878 align:start position:0%
there's a good a chance that all of uh
 
07:31:39.270 --> 07:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
the groundwater in there should be
 
07:31:42.190 --> 07:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
tested within that boundary and uh it's
 
07:31:45.110 --> 07:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
not surprising to me that it's found if
 
07:31:48.070 --> 07:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
it is elevated it's not surprising yep
 
07:31:50.910 --> 07:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:31:55.948 --> 07:31:55.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:59.110 --> 07:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
Strand you had to leave
 
07:32:03.830 --> 07:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh Christine uh babber she's left
 
07:32:03.840 --> 07:32:05.190 align:start position:0%
okay uh Christine uh babber she's left
yeah

07:32:05.190 --> 07:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:32:09.548 --> 07:32:09.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:14.510 --> 07:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:17.190 --> 07:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
Heidi I know she's constellation V are
 
07:32:18.990 --> 07:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
you from around here or are you from uh

me
 
07:32:22.110 --> 07:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm with clf in our conquered office
 
07:32:23.388 --> 07:32:23.398 align:start position:0%
and I'm from the Upper Valley from
 
07:32:25.590 --> 07:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
Handover okay so aren't you glad we
 
07:32:27.590 --> 07:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
scheduled all these bills today well I
 
07:32:28.990 --> 07:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
hear the snow has started up in the
 
07:32:30.990 --> 07:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
Upper Valley so I will be driving there
 
07:32:33.788 --> 07:32:33.798 align:start position:0%
uh next heading home but uh thank you
 
07:32:35.510 --> 07:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
good evening thank you to the chair in
 
07:32:38.030 --> 07:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
the committee um for my third appearance
 
07:32:41.270 --> 07:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
I will keep it brief um for the record
 
07:32:43.670 --> 07:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
Heidi trarco for the conservation law
 
07:32:47.388 --> 07:32:47.398 align:start position:0%
Foundation um I will start by uh I have
 
07:32:49.788 --> 07:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
testimony from
 
07:32:52.910 --> 07:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh a group of organizations that um had
 
07:32:54.750 --> 07:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
to leave early they have submitted a
 
07:32:57.190 --> 07:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
letter um but this is testimony and
 
07:32:59.030 --> 07:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
support of the bill from the New
 
07:33:00.708 --> 07:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of conservation
 
07:33:02.430 --> 07:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
commissions the Appalachian Mountain
 
07:33:05.430 --> 07:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
Club New Hampshire audabon the forest
 
07:33:08.110 --> 07:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
Society Connecticut River Conservancy
 
07:33:10.750 --> 07:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes collaborative Solid
 
07:33:12.590 --> 07:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
Waste strategies and the nature
 
07:33:14.230 --> 07:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
conservancy and all of those
 
07:33:16.308 --> 07:33:16.318 align:start position:0%
organizations support the bill and urge
 
07:33:18.070 --> 07:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote ought to pass and
 
07:33:20.150 --> 07:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
you should have their
 
07:33:22.868 --> 07:33:22.878 align:start position:0%
um testimony with uh the committee
 
07:33:25.150 --> 07:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
should already have
 
07:33:28.350 --> 07:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
that um they speak to pfas being
 
07:33:30.548 --> 07:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
widespread harmful to human health and
 
07:33:33.868 --> 07:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
the environment the high costs of pasas
 
07:33:37.590 --> 07:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
pollution and the need to reduce P to
 
07:33:40.990 --> 07:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
avoid the harm and start solving the
 
07:33:44.350 --> 07:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
pfas crisis that we face um similarly
 
07:33:46.230 --> 07:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
the committee should have clf's
 
07:33:47.788 --> 07:33:47.798 align:start position:0%
testimony and I have copies and I'll
 
07:33:50.510 --> 07:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
hand those out um but we strongly urge
 
07:33:54.070 --> 07:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
the committee to um vote a to pass on
 
07:33:55.708 --> 07:33:55.718 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:33:59.308 --> 07:33:59.318 align:start position:0%
1649 um and I will you'll just find in
 
07:34:01.670 --> 07:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
our testimony hopefully some of the
 
07:34:04.308 --> 07:34:04.318 align:start position:0%
references that provides the committee
 
07:34:06.308 --> 07:34:06.318 align:start position:0%
um with some of the documentation to
 
07:34:08.270 --> 07:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
support things that you've already heard
 
07:34:10.750 --> 07:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
today about the high costs of PS
 
07:34:13.590 --> 07:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
contamination the serious health health
 
07:34:17.628 --> 07:34:17.638 align:start position:0%
effects um and you know the
 
07:34:20.590 --> 07:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
pervasiveness of pest in our bodies and
 
07:34:21.670 --> 07:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
in our
 
07:34:24.868 --> 07:34:24.878 align:start position:0%
environment and I'll just um close on a
 
07:34:27.190 --> 07:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
personal note I began my career as an
 
07:34:29.510 --> 07:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
attorney 15 years ago representing
 
07:34:31.868 --> 07:34:31.878 align:start position:0%
people a a class of people whose
 
07:34:34.830 --> 07:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
drinking water was contaminated by P and
 
07:34:37.548 --> 07:34:37.558 align:start position:0%
pfoa in um West Virginia and in
 
07:34:40.308 --> 07:34:40.318 align:start position:0%
Minnesota and in New Jersey and at the
 
07:34:43.510 --> 07:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
time it was um we were just discovering
 
07:34:45.350 --> 07:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
these these things and trying to figure
 
07:34:47.230 --> 07:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
out what they were and learning that the
 
07:34:48.830 --> 07:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
companies had known about them as you've
 
07:34:48.840 --> 07:34:49.548 align:start position:0%
companies had known about them as you've
heard

07:34:49.548 --> 07:34:49.558 align:start position:0%
heard
 
07:34:51.430 --> 07:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
from worker studies you know for decades
 
07:34:53.750 --> 07:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe since the 1940s since the
 
07:34:56.830 --> 07:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
1970s and so we were discovering it then
 
07:34:59.548 --> 07:34:59.558 align:start position:0%
um and it it is exciting that New
 
07:35:01.708 --> 07:35:01.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has an opportunity to um not
 
07:35:03.750 --> 07:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
just react but to take a positive step
 
07:35:06.070 --> 07:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
towards protecting people and protecting
 
07:35:08.750 --> 07:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
the state from these chemicals so I urge
 
07:35:11.230 --> 07:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote out to pass thank
 
07:35:13.230 --> 07:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
07:35:15.750 --> 07:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
you safe drive
 
07:35:24.868 --> 07:35:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:30.670 --> 07:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:33.750 --> 07:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
right hi I actually filled out the pink
 
07:35:35.590 --> 07:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
card that I was going to speak for Susan
 
07:35:37.750 --> 07:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
Richmond who couldn't be here right
 
07:35:40.230 --> 07:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
instead I turned in her uh short
 
07:35:42.830 --> 07:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
testimony to you already yes so you have
 
07:35:45.270 --> 07:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
that but I hope that I could say just a
 
07:35:47.230 --> 07:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
few words for myself and for the town of
 
07:35:49.910 --> 07:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
hopkington sure um
 
07:35:56.430 --> 07:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
um we have a $4 million pasas and toxics
 
07:35:58.350 --> 07:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
cleanup that we're going to have to do
 
07:36:01.230 --> 07:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
in hopkington it's at our transfer
 
07:36:06.110 --> 07:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
station $4 million is a big number for a
 
07:36:09.070 --> 07:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
town of our size for any town for that
 
07:36:12.750 --> 07:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
matter that cleanup does not include
 
07:36:14.708 --> 07:36:14.718 align:start position:0%
what we're going to have to do to treat
 
07:36:18.110 --> 07:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
the sludge in our wastewater treatment
 
07:36:21.030 --> 07:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
system so it's going to be 4 million
 
07:36:24.590 --> 07:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
plus plus plus um I just thought it
 
07:36:26.308 --> 07:36:26.318 align:start position:0%
would be good for you guys to know what
 
07:36:30.750 --> 07:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
we're facing in in other towns um in the
 
07:36:33.548 --> 07:36:33.558 align:start position:0%
process of putting together the plan for
 
07:36:35.708 --> 07:36:35.718 align:start position:0%
that I've spoken several times with
 
07:36:39.388 --> 07:36:39.398 align:start position:0%
Anthony drwan who is the residuals
 
07:36:41.990 --> 07:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
management supervisor at Dees and he's
 
07:36:44.030 --> 07:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
been incredibly helpful and I've learned
 
07:36:48.468 --> 07:36:48.478 align:start position:0%
a lot about PS and on a personal note I
 
07:36:51.590 --> 07:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that pasas was going into
 
07:36:53.948 --> 07:36:53.958 align:start position:0%
everybody's septic system the town
 
07:36:57.628 --> 07:36:57.638 align:start position:0%
Wastewater system I had no idea I had no
 
07:37:00.388 --> 07:37:00.398 align:start position:0%
idea that the sunscreen that I've been
 
07:37:03.070 --> 07:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
using for decades as a fair skinned
 
07:37:06.070 --> 07:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
person I use the waterproof
 
07:37:09.590 --> 07:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
version full of pasas I I I've been
 
07:37:11.468 --> 07:37:11.478 align:start position:0%
putting it all over my body and then I
 
07:37:14.948 --> 07:37:14.958 align:start position:0%
wash it off and it goes into the
 
07:37:18.230 --> 07:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
groundwater and I'm like oh my God you
 
07:37:20.708 --> 07:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
know who knew
 
07:37:24.150 --> 07:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
so another thing regarding Hopkinson is
 
07:37:26.948 --> 07:37:26.958 align:start position:0%
that we in in the Hopkinson Village I'm
 
07:37:31.230 --> 07:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
sorry the kukuk village Precinct we have
 
07:37:35.030 --> 07:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
our water comes from a pond in Warner so
 
07:37:36.830 --> 07:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
it goes through a treatment system
 
07:37:40.590 --> 07:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
before it goes out to the residents that
 
07:37:42.990 --> 07:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
treatment system is really Antiquated
 
07:37:45.150 --> 07:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
and so we're doing a study now to see
 
07:37:49.230 --> 07:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
whether we can upgrade it rebuild it or
 
07:37:51.708 --> 07:37:51.718 align:start position:0%
what may be a lot more coste effective
 
07:37:54.150 --> 07:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
for us is to turn to groundwater as our
 
07:37:56.708 --> 07:37:56.718 align:start position:0%
source instead of using the surface
 
07:38:01.948 --> 07:38:01.958 align:start position:0%
water and as we've just said the
 
07:38:03.830 --> 07:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
groundwater you know we just did a
 
07:38:05.708 --> 07:38:05.718 align:start position:0%
natural resource inventory for the
 
07:38:07.910 --> 07:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission we've seen the
 
07:38:10.628 --> 07:38:10.638 align:start position:0%
extent of our aquafers and our
 
07:38:12.750 --> 07:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater and that's all being
 
07:38:16.430 --> 07:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
contaminated potentially just by
 
07:38:19.230 --> 07:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
people's own backyard septic systems
 
07:38:21.468 --> 07:38:21.478 align:start position:0%
so it feels like we're cornered we're
 
07:38:23.750 --> 07:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
cornered as individuals we're cornered
 
07:38:25.910 --> 07:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
as a town we're
 
07:38:30.468 --> 07:38:30.478 align:start position:0%
cornered by the producers of pasas and I
 
07:38:33.708 --> 07:38:33.718 align:start position:0%
really hope that you guys will pass this
 
07:38:36.708 --> 07:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
ought to pass um so we can move forward
 
07:38:38.990 --> 07:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
on doing something about this disaster
 
07:38:41.308 --> 07:38:41.318 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
07:38:46.948 --> 07:38:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:49.230 --> 07:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
Hatfield T left
 
07:38:58.590 --> 07:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:00.750 --> 07:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
sheet shouldn't have grabbed it on my
 
07:39:00.760 --> 07:39:17.430 align:start position:0%
sheet shouldn't have grabbed it on my
way

07:39:17.430 --> 07:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:20.750 --> 07:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
by okay okay I'm going
 
07:39:25.430 --> 07:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
to uh skip over the people who spoke in
 
07:39:28.230 --> 07:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
po p for
 
07:39:31.990 --> 07:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
it well let's just say everybody on this
 
07:39:34.150 --> 07:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
page is for it except
 
07:39:37.990 --> 07:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
for Christen Co in
 
07:39:40.910 --> 07:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
Bia oh yeah of
 
07:39:45.868 --> 07:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
course and everything everybody else
 
07:39:50.590 --> 07:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
so that's enough put in the file okay uh
 
07:39:53.270 --> 07:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
with that uh I can assure everyone that
 
07:39:56.548 --> 07:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
um we will be doing a subcommittee in
 
07:39:59.510 --> 07:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
the first week of February uh this bill
 
07:40:01.190 --> 07:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
has is an early bill so we have to have
 
07:40:04.070 --> 07:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
it out before then and with that I will
 
07:40:17.510 --> 07:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:17.520 --> 07:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
