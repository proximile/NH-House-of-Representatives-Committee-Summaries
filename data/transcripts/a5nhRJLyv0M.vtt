00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:35.029 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
with almost the same language except for
 
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.029 align:start position:0%
with almost the same language except for
some

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
amendments that came from the extensive
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
public testimony that we had an
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
extensive um written and oral
 
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
Communications that we received from an
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
incredible number of citizens in this
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
state out of those responses we could
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
draw several
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
conclusions the first is that there
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
was strong
 
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
support for the amendment the second is
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
that there were those uh people in the
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
community who
 
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
opposed uh the bill for a number of
 
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
consideration it came clear to us that
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
on the merits of the
 
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill there were some changes that could
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
be made that would improve the
 
00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959 align:start position:0%
bill one is we eliminated from the bill
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
language including Physicians assistance
 
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
assist and the reason for that is in
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
this state Physicians assistants cannot
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh act on their own their actions have
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
to be supported by a physician and in
 
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
because of that and
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
respecting the rules and guidelines in
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
the medical community we eliminated
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistance and as as an
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate change the second change
 
00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
that we made again having to do with
 
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
existing state
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
law has to do with
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
pharmacists um we had in uh
 
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
conversations first very helpfully with
 
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.590 align:start position:0%
conversations first very helpfully with
two

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature who are
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
Pharmacists and uh and then with with
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
others who um wanted to make sure that
 
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
the role of Pharmacists was very clear
 
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
conformed with state law and
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
um and made it possible for them to
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
participate in a way that in this state
 
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
is appropriate I think those are
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
actually the two major changes that we
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
made because the amendment replaces
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
everything I am going to take a minute
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
or two if the chair agrees to talk about
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
why we have this bill in the first place
 
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
proceed yes please proceed sorry for um
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
almost 30
 
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
years in this country the practice of
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
medical assistance in end of life
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
decisions has been in
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.069 align:start position:0%
decisions has been in
effect

00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
as of now 10 states and the District of
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
Colombia have had this
 
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
experience we in New Hampshire have
 
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
looked at this year after year after
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
year there has always been public
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
support and there has always been and I
 
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.350 align:start position:0%
support and there has always been and I
say

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
appropriately a
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
hesitant to add this to the list of
 
00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
endof life options that we have in this
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
state of course we have um we have
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
paliative care and we have hospice care
 
00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:43.959 align:start position:0%
we have end of life
 
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
directives and um I would
 
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
parenthetically suggest that if you all
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
don't have an end of life directive you
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
ought to because the state encourages it
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's a very important component of Our
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
Own Health Care it tells our family what
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
we care about and what matters to us it
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
tells our medical uh caregivers it tells
 
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
the hospitals and all of this is part of
 
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
a long-term effort in this state to
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
recognize that the one thing every one
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
of us
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
experiences is
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
death not one of us in this room will
 
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
be able to escape death unless you know
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
something I don't know and please do
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
tell me so the state of New Hampshire
 
00:12:41.189 --> 00:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
has paid attention to this for many many
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
years what has happened however is that
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
we wanted to
 
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
see what was going on in other states
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
how did it work how many people
 
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
participate what were the pluses what
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
were the minuses and this went on very
 
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
carefully very very carefully um every
 
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
two years we had a bill every two years
 
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
this committee didn't support it and
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
therefore the house didn't support it
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
about three years ago something happened
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
that was very very important and that
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
was a group of New Hampshire citizens
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
came together to
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
decide take a break from just filing a
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
bill here and filing a bill there but to
 
00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
really do do the kind of research that
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
had to be done do comparative studies of
 
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
what happened in other states see the
 
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
results um and uh and
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
also talk to people across the state to
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
advocate for this as one more
 
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
alternative out of that effort a bill
 
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.550 align:start position:0%
alternative out of that effort a bill
was

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
drafted um
 
00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
we had a very a high level of interest
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
on the part of our colleagues who wanted
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
to join us in in sponsoring this bill we
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
submitted a bill that was similar to
 
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:19.240 align:start position:0%
what was suggested but had certain
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
changes to address it the very cautious
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
careful conservative look we wanted to
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
adopt in this
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
state if you have a horrible painful
 
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
long time degenerative
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
disease um but if there's no expectation
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
that you're going to die from that
 
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
within six months you are not eligible
 
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
to even be considered for this if you do
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
not have complete mental
 
00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
acuity to make an informed decision you
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
cannot participate at this um and uh and
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
that's important you need two
 
00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:08.189 align:start position:0%
that's important you need two
independent

00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
independent
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
doctors um who make certain
 
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.790 align:start position:0%
doctors um who make certain
decisions

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
uh one of the uh all of us received a
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
letter recently from a a doctor in
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
Oregon who has been involved in this for
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
20 or more years and explained the
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
process and the number of people and one
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
of the points that he makes that I find
 
00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:34.710 align:start position:0%
of the points that he makes that I find
most

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
telling and those of us who have and I
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
think most of us have
 
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
experienced with a loved one uh a
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
difficult end of life he said that many
 
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
of the people who have
 
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
requested uh to participate in this
 
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
program and have gotten the prescription
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
do not in fact use it but knowing that
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
if the situation becomes absolutely
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
unbearable they have an
 
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
option and that has provided comfort
 
00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
that has helped to make end of
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
life options that much better I think
 
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.829 align:start position:0%
life options that much better I think
that's

00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:22.839 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
important the other last point that I
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
want to make um well two the first I
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
cannot address the and I will not
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
address the issues of opposit to this
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
bill based on religious beliefs
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
believing in the separation of church
 
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
and state I have
 
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
not gotten involved on that but I
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
respect everyone's right to make that
 
00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:50.839 align:start position:0%
decision for themselves if their
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs do are not comfortable
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
with this so be it of course there is no
 
00:16:59.790 --> 00:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
compulsion but I don't think other
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
people have the right to determine the
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs of their fellow
 
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
citizens so I'm not going to go into any
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
detail on that but I am going to talk
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
about those with
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities some of you might know and
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
this is personal but I think it's
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
relevant that for 10 years or more my
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
husband worked for the disabilities
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
rights Center carrying
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
out our really shared commitment
 
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
to understanding that those with
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
disabilities in this state and in this
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
country are not necessarily treated
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
well and their rights needed to be
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
protected and it was with great interest
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
that I read the letter from the head of
 
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.390 align:start position:0%
that I read the letter from the head of
the

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
orgon disability Council I think is the
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
last word or maybe it's another word but
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's that group the person who has been
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
head of that Organization for uh more
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
experienced uh correspondence
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
involvement concerns expressed from the
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
disability community in
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
Oregon and the concern is the only the
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
only concern that was shared with the
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities Rights group in Oregon was
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
that people with disabilities in Oregon
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
felt that they were being denied the
 
00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:38.919 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take advantage of a
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
choice that people without
 
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities could participate in and in
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
more than two decades those are the only
 
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
complaints the only complaints that came
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
um to the disabilities Rights group in
 
00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.430 align:start position:0%
um to the disabilities Rights group in
Oregon

00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
Oregon
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
this is a perfect example of why it was
 
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
good that it's taken us till
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
2024 to decide to come forward seriously
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
with this bill because we can benefit
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
from the experience of what has happened
 
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
all across this country and make clear
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
that what we do in this country differs
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
dramatically from what happens in other
 
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
countries we do not believe in this
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
country in euthanasia euthanasia is not
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
legal um we do not follow certain
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
patterns or practices that exist in
 
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.990 align:start position:0%
patterns or practices that exist in
other

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
countries what we are looking at here is
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
how to make sure that the citizens of
 
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire relatively few but still
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire have an
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have one more choice in
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
how their life ends
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
and um and because of that Mr chairman
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
and I talk too long I know that um and
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for not interrupting me but I
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
believe that is why um the amendment to
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
1283 is carefully constructed is sound
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
is respectful of all um uh communities
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
in this state and provides a beneficial
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
alternative that provides comfort
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
not only to those people who are nearing
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
the end of life but to their families
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
who can be with them and
 
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
participate and not find themselves in a
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
situation where for example given no
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
other options someone who feels
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
desperate feels the need on his own or
 
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
her own to end their lives more
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
violently thank you Mr
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
chair thank you other uh people wish to
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
be heard on this
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
bill Representatives on the amendment
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Staples thank
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you uh question
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
did I understand that the the first
 
00:21:12.909 --> 00:21:12.919 align:start position:0%
element of change was to eliminate the
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%
physician as an assistant in this
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
process did I hear that correctly um the
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
yes we removed the language that would
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
have permitted a physician
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
assistant to have any role in
 
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
this but the phys a physician a
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
physician assistant right okay but a a a
 
00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
fully qualified physician yes is still
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
in the process yes absolutely you must
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
be a fully
 
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.110 align:start position:0%
be a fully
qualified

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh physician or someone in the medical
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
community who has the power to act on
 
00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:51.559 align:start position:0%
his or her own whereas a physician
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
assistant cannot act on his or her own
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
and that's why that was eliminated
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
because we have to be clear about
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
responsibility and it also by the way
 
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
shows us the importance of
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
Licensing uh for those people who um
 
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:11.799 align:start position:0%
have incredible responsibility in this
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
state followup yes yes absolutely the
 
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
second was the role of Pharmacists yes
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
and has that been expanded or reduced
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
and does it go into the detail as the
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
type of prescription for the the dose
 
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
okay the answer to that is it does not
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
go into detail nor should it I believe
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
for what the actual prescription is
 
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
since I don't think anyone of us is a
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacist Maybe I'm Wrong um and I
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
don't know your drug use I know mine is
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
pretty limited um we don't have the
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge nor should we of what the
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
actual prescription should be what the
 
00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
bill says is that those important
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
decisions are made by the medical
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
community but the amendment makes clear
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
what the physician what the
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
pharmacist's responsibility is and
 
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
accountability and
 
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
um and that we thought was was important
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
it that is what is specified in in the
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
amendment and so that is only for
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
producing and delivering during the
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
prescription is the pharmacist role and
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
not in direct attendance yes that is
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
correct thank you just to follow up we
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
specifically if you look on uh page one
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
of the amendment lines 23 to
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
25 it we included pharmacists but it
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
specifically says that a pharmacist does
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
not qualify either as a prescribing
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
health care provider or a Consulting
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
health care provider so pharmacist can't
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
they they their their role is to fill
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
the prescription and uh provide the
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
drugs but they can't they can't be the
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
ones that decide if somebody qualifies
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
prescription other other yes
 
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
chair and I I have a question hopefully
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
one of the sponsors of the amendment
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
could answer this for me is there
 
00:24:28.269 --> 00:24:28.279 align:start position:0%
anywhere in here that provides for
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
somebody just signed an affidavit saying
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
that they that somebody self-
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
administered the drug because I'm under
 
00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
the impression
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
that if there's no evidence to show that
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
the drug was self-administered how do we
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
know that they weren't
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
coerced into taking
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
it okay representative Smith do you want
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
Alexander I I just had probably an
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
irreverent thought and that is if the
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
tree falls in the forest and no one sees
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
it fall how do we know that it's Fallen
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
if nobody's documented it um in fact the
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
experience across um uh the country in
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
in 10 states in the district of Colombia
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
is that um with
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
hospice and don't forget each of these
 
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
patients must have been in
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
hospice um or having had
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
expectation and with the others who are
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
charged with providing Medical Care to
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
that patient they have to
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
document um what happens at the end of
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
life the death
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
certificates um uh do in fact show the
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
disease um or the
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
cause of death again I don't know the
 
00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:53.149 align:start position:0%
cause of death again I don't know the
medical

00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:25:53.159 --> 00:25:54.909 align:start position:0%
medical
terminology

00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
terminology
 
00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%
um and so that
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
documentation if I could follow of
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
course you know uh the chair might have
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
a more
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
legal legally based definition than I
 
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
ever could come up with I I I mean I
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
guess yeah I guess if you're asking does
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
there does is there something specific
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill that says there has to be an
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
a no the answer to that is no I'm not I
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
guess I just don't see that um is a
 
00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
particular is a particular issue of uh
 
00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
the the whether the cause of the cause
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
of death I mean I think it does the bill
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
does specifically say that the cause of
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
death is the underlying condition not
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
the not whether the person took them not
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
whether the person died as a result of
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
the medication or not so that I so I I
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
guess I'm wondering like I'm trying to
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
come up with some sort of hypothetical
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
here so say um my grandmother was in in
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
hospice um and my mom was with her and
 
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
she chose to take this drug of her own
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
accord and or at least obtain it right
 
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
like so they have it and then she
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
decides eventually not to go through it
 
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
but another loved one is like you know
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
what you should go through with it and
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
then it becomes a coercion kind of thing
 
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
after the drug is obtained right like
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's my like there's no sort of
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
affidavit to say that somebody signs a
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
under penalty of perjury that the person
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
self-administered it on their own will
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's my concern is like once the drugs
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
completely obtained where's the evidence
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
to show that the person who administered
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
the drug did it of their own free will
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
and they were not
 
00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:44.919 align:start position:0%
coerced well I I mean I I I guess my
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
response to that would be the the fact
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
that the person has made the decision to
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
do it initially has that has been
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
confirmed by two doctors and you know if
 
00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
you're I mean I guess guess if the if if
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
your hype if your if your theory is is
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
there could that potentially the
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
scenario that you talked about happen
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I suppose it possibly could it
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
seems to me it's pretty it's pretty
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
unlikely that that would happen I guess
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
we don't you know I'm not I'm not sort
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
of prepared to think that most of the
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
that we we need to be thinking that
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
family members are likely to be
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
generally coercing their their loved
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
ones to to do this I'm does it ever
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
happen yes it does happen and not only
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
in this area but in other areas people
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
get coerced in their old age to uh to
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
transfer property or do things like that
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
we hopefully we have a court system that
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
is able to address those but I I don't
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
see that as a particular issue at least
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
personally I don't see that as a
 
00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:48.519 align:start position:0%
particular issue here yeah and I I just
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
my last point I submit to you that's
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
probably in my opinion more common than
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
you think it is that's all okay uh
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative tur yes sorry just what
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
just one statement on that I think in
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
general the construct around that kind
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
of thinking would be that we are
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
implying misbehavior as sort of the
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
default um as opposed to basically
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
saying if there's evidence of coercion
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
then that would obviously come to light
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
but absent that why would we imply
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
misbehavior or taking the affidavit
 
00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:23.519 align:start position:0%
proposition a little bit further
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't that be coerced as well so I I
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
I I don't think there's a way sort of to
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
to handle this with the assumption that
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
essentially coercion would happen unless
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
there's some evidence that it hasn't you
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
know the if I could just follow up the
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
other point I would make on that and I
 
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
think that I think uh representative ter
 
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
ra raises a a very valid point is to a
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
to avoid a claim simply I me know if we
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
if the affidavit could be executed by
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
the the sort of next of kin who might
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
have some interest in The Inheritance or
 
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
whatever you'd have the same argument
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
well they they were Co first to execute
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
the affidavit and what it would seem to
 
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
me what that would mean is that you
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
would have to say some neutral
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
party has to be there at the at the
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
actual time of death or immediately
 
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
before the time of death and to me that
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
really Cuts Cuts against the whole idea
 
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
of this of of being let's make sure
 
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
someone makes a a voluntary decision
 
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:26.919 align:start position:0%
confirmed by two qualified Physicians to
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
and then is able to get the prescription
 
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
they have to then wait 48 hours before
 
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
it can the prescription can be delivered
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh but then it's up to the person to
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
decide when to take it and I would
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
presume that most people would say I
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
want to do I don't want some stranger
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
here when I'm about to about to take
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
this medication I want my family here um
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
and so that you know that would be a
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
reason it would seem to me to not want
 
00:30:54.679 --> 00:30:55.750 align:start position:0%
reason it would seem to me to not want
to

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
have some kind of an affidavit system
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
right at the time of death now
 
00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:03.190 align:start position:0%
right at the time of death now
representative

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:06.039 align:start position:0%
Perez yes um I'm speaking to the
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
amendment um the amendment does not
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
change the bill entirely it changes two
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
small segments of the bill um it doesn't
 
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
change um the intent of the bill it
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't protect people and as far as
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
support for and against at the time of
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
the hearing in there were um
 
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
1,125 um online against the bill as
 
00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:36.519 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
658 for the bill now since we brought up
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
Oregon as a mentor of this um Oregon has
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
reported that 14.8% of people who have
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
taken the drug have had a adverse
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
reaction a huge adverse
 
00:31:57.629 --> 00:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
reactions um hanging on to men meds
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
concoctions and these are a concoction
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
hanging on to meds is not a good idea
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
because they expire and my concern about
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
the disabilities that have been brought
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
up um in the UNH which it was brought up
 
00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:18.519 align:start position:0%
disabilities in the UNH um survey the
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
two questions the second was do you
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
considered yourself disabled is that
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
what we're going to put on this next and
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
as far as who supports disabled the
 
00:32:32.629 --> 00:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
National Council National not State
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
National Council on disabilities is
 
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill opposed to
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
assistant suicide and the Veterans
 
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
Affairs State Veterans Affairs is
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill they do not want
 
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities added on
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
Veterans added on like has happened in
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
other states and in other countries so
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's addressing the bill this bill
 
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment does not change the bill
 
00:33:07.149 --> 00:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get rid of the
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
flaws and when we get to the bill I have
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
spoken to a lawyer who specializes in
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
medical male practice
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
trip thank you Mr chair uh with regard
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
to representative Alexander's uh
 
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.950 align:start position:0%
to representative Alexander's uh
question

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
about documenting that the uh the person
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
self- administered if you go to uh page
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
eight of the amendment uh lines one
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
through like 21 talk to uh the paperwork
 
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
that is uh
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
required uh of the uh
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
Administration and uh everything else
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
with the qualified individual uh I I
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
think the important section here is that
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh on lines three and four it speaks to
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
Services adopting rules pursuant to uh
 
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.510 align:start position:0%
Services adopting rules pursuant to uh
RSA

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
541 on reporting data relating to this
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh I think as in many bills the uh the
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
bill is the framework of the law and the
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
rules that the uh departments generate
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
later on are are the are the Flesh of
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
the bill that expands what is done and I
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
think if you were concerned about this
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
we could uh you know talk with the
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
and make sure that something like that
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
is included in their
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
rules thank you other other comments
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
questions all right I've seeing none I
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
guess I the the the last thing that I
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
would say is I'm uh I am obviously I'm a
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill I am a strong
 
00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
supporter of it I agree with uh
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's uh recitation
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
earlier and I guess the only other thing
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
I would say is I I understand that there
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
are strong differences of opinion on
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
this you know 30 years ago if if I had
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
been faced with this issue U I'm not
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
sure I would have had the same view I
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
have now you're you know you're young
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
and you sort of you know you're
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
Invincible uh at 74 years old I
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
fortunately knock on wood I I'm still in
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
relatively good health but uh you know I
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
I realize that I'm in the Autumn of my
 
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.390 align:start position:0%
I realize that I'm in the Autumn of my
life

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
and I want the the Liberty if if the
 
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances arise when I'm when you
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
know the choice is
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
endure uh terrible suffering or or be
 
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
able to end it in a in a more peaceful
 
00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
way I want that option uh and I think if
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
you know if if if I should have that
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
option it seems to me that everybody
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
should have that option um I I
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
understand the the concerns that are
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
raised about you know this is the
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
slippery slope I've I understand the
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
slippery slope argument I've made the
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
slippery slope argument myself in some
 
00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:17.790 align:start position:0%
slippery slope argument myself in some
contexts

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
contexts
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
but here it seems to me we the
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
legislature will be in control of
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
whether there are changes um to to uh
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
what is allowed now and I'm I mean to
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
me the key provision of this bill is
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
that you be within six months of death I
 
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.829 align:start position:0%
that you be within six months of death I
can't

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
imagine ever supporting something that
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know was was more than that that if
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
you that if you're not within six months
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
of death but you're severely depressed
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
or uh you're disabled or something like
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
that that that somehow is an excuse to
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
allow to allow uh you to end your life I
 
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
would say absolutely not and I and I
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
think that most people in New Hampshire
 
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
and around the country would say that
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
also um and so you know what that means
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
is the legislature has to draw lines but
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's what we do we draw lines every
 
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
Bill we're going to exect today I bet
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
you is there's some line drawing we said
 
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
you can do this but you can't do that
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's what that's why we were elected
 
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:28.599 align:start position:0%
so I think we can competently draw those
 
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
lines and I think where they're drawn
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
here are the appropriate lines any
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
further comment yes representative Lanza
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
Perez so I'm a nurse and I'm GNA say
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
honestly that um I really also support
 
00:37:50.349 --> 00:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
um this um because I have witnessed many
 
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
people who have um died over the years
 
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you um as an off op
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
option is very um important I think that
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
having witness people who have died
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
through hospice um it's very hard to you
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
have medications in your home even with
 
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
hospice okay and um and you are um self
 
00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
administering the I mean you are
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
administering helping them but with this
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
this is an option for a person who is
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
terminally ill has that six months or
 
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
less to um live
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
and that is giving them that option
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
again it's an option and I want to keep
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
on saying that option nobody was let you
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
say is forcing that person to take this
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
medication it is their option if they
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
was let you say um because many people
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
have witnessed um deaths before and this
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
is not easy it's not an easy part of
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
life um was let you say we all know that
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
we are we come into the world and then
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
we have to die and it's not a um was I
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
say um easy to witness death especially
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
with loved ones but at the same time uh
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
to give them the option to be present um
 
00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
for families if they want what whatever
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
they want is their decision to make but
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
again I think it's definitely what you
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
have to think about is an option for our
 
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
um people in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
and um and that's why I need to speak up
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
about this thank you thank you
 
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.470 align:start position:0%
about this thank you thank you
representor

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
representor
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
perz first um there is no
 
00:39:43.309 --> 00:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
standard of life expectancy for a
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
terminal ill patient no
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
standard secondly I have never fought
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill I have only
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
fought the flaws of the bill hospice
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
requires you to have your attending
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
physician and a hospice doctor be the
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
ones to certify you to become
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
hospice can't we at least have that kind
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
of standard that at least your attending
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
Doctor Who has been treating you is part
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
decision this is two arbitrary
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
Physicians or nurse practitioners based
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
basically there's nowhere in here that
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
says the Doctor Who said you're going to
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
die in 6 months is involved it says your
 
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
medical records but there's no
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
requirement in here that your medical
 
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
records requirement that your medical
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
records are reviewed if hospice has done
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
a wonderful job but yet we have a page
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
and a half in here protecting the
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
doctors yes I did speak to a lawyer in
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
another state who deals with
 
00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.349 align:start position:0%
another state who deals with
malpractice

00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
malpractice
 
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
exclusively I sent him the bill this
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
bill opens us up and you have so many
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
lawyers here I'm it amazes me this bill
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
opens up everybody for all kinds you
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
know you could have two doctors and set
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
up an
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
office and this is what they did for a
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
living they chose
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
to do this come on down fix the bill
 
00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
there's no residence requirement here
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
fix the bill and if you want to talk
 
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
about people who wrote letters we all
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
just got a letter and this is something
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
that came up during the hearing that I
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
had never thought about the two young
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
people who came were afraid for their
 
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
peers that this would give them
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's okay to kill yourself we just got a
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
letter from a college student at the
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire a resident
 
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
of Rob Rochester opposing this bill by
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
normalizing the act of Endy one's life
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
with medical assistance especially in
 
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
the state where suicide rates among
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
youth are already too high you are
 
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
effectively stating that an acceptable
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
solution to Life's challenges is killing
 
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.510 align:start position:0%
solution to Life's challenges is killing
yourself

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation would
 
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
undermine all the good work the state
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
has done on suicide prevention that's
 
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
from a
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
youngster we're considering and if you
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
want to talk about
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
discrimination this bill discriminates
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
against people under the age of 18 with
 
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.910 align:start position:0%
against people under the age of 18 with
terminal

terminal
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
illnesses what right do we have to do
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
that this bill is flawed raise the bar
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
raise the bar at least use the standards
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
that hospice
 
00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:04.559 align:start position:0%
uses at least use those standards for
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
people don't let people send up a stop

um represent Smith if you don't have a I
 
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
have a copy if you want that's the one
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
suicide all right representative
 
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
Alexander would you do you wish to speak
 
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
to your motion yeah just briefly if if
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
the states sanctioning suicide I think
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
we should remove the council it seems
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
like it's not needed if that's some if
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's the direction we want to go so
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you all right any other any other
 
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
comments I believe it's ludicrous to
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
have say on one hand one thing and on
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
the other the other thing and I know the
 
00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
Coalition um for the prevention of
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
suicide which I have great respect
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
for um is against this um Amendment but
 
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
at the same
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
token what about we're allowing children
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
have told us Young young adults have
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
told us why bother why bother you're
 
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
making it okay to commit suicide and you
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
can call it whatever you want to call it
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
but it is assisted
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
suicide any other
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
comments so my only comment is I I I
 
00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
just I have to say honestly I think this
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
amendment is beyond the pale it it it it
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
is sort of a poison pill that what what
 
00:46:28.349 --> 00:46:28.359 align:start position:0%
is the theory that that even if you view
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
this as um as as the main bill here as
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
being some kind of assisted suicide
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
which I do not but even if you view that
 
00:46:40.549 --> 00:46:40.559 align:start position:0%
as the case is is the answer to that to
 
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
say we the people who say we are opposed
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
to Suicide the answer by this amendment
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
is to say well then we'll we'll just
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
we'll allow even more suicide how does
 
00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
that how does that make any sense it
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
just seems to me it it
 
00:46:59.710 --> 00:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
I I I have difficulty understanding how
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
that could possibly make sense
 
00:47:02.079 --> 00:47:03.390 align:start position:0%
that could possibly make sense
representative

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
Perez in every state and in every
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
country that has adopted this the rates
 
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
of suicide have
 
00:47:16.549 --> 00:47:16.559 align:start position:0%
increased and and have the states that
 
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
have other states that have adopted this
 
00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:21.559 align:start position:0%
also adopted uh provision eliminating
 
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
their suicide Council so that we could
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
sort of encourage more suicide no no
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's but you say you don't consider this
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide what do you consider it
 
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
consider it exactly I consider it
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid in dying that's what I
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
consider representative
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
chair I took this amendment to be a
 
00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:47.309 align:start position:0%
chair I took this amendment to be a
warning

00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
warning
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
flag not necessarily um a literal
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
Improvement or disapprovement to the
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
bill but a warning flag
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
because this is medical assisted suicide
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to allow suicide and
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
and creeping human nature to expand uh
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
things to other people who are on the
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
fridge Fringe or the edge the limits
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
start to move if it's 6 months maybe it
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
seven um maybe the uh terminal illness
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh expands into other areas of uh
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
infirmity or weakness or depression or
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
Dementia or Alzheimer's or any number of
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
things and this has already happened in
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
in other countries uh especially in
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
Canada uh that is now just uh put on
 
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
hold an expansion for assisted suicide
 
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
from mental illness they putting that
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
off for 3 years you can you can
 
00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
structure um guide rail and safeguards
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
but you can't contain the variability of
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
human nature um unguided by maybe some
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
principles of Ethics or morality to uh
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
want an advantage to expand it to their
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
particular case and then we feel sorry
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
for the PO people who don't know who
 
00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
they are the Dementia or um Down
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
syndrome or any number of maladies and
 
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
infirmities I just see this as a
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
creeping toward it and this is the
 
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
warning flag um we're we're opening a
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
dangerous door here and I have many
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
constituents and myself too that under
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
moral uh beliefs and Faith beliefs that
 
00:49:50.589 --> 00:49:50.599 align:start position:0%
this is tampering with God's Providence
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
in the protection of life and the
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
sanctity of life in the gift that's
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
given us us and ignoring the hope that
 
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
we had development that we have in
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
hospice and pallative care and kind of
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
setting that aside and say okay let's
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
put this one out
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
there and I see that there are there are
 
00:50:14.109 --> 00:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
a number of problems with this whole
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
thing but two of which I I focused on
 
00:50:17.839 --> 00:50:18.829 align:start position:0%
thing but two of which I I focused on
you

00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
have in one case a couple of years ago
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
we eliminated the death penalty in the
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons we eliminated is
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
this cruel and unusual punishment and
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's death
 
00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
by uh
 
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
injection uh and replaced other more
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
horrendous means and there's been a
 
00:50:43.789 --> 00:50:43.799 align:start position:0%
number of failures botches and bungling
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
with this even in with Physicians and
 
00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
attendance and we're going to leave this
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
procedure up to the individual with or
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
without a
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
physician um and what about the
 
00:50:59.789 --> 00:50:59.799 align:start position:0%
cocktail um this is just one place
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's not acceptable in society and now
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to make it acceptable in
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
special circumstances which again can be
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
expanded and probably will be expanded
 
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:13.799 align:start position:0%
as we've seen in other countries um I
 
00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:16.839 align:start position:0%
can't go there we shouldn't go there we
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
should hold back from from this and
 
00:51:21.069 --> 00:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
focus on the more productive and
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
life-saving and healing aspects of uh
 
00:51:27.549 --> 00:51:27.559 align:start position:0%
good to high and pallative care I can't
 
00:51:27.559 --> 00:51:28.390 align:start position:0%
good to high and pallative care I can't
do

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
this comments on the
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
amend yes and it was a warning that is
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
especially is specifically why I put the
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill in it is a warning that this is
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
going to happen here just like it has
 
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere else so
 
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
therefore my warning I hope is heard and
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
sorry you
 
00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
right I'll I'll follow the sponsor of
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
the Amendments lead on this so Amendment
 
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment is
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
withdrawn now lost right um think so I
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
think there there any other
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
amend so I think we're on to the main uh
 
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:25.829 align:start position:0%
amend so I think we're on to the main uh
bill

00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
um do I have um a motion of ought to
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
pass with amend represent Smith um I so
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
move Mr
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
chair all right any further discussion
 
00:52:44.589 --> 00:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
on the main Bill yes representative
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
andw thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
everybody for coming
 
00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
today this is a contentious bill either
 
00:52:55.789 --> 00:52:55.799 align:start position:0%
way no matter how we vote
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
I am one of the older ones sitting
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
here and everybody thinks oh you you
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
look healthy blah blah
 
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
blah I have health
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
issues I have helped take care of my
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
father-in-law who died of
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
cancer there's nothing you can tell me
 
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
about death I have lived enough years
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
I've seen enough of it but I'm going to
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
tell you right here and right now I will
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
vote no on this bill because I do not
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
believe in assisted
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
suicide I think it's terrible I don't
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
think the government should be playing
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
this game I think there's a lot of holes
 
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh the survey that was done by UNH
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
the second question that are you
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
disabled that really flawed me and made
 
00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
me really open my eyes where are we
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
heading what are we
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
doing so I just wanted to make sure
 
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
everybody knew I'm going to vote no on
 
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
this bill and I will never change my
 
00:54:02.349 --> 00:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
you any other yes representative whoop
 
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
representative gon I'm sorry thank you
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I
 
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
have not made very many comments on this
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
bill listening to what everybody else
 
00:54:15.789 --> 00:54:15.799 align:start position:0%
has to
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
say and I have heard just about
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
everything that I would have said
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
especially from representative Stapleton
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
just a few moments ago who I think
 
00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
knocked it out of the
 
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
park but one thing that has not been
 
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
brought up that I will say now is I
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
don't think we
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
ability first of all I think this bill
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
is going to to leave this committee with
 
00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
an otpa
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation but I think it's a pic
 
00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
Victory because I think what's going to
 
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
end up happening is it is going to
 
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
change it will continually change until
 
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
eventually maybe not in your lifetime
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps not in mine but I do believe it
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
will be in
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
mine it won't be too long before options
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
start being eliminated and the only
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
option for treatment will be the 1283
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
pill because Healthcare cost keeps
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing and we're not doing
 
00:55:22.589 --> 00:55:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
problem we cut cost by prescrib ding
 
00:55:29.789 --> 00:55:29.799 align:start position:0%
pills medical procedures cost more money
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
pill cost a lot less money we can make
 
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
more of them
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
cheaper and eventually it's going to be
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
no pallative care is too expensive at
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
this point it's not really worth the
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
effort the only thing we will approve
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
this is the insurance companies the only
 
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
treatment we will we will approve is a
 
00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:51.069 align:start position:0%
treatment we will we will approve is a
1283

00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:51.079 align:start position:0%
1283
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
pill there won't be any
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
options and I don't think as a society
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
that we have the ability to restrain
 
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
ourselves the character to do it to
 
00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
restrain ourselves because we can look
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
out around the globe and we can see
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
everywhere this is being done it
 
00:56:11.549 --> 00:56:11.559 align:start position:0%
continually changes to expand the field
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
of who is qualified to where now even in
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
some countries parents are making their
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
decisions for their own children if a
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
child has a health condition then the
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
parent decides what to do about the
 
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
child and eventually it's not going to
 
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
be a terminal illness it's going to be
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
just because the child is difficult to
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
deal with and we're going to end up
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
having postbirth abortions for lack of a
 
00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.390 align:start position:0%
having postbirth abortions for lack of a
better

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
term and it's it y'all could call it a
 
00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:47.039 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theory or Nut Job whatever
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
but if you watch what's actually taking
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
place we have so devalued life in this
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
country and around the world
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's where we're
 
00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.470 align:start position:0%
that's where we're
headed

00:56:59.470 --> 00:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
headed
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
and I I agree with representative L uh
 
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
Andress that there is not an amendment
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
you can make to this bill that can
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
convince me to pass
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
it thank you any other comments
 
00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:15.829 align:start position:0%
it thank you any other comments
representative

00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr
 
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
chair um not to repeat um representative
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
gon's points very well
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
but there was another thing that
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
concerns me we we set the parameters and
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
the safeguards and the guard rails but
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
once you put out the six
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
months that's a red line it glows in the
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
dark um relative to people seeing that
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
and seeing Oh there's a window of
 
00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.349 align:start position:0%
and seeing Oh there's a window of
opportunity

00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
here and that's what suicide ideation
 
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
and tendency for ways out uh for
 
00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
depressed and lonely people will see
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
that and pick up on it but who else can
 
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
pick up on it insurance companies
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are out there to
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
make money and if you have a case where
 
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
even before a six months terminal di Pro
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
prognosis you have a person that wants
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
to go for every protection and every
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
chance for life he can and the insurance
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
company is going to control the
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
procedure and instead of authorizing a
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
$50,000 cancer regimen or or
 
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
fix oh we've got this um death assisted
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
suicide thing we we're not going to go
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
the 50 Grand but we'll authorize the
 
00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.390 align:start position:0%
the 50 Grand but we'll authorize the
assisted

00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
assisted
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
suicide um you can't control human
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
nature and that's the uncertain variable
 
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
in all of this um
 
00:58:58.109 --> 00:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
along with many other things that are
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
problematic here um I think it's time
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
that we got back to some basic life
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
value principles that comes out of
 
00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
ethics and
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
morality and let's start striving for
 
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
better pallative and hospice care and
 
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
involvement with families and whatever
 
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
else we have to do instead of taking
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
what I consider a cheap way out this is
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
not a slippery slope this is a step off
 
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.190 align:start position:0%
not a slippery slope this is a step off
a

00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
precipice and I can't support it in any
 
00:59:35.069 --> 00:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
way Amendment or
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
no right other comments yes
 
00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.990 align:start position:0%
no right other comments yes
representative

00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair I I have
 
00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.270 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair I I have
listened

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
listened
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
respectfully as I hope I always do to
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
the comments of my
 
00:59:58.349 --> 00:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
colleagues and what what makes me
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
sad is not that they do not agree with
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
this as an
 
01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
alternative the whole principle of the
 
01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
legislative process the whole principle
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
democracy is that we have disperate
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
views we come to issues with different
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
perspectives with different values and
 
01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
therefore it's when we come together and
 
01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
talk about those in a positive way that
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
we can understand how other people
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
feel and we can help shape our
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
own our own beliefs and I think that is
 
01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
very important it is why for
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
example that um I have always listened
 
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
with respect to to my colleague who
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
preceded me even though we disagree on
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
so many issues but I respect so the
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
philosophy that he brings and I want to
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
it my problem however is that I try
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
always to
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
do as we learned years ago on Dragnet to
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
listen to just the facts ma'am just the
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
facts and much of what has been said has
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
been influenced not by facts not by
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
demonstrated results not by proven
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
experience in other states but by
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
beginning with A prejudgment and then
 
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
trying to go on from there I for
 
01:01:59.069 --> 01:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
example don't uh I'm aware of what has
 
01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
happened in the Netherlands I'm aware of
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
what has happened in Canada
 
01:02:10.029 --> 01:02:10.039 align:start position:0%
um I am very pleased that I live in this
 
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
country I can actually come up now with
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
three or four or one example of uh of a
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
a law that passed in Canada that we then
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
copied here wholesale because it was in
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
Canada or the same thing for the
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
Netherlands we have different ways of
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
reaching our judgments here and I value
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
those different ways of reaching
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
judgments I don't want to be ever find
 
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
myself in a situation where I am
 
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
quibbling about words where I am
 
01:02:50.029 --> 01:02:50.039 align:start position:0%
quibbling about what does suicide mean
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
as against Medical Aid and dying um
 
01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
although I see tremendous
 
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
differences I know that when people die
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
as a result of suicide very
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
frequently it's a violent
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
death very frequently it is an of the
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
moment decision and because the means
 
01:03:17.309 --> 01:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
happens to be
 
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
available somebody acts on it whereas if
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
the means hadn't been there they might
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
not have acted in that way and waited
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
for a moon to change I know that most
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
suicides take place when the person is
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
alone some of that is because
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
they're of their mood some of it is to
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
protect their family so that their
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
end I think that's
 
01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
awful I look at the statistics that come
 
01:03:58.029 --> 01:03:58.039 align:start position:0%
um uh uh from uh about the end of life
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
that many
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
veterans shocking number of veterans
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
experience and because they've been
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
trained to use weapons they've been
 
01:04:11.549 --> 01:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
trained uh to solve problems with
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
weapons they choose a violent death and
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
what does that
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
do to their families who they leave
 
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
behind what does that do to the
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
community what does that do to our sense
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
of obligation to those people who who
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
really we sent into a situation where
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
the first thing we expected them to do
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
is to give up their own
 
01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.549 align:start position:0%
is to give up their own
values

01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
um this is not what this bill is about
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
and we live in a toxic environment I
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
doubt if there's anyone in this room who
 
01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
if not depressed at
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
least low in spirit about what is going
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
on around us about people dying about
 
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
violence about um disrespect for
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
individuals lack of concern for our
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
neighbor all of that these are tough
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.079 --> 01:05:24.589 align:start position:0%
 
through

01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
I believe that what this is is an
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
attempt to
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
address in a careful
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
narrow structured
 
01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
responsible legal
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
way an opportunity to provide an option
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
for those
 
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
people who choose to take advantage of
 
01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
this option and who are able to make an
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
En formed
 
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
decision about the end of their own life
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
and I hope that we can continue to
 
01:06:08.349 --> 01:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
improve um hospice when we first began
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
these discussions in this legisl where I
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
participated in
 
01:06:15.269 --> 01:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
1997 before perhaps some of you were
 
01:06:15.279 --> 01:06:17.230 align:start position:0%
1997 before perhaps some of you were
born

01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
born
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
hospice was
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
paralyzed to
 
01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:26.839 align:start position:0%
do what they now do appropriately which
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
is to address issues of pain and we've
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
come to understand different ideas of
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
pain over the time is hospice getting
 
01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:38.839 align:start position:0%
all the support that it needs is
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
pallative care getting of course not is
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
any area of Medical Care getting all the
 
01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
support that it needs absolutely not but
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
here is one example where it is
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate to pres I believe for those
 
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
few people who would be eligible and who
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
would choose to take
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
advantage to have this option and to
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
know at the same time that in a
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
democratic small D Democratic Society I
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
know represent of greason is going to
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
say we're a republic not a democracy but
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
that's okay for the point of this
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
argument I think I could say this that
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature will continue to be in
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
charge and will continue to say this
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
works or this doesn't work I can give
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
you a very clear example of that that
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
takes place in orgon a state we've
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
already mentioned and that is orgon
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
moved a few years ago to completely
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
decriminalize um drug
 
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
use and they have now come to
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
decide that that was not the best way to
 
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
handle the horrible problem problem that
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
we have in this country about drug use
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
and they're changing it's the
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
legislature that is looking and watching
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
and changing and keeping control um and
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
I believe that this
 
01:08:11.309 --> 01:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
bill gives the legislature an
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to act responsibly knowing
 
01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
full well and one would hope with some
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
faith in the integrity and intelligence
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
of future legislators to know that there
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
will continue to be close eyes kept on
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
this and every other issue that is
 
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
happening at this moment in every other
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
room here in the legislative office
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
building and um I hope therefore that an
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of this committee
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
will join the rest of us in supporting
 
01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and bringing it to the house
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
and then to to have the house be able to
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
decide whether to send this bill on to
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
the Senate where we start the entire
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
thing all over again thank you Mr
 
01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
chair yes representative Greece oh thank
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair just real quick there's one
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
disturbing point that I did forget to
 
01:09:14.669 --> 01:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
point out
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
earlier you are guilty of a class B
 
01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
felony we're trying to stop somebody
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
from doing this we talked about coercion
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
in in trying to C somebody into taking
 
01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:26.829 align:start position:0%
in in trying to C somebody into taking
the

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
medication but what we have here is a
 
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:30.759 align:start position:0%
class B felony
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
penalty for trying to stop somebody from
 
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
doing it now it uses the terms coercing
 
01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
or exerting due undue influence but we
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't Define what is coercion or or
 
01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.229 align:start position:0%
don't Define what is coercion or or
undue

01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
undue
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
influence and it's going to become so
 
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
subjective that just simply no please
 
01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
stop is going to be considered undo
 
01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
influence so without those definitions
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
you're now guilty of a of a class B
 
01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
felony so we're going to
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
we we we have
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
so devalued life and we want to make
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
sure that somebody can can take their
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
own life that we're going to actually
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
make a felon out of somebody who simply
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
tries to stop them from doing it and I
 
01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
know you could think they're going to
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
duct tape their wrists to the chairs or
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
whatever that's not what's going to
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
happen it's going to be a please don't
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
do this and now you're going to be a
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
felon but since there are no witnesses
 
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
to all of this how are you going to
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
prove anything but with that I say we
 
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
move the question we've already been on
 
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
this for an hour and 10 minutes
 
01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
representative Perez you have if you
 
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
have something new to say please okay go
 
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
ahead first of all I don't lie I have
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
been called honest to a fault and it has
 
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
gotten me in trouble multiple multiple
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
times and I had no
 
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
preconceived idea on this because having
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
seen people die and have working in
 
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
intensive care for many years I I see
 
01:10:58.510 --> 01:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
both sides of the story but the bill is
 
01:11:01.149 --> 01:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
what I have fought there's no residency
 
01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
it has the word Pleasant in it it is not
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
a pleasant death for everyone that's
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
misleading why not just have the
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
standards that proven
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
hospice has had hospice has standards
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
for how you enter it but yet we're
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
eliminating those proven standards
 
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
and letting basically any physician give
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
you permission not even your prescribing
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
physician and California did change they
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
went from 15-day weight to a 48 hour and
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
the it went up by
 
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.790 align:start position:0%
the it went up by
65%

01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
65%
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
65% all I'm asking you to
 
01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
do for the people you mentioned Oregon
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
how they had a law
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
that per you know for drugs and now
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to change it what about
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
all the people that suffered because
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
there was no criminalization of drugs
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
are we going to pass a bill with flaws
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
and then say whoops we got to change it
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
because this happened and this happened
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
and this happened why not just get a
 
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
good bill first I a and as far as
 
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
um those of us that are
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
Republicans we have have
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
principles we have our um platform of
 
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
principles and one of the principles in
 
01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
this platform specifically say states
 
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
that we oppose euin Asia and physician
 
01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:44.070 align:start position:0%
that we oppose euin Asia and physician
assistant

01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
suicide I will not go against what I
 
01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
pledge to
 
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
follow especially when we have a faulty
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
Bill any other yes representative Kenny
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman just a real
 
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
brief comment um because I heard a
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
comment that really bothered me um a few
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
comments ago I completely reject the
 
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
idea that this bill would allow a quote
 
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
cheap way out end quote or any negative
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
connotation that I've heard we in this
 
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
room will never experience what a person
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
in that state is experiencing until we
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
are there and we don't know what options
 
01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
we will value um until you're there
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
there um you know in New Hampshire we
 
01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
value Freedom so some of these comments
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
have really really surprised me um I
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
agree with the sentiment from
 
01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
representative Smith that some of these
 
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
comments are not based in facts so I
 
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
won't repeat those but this is a wellth
 
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
thought out bill that has been worked on
 
01:13:42.189 --> 01:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
for a long time and studied it's a bill
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
of compassion not cruelty and it's a
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
dignified quote way out end quote and I
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
fully support it thank you
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative Andrew
 
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
chair okay we want to base something on
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
facts I want to give you a fact and then
 
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
I want to give you a true
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
experience no doctor I don't care who
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
they are I don't care if you have 20 of
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
them they have no right to tell a person
 
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
you got six months to
 
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
live my father many years ago had an
 
01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
accident he ended up in the hospital
 
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
I'll make this
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
fast he was mentally incompetent after
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
about 30 days the doctor said to me and
 
01:14:29.629 --> 01:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
the rest of my family he will never be
 
01:14:29.639 --> 01:14:31.790 align:start position:0%
the rest of my family he will never be
any

01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
different we knew my father didn't want
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
to live that way so we had all the tubes
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
and everything pulled from
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
him my
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
father kept
 
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
living my father's mental ability came
 
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
back he went and had Rehabilitation and
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
he went home he was in his 80s and lived
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
several more years so the fact is the
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
doctors have no real right to tell
 
01:15:02.189 --> 01:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
somebody how long they're going to live
 
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
because they don't know no more than we
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
do thank you any other comments or yes I
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
have one um just real quickly I feel
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
compelled to tell this story a lot of
 
01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
you do not know but about a year ago I
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
was really sick and um I actually
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
currently awaiting heart transplant
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
and I was if I hadn't got accepted to
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
the elad program which I have on me
 
01:15:31.629 --> 01:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
right now that's why I carry a bag with
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
me everywhere I go um then I would be in
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
hospice right now and I would definitely
 
01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
have had a year or less to live and so I
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
would have liked this option coming upon
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
the sixth month if I would have been um
 
01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I would have been
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
accepted to do that or not but I was
 
01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
this close and I would have like like to
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
have had that option and you know for
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
the record I don't want to die you know
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you any other
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
comments oh representative
 
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
Oregon yes I I was almost tempted to ask
 
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
for a substitute and not be here today
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
but um this is obviously as represent
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
Smith as we all know pointed out as you
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
all know we're all going to die
 
01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:19.719 align:start position:0%
eventually and some of us some people
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
die suddenly some people die gradually
 
01:16:24.189 --> 01:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
but and most people that lucky they do
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
gry gradually and they have some inkling
 
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's just days or months in
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
advance of that the end is finally going
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
to going to come and um that's always
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
been the case that's always going to be
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
the case regardless of what happens to
 
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
this pill but I think we already do
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
provide people who are near the end with
 
01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
Aid and dying and this just changes uh
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
the way we do it in a limited range of
 
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
cases you know we um many many patients
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
reach a point where any of the
 
01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
interventions that could be done to
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
prolong their life would be just as
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
likely to kill them as what they have
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
and some people some conditions aren't
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
treatable so um regardless of what we do
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
with this bill it's still a fact of life
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
that we're all going to die and many of
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
us if we're lucky we won't die suddenly
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
but we'll um you know be able to be able
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
to pass for some advanced warning and
 
01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
we're all going to need some sort of
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
most of us are going to need some sort
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
of Aid in dying regardless of what we do
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
um do with this bill and I know I've
 
01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
seen it I've seen it recently with a
 
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
family member and I've even seen it with
 
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
members of this legislature I know at
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
least a couple who I at least a couple
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
who you know some who are friends with
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
I've had to you know aid aid them in the
 
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
last uh weeks or months of their life I
 
01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't necessarily do as much as
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
I wish I had so even you know even us
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
even as New Hampshire State reps we're
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
all going to die eventually and um so I
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
think we all need some sort of Aid in
 
01:17:59.709 --> 01:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
dying so I'm I have some doubts about
 
01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
this bill but I think uh I think it's a
 
01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction and it's not
 
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
taking us off off a precipice and even
 
01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
if there is a slippery slope we're not
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know we're not required to uh go
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
down that slippery slope and we often so
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
um I probably now I'm wishing anyways
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
that I don't know if I'm making any
 
01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
sense but that's uh I think you know
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to provide people
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
near the end of their life with Aid and
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
dying anyway that's not something we
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
avoid doing so this bill just changes
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
how we do it for a certain uh limited
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
class of people so thanks any other
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
comments all right seeing none I what
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do and I'm sorry for the
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
people in the in the audience here but
 
01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
I'm as you may have noticed our clerk
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
had to had to step out because she
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
needed to be uh briefly somewhere else
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
on another bill that it seemed to me it
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
would have been unfair to not allow her
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
to do that um and that's and probably
 
01:19:01.709 --> 01:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
that's my fault because I let everybody
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
including myself drone on longer than we
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
should have perhaps but what I'm going
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
to do I I I thought it was this was an
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
important bill I thought it was
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
important for everyone to have their
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
full say we're going to take a very
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
brief recess until representative cutab
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
returns as soon as she does return we
 
01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
will then I'll then call the uh question
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
and we'll have the vote all right so
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:28:16.270 align:start position:0%
 
time

01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
all right all right I'm going to uh I
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
think everybody's back I'm going to call
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
the uh Judiciary Committee back to order
 
01:28:26.109 --> 01:28:26.119 align:start position:0%
and I believe uh everybody has now had
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to have everybody has had
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
a full chance to have their say so I'm
 
01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:34.119 align:start position:0%
now going to uh ask the clerk to call

floor my susp I mean it won't be next
 
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:30.760 align:start position:0%

01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
week after that that's F right
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
thanks right it can't be next week
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
because we can't get into tomorrow's
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
calendar in time right right right right
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
so all right um so next I'm going to
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
turn to uh house bill um
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
102 and I uh recognize uh representative
 
01:30:59.350 --> 01:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
motion I would move um uh to pass and
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to introduce an
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
amendment right is there is there is
 
01:31:13.109 --> 01:31:13.119 align:start position:0%
there a second I'll second it seconded
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
right the amendment
 
01:31:26.109 --> 01:31:26.119 align:start position:0%
is amendment number 2024
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
d930 and I'm going to pass it out to
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
everybody and I also have another paper
 
01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.709 --> 01:31:41.719 align:start position:0%
along as well
 
01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
so I take one of each
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.760 --> 01:32:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
down

01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.229 --> 01:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
also all right so the uh motion has been
 
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded and representative
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
kab would you like to speak to your
 
01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
motion I would thank you uh Mr chairman
 
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
could you give us the uh amendment
 
01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:30.910 align:start position:0%
could you give us the uh amendment
number

01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.199 --> 01:32:36.830 align:start position:0%
 
930h

01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
930h
 
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
so I believe that this amendment offers
 
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
a balanced solution to a complex problem
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
I have reached out to everybody that I
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
possibly could and worked out with
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
anybody worked with anybody that was
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
willing to come up with this and I want
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
to thank everybody that came together to
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
work on this I really do appreciate all
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
efforts at the end of the day I think
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
certain people will argue against any
 
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
change that doesn't put the entire
 
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
burden of the cost of requests to the
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and when I look at how much a
 
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
$110,000 request talks to cost to
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who have a home valuation of
 
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
500,000 in certain towns it's really
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
quite alarming and that's what this
 
01:33:19.390 --> 01:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
sheet shows
 
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
us if you look over to a town like
 
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
Roxberry one of these requests would
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
$21.30 and if you consider that somebody
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
putting in the request may not even live
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
in that District it would cost them
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
0er and when you think about the fact
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
that that's only one request what if
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
somebody were to put 10 requests into a
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
municipality like that and it were to
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
$2,382 that's really quite a bit of
 
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
money for each of those taxpayers to put
 
01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
the bill and then what if these are Big
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
requests to a charter school and you
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
consider the fact that many of these
 
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
charter schools have minimal funding and
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
they run on donations you could
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
literally shut down a charter school
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
because a request is so big and they
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the finances to pay for
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
it I went through and try to do all of
 
01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
my homework on this I read through the
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
statutes of all 50 states in regards to
 
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
the right to know laws and 42 of the
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
states charge of the eight who don't two
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
of them allow you to deny burdensome
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
requests and of the six who don't charge
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
and don't allow to deny New Hampshire
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
included they all have bills to address
 
01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
similar issues as what we're doing the
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
most free time allowed before charging
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
of the 42 states that charge is 4 hours
 
01:34:42.189 --> 01:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Nebraska give four
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
hours free this amendment allows for two
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
and a half times this with 10 hours I've
 
01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
also read through all of the cases in of
 
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
right to know cases in the New Hampshire
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
courts and I don't think that there's
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
anything more that can possibly looked
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
in be looked into at this point um there
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
is persuasive case law where it was
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
decided in the Hillsboro Superior Court
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
that two months of emails between two
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
city of nashu employees was too broad
 
01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
and the parties were ordered to meet and
 
01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
confer within 14 days to engage in a
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
goodfaith effort to narrow the focus of
 
01:35:17.229 --> 01:35:17.239 align:start position:0%
the request to both the city for the
 
01:35:19.629 --> 01:35:19.639 align:start position:0%
benefit of both the city and the
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
requestor the Supreme Court Court later
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
called out in that same case for the leg
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
legislative body to address this they
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
said quote whether limitations should be
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
imposed upon the scope of permissible
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
right to no requests or rather further
 
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
accommodations should be made in the
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
right to no law to address potentially
 
01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
unreasonably burdensome requests is an
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
issue best addressed in the first
 
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
instance by the legislature with due
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
consideration for the Mandate of part
 
01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
one article 8 of the New Hampshire
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution so what this amendment
 
01:35:52.109 --> 01:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
changes is it adds a w in here for
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
Indigent parties to ensure that
 
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
information is truly available to
 
01:35:59.070 --> 01:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
everybody and not stop because of
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
finances it requires that if a party
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
seeks a determination that the number of
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
hours may be unreasonable that a
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
determination is made by the udman or
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
the court within 10 business days it
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
also adds in a clause that b bodies
 
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
aren't liable if they act in good faith
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
to redact information if something is
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
missed we've heard from somebody
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard that some bodies are over re
 
01:36:26.669 --> 01:36:26.679 align:start position:0%
redacting Andor sending these to
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
attorneys to redact for fear of missing
 
01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
something and that's creating a backlog
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
at times with responding to requests
 
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
there's already no punishment for this
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
anyways in the Statue but this is just
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
making it crystal clear that there's no
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
liability if they act in good faith and
 
01:36:44.189 --> 01:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
they miss something it's also explicitly
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
allowing for the use of automated
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
redaction software Tools in conjunction
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
with a person spot checking it which
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
when in statues in other states some of
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
the other states are are utilizing this
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that would be a move in the
 
01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.430 align:start position:0%
and I think that would be a move in the
right

01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
direction and then it allows for a
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
charge once the time nears what has
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
already been found unreasonable by the
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
court and it encourages some
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
reconsideration or rather the request is
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate or if the parties can work
 
01:37:14.590 --> 01:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
together without cutting off somebody's
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
request to narrow it down a bit and it's
 
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
important to note that it's 10 hours a
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
month from any public body who is chosen
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
to implement this via a policy this is
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation and you don't have
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
to implement it if it's not a problem in
 
01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:29.629 align:start position:0%
to implement it if it's not a problem in
your

01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
town and the next month somebody could
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
put in another request that would also
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
reset the clock for 10 hours so this is
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
10 hours in a month um so this is a
 
01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
problem that really spans small towns to
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
large cities we had sunap senip and Keen
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
in here to testify in support we've
 
01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:52.159 align:start position:0%
received information from londondary
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
about the costs of the large request
 
01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:56.360 align:start position:0%
select boards such as Goffstown have
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
voted unanimously to support the bill
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
and what we're doing is merely giving
 
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
them optional tools that they can
 
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
discuss on a local level and debate with
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
as much Vigor as we have here and I
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
really hope that we can support this
 
01:38:12.589 --> 01:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
solution to give bodies the option to
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
use these tools and I'd like to once
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
again thank everybody who has worked
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
very hard to come up with this reason
 
01:38:24.109 --> 01:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
able solution to this complex problem
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
questions um other representative
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:38:35.589 --> 01:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
you representative I have a I have a
 
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
couple points to make I I know this
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
amendment is kind of is a um a drastic
 
01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
change from the previous Amendment
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
offered during our work session can you
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
please explain the differences between
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment you offered a couple weeks
 
01:38:52.830 --> 01:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
ago and the amendment today and then can
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
you also talk about I know in the
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
previous Amendment it talked about um
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
vexatious requests is there any sort of
 
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
um language in here that would provide a
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
solution to what we or at least Define
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
vixa request um I I'm not against the
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
bill but I think maybe perhaps we should
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
study this more as a committee um
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
throughout the summer and kind of into
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
the fall so I'm wondering can you talk
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
about the the change in the amendment
 
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
and why you you like
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
let up on it in one Amendment and then
 
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
you started you like brought it back to
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
like the original bill I feel like this
 
01:39:27.790 --> 01:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
is kind of moving it back to the
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
original bill can you talk about that a
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
little more sure thank you so nobody was
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
in support of that Amendment it was very
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
clear you you also weren't in support of
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
it so I pivoted back the other way the
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
original supporters of the original Bill
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
also W in support I talked to anybody
 
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
who was willing to work on this I think
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
I've done I don't think there's anything
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
else that could possibly be looked into
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
at this point I mean I have a
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet cataloged of all the statues
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
from all 50 states I just I don't think
 
01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
that there's anything else that can be
 
01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:53.719 align:start position:0%
looked into I think it is a complex
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
problem but I mean if there was some
 
01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
magical solution available I think one
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the 42 other states that have studied
 
01:40:00.669 --> 01:40:00.679 align:start position:0%
this before us would have found it I
 
01:40:03.070 --> 01:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
think this is the best solution I think
 
01:40:06.189 --> 01:40:06.199 align:start position:0%
again we are offering you know two and a
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
half times what the least free amount of
 
01:40:12.109 --> 01:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
time that states of charge are offering
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
they're offering four hours and many of
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
them aren't even giving that some of
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
them charge for any time at all and many
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
of them it's two hours and there's only
 
01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
two that are offering that 4H hour point
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so we did pivot back I think the
 
01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
other one the other Amendment you know
 
01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:27.639 align:start position:0%
it just got too complicated and it would
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
have put us in the place that we are now
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
which is the court constantly having to
 
01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:32.719 align:start position:0%
decide that this is unreasonable and the
 
01:40:34.189 --> 01:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
parties need to work together and I just
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's really practical
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
I think the parties should be able to
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
work together to narrow things down and
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
I think that will absolutely happen
 
01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:45.390 align:start position:0%
I think that will absolutely happen
um

01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
when they're encroaching on that 10hour
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
Mark I think parties will absolutely be
 
01:40:51.310 --> 01:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
able to come together with the town and
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
be like okay let's work on this and if
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
it's really not a malicious request and
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
I I do think it's important to note that
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know we're not nothing nothing here
 
01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
is requiring that somebody is even a
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
resident of any of anybody so people can
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
be putting in requests from Florida and
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
just using this as a literally a weapon
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
to charge up taxes for other people and
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
that just is something that I really do
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
think we need to address um nothing else
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
just that I'm aware of can you just go
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
into and and have whatever amount of
 
01:41:26.669 --> 01:41:26.679 align:start position:0%
whatever you want for free with no check
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
and balance and no vote on anything I
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
mean we vote on every single other
 
01:41:31.709 --> 01:41:31.719 align:start position:0%
budget and waren article on it but that
 
01:41:34.109 --> 01:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
you you I mean the fact that somebody
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
could even put in a hundred requests
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
into a municipality that's small and you
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
could literally have those people each
 
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
paying 20 grand and potentially losing
 
01:41:43.470 --> 01:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
their homes because they can't afford
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
that I think we just I think it makes
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
sense um so yes it is a pivot back
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
towards the original bill but it does
 
01:41:51.589 --> 01:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
address some of the concerns that were
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
brought up including the um Indigent
 
01:41:58.270 --> 01:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
clause in here and also
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
allowing for um and also explicitly
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
putting in here that the body is not
 
01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for civil damages um as long
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
as they're acting in good faith and also
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
allowing for the use of automated
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
software to produce the redactions which
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
a few other states have also put into
 
01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
their statute so that is kind of the
 
01:42:19.470 --> 01:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
reason for the pivot and if if there
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
was a agement on that other Amendment we
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
could have gone towards it but it was
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
very clear in the in the uh work session
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
that people were just not in favor of it
 
01:42:29.589 --> 01:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
so that's why that's where we ended up
 
01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
with this and um yeah thank you if I if
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
I could just follow could I just follow
 
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
up real quick sure so um what I'm so one
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
of the objections was by the New
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire press Association who is upset
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
that this bill would keep them from
 
01:42:48.669 --> 01:42:48.679 align:start position:0%
finding out information about their
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
government and holding government
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
accountable um so for in situations
 
01:42:55.629 --> 01:42:55.639 align:start position:0%
where um it's it seems like the onus is
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
requester to find to find a
 
01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
solution with with the agency to like to
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
ask for the information like to find a
 
01:43:08.589 --> 01:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
solution to narrow their scope I guess
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering like do you think that
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
this bill with a $25 an hour after 10
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
hours would hurt the ability for the
 
01:43:19.589 --> 01:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
press to access government information
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
and then disseminate to the public thank
 
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
you for that question no I do not think
 
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
it would hurt it and there were I when I
 
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
went through other State statues that
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
was not a common theme that other states
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
were including any sort of exemption for
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
that I in looking at the logs of
 
01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:37.639 align:start position:0%
requested data there were not requests
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
in those logs for from the media that
 
01:43:41.709 --> 01:43:41.719 align:start position:0%
were taking over 10 hours so no I I
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
don't think that that would have any
 
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
impact at all okay thank you yes
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative tur then and then
 
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
representative deeno thank you yeah uh
 
01:43:52.350 --> 01:43:52.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and and thanks for bringing
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment um I I was opposed to the
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
last amendment that was brought for a
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
range of reasons that that I won't go
 
01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
into but I think it definitely took us
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
in a in a the wrong direction for
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
solving this problem it it was quite
 
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
subjective in terms of having to prove
 
01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
things like vexatiousness and commercial
 
01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
use that that really aren't easily dealt
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
with um and put a lot of burden on the
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
town in terms of process that might have
 
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
even exceeded the value of the the
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
protections that it was Des desired to
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
afford um I voted for the original bill
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
that that passed our committee with a
 
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
majority um passed the house um it was
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
it was sent back to us in a
 
01:44:35.709 --> 01:44:35.719 align:start position:0%
reconsideration um and that's fine I
 
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
think the an honest effort has been made
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
to uh improve the bill in a few ways I I
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
particularly like that the the new um
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
that the the amendment offers explicit
 
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
protection for people who um would find
 
01:44:57.390 --> 01:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
the cost of of paying the fee um to be a
 
01:45:00.589 --> 01:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
financial burden the other the original
 
01:45:02.589 --> 01:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
bill I thought offered the protection of
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
the Ombudsman able to say that the town
 
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
was or or MP pality whatever it was you
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
know was ex excessively estimating the
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
cost this goes further and says not only
 
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
might it not be excessive even if they
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
making a request that that does
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
legitimately involve a large amount of
 
01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
time there must be a provision that says
 
01:45:25.629 --> 01:45:25.639 align:start position:0%
if someone's going to find that
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
financially burdensome that fee can be
 
01:45:30.189 --> 01:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
waved so I I think it affords a lot of
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
protection to the process um and I hope
 
01:45:38.350 --> 01:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
if this passes that it would not hurt
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
91a but 91a I feel is under attack to
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
some degree with these you know uses of
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
it as a tool to
 
01:45:50.910 --> 01:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
continually um put in large requests
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
with almost no sort of incentive to
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
reduce your requests um I think this
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
would make the process stronger and I
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'll will end by saying I also think
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
with the idea of automated redaction and
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
some other bills that we've heard that
 
01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
sort of say that a town has to or a
 
01:46:10.589 --> 01:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
municipality has to produce electronic
 
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
records electronically they can't sort
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
of just put it into a copying process in
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
order to increase costs um the the
 
01:46:19.589 --> 01:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
ability to upload it into an automated
 
01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
system all these things are going to
 
01:46:23.790 --> 01:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
further reduce the time that it takes to
 
01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
fill a request further reduce the number
 
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
of requests that might hit this standard
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
going forward and um you know I think
 
01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
with the new protections that are added
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know I would like to see
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
it um continue to go forward as as we
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
voted the last time with with even
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
greater safeguards thanks other comments
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ken oh I'm I'm sorry
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
okay representative D Lorenzo and then
 
01:46:52.669 --> 01:46:52.679 align:start position:0%
representative KY I apologize thank you
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and I have a question to the
 
01:46:54.159 --> 01:46:55.390 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and I have a question to the
sponsor

01:46:55.390 --> 01:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
01:46:58.910 --> 01:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm reading your chart um
 
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative kutab about the property
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
tax impact of $110,000
 
01:47:04.719 --> 01:47:06.390 align:start position:0%
tax impact of $110,000
um

01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
increase and I wanted to know first of
 
01:47:09.719 --> 01:47:10.950 align:start position:0%
increase and I wanted to know first of
all

01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
um what happens when
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
um there's a it goes through the the
 
01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
town of City attorney and
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
um that makes an impact does that impact
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
Insurance thank you for that question so
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
just um to give a little background on
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
this chart I realized that I didn't I
 
01:47:37.589 --> 01:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
downloaded this data from the Department
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
of Revenue which gives all the tax rates
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
in each town and I did choose the static
 
01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh number of a 5,000 $500,000 home
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
valuation um most of these towns are
 
01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
putting or many of these towns are
 
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
putting these larger requests out to
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
contract attorneys
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
and um so even if they have an attorney
 
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
like the city of naswa for example will
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
often put these out to a contract
 
01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:05.719 align:start position:0%
attorney because they just don't have
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
the capacity to do it all but
 
01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:09.159 align:start position:0%
particularly the smaller towns they
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
don't have an attorney on staff so
 
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's where that kind of came in from
 
01:48:15.870 --> 01:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
um we had in the log several examples of
 
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
these 10 $10,000 report quests that were
 
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
coming in and so that's why I put that
 
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
in and and I think it's important to to
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
just show that you know I think we're
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
assuming that oh these cost these these
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
are just going to cost pennies and it it
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
really doesn't and it adds up and it
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
depends on the size of the Town how much
 
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's causing and some of these I
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
think we should have a little pause when
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
a number is getting to be this high is
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
this request appropriate so thank you
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
but um just to follow up um so what
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
about when um the town's insurance pays
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
for the uh damages rather
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
than the damages being hit the town
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
budget oh so in terms of like redacting
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
the request the insurance would never
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
pay to redact the request they might pay
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
for a lawsuit with the town but they're
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
not going to pay for if somebody's
 
01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
making a right to no request they
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
Insurance wouldn't cover the cost of
 
01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
redactions that's not my question sorry
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
but this is so this this chart is
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
showing the $10,000 that that
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
they're the cost of kind of making the
 
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
the request available when you're
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
putting it to an attorney to go and
 
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
redact it so in terms of like a lawsuit
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
if the insurance picked it up I mean I
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
don't know what the impact would be
 
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
because I assume that the cost of the
 
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
insurance would increase but I didn't I
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
didn't go into that end of it well thank
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
you for your answer um that's my my
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
Prime question is how much you know
 
01:49:46.270 --> 01:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
thank you other question uh yes
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny uh well I have a
 
01:49:51.550 --> 01:49:51.560 align:start position:0%
just a comment so I'm I'm on um this
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
amendment too and I do no matter where
 
01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
you fall on this issue I do urge you to
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
support the amendment um even if you
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
don't support otpa because I think this
 
01:50:02.350 --> 01:50:02.360 align:start position:0%
amendment does um improve the original
 
01:50:04.990 --> 01:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
bill um so I've struggled with this more
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
than I've struggled um on most bills in
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
the past six years I want to start by
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
saying that I know how much work the
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor has put into this uh
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative cutab is does her
 
01:50:20.189 --> 01:50:20.199 align:start position:0%
homework she knows this inside and out
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
um you know and I've worked with her and
 
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
any question I've had she was able to
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
answer and I truly applaud her ability
 
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
to work across the aisle um and her work
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
ethic in general initially I was itl and
 
01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
I will concede that I have accepted that
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
there is an issue and that perhaps the
 
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
legislature could uh Implement something
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
that fully resolves it um but answers to
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
concerns of the other side I truly was
 
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
going to support
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
otpa um but then I started talking to
 
01:50:54.069 --> 01:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
committee members and it did seem like
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
many were unsure going back and forth um
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
confused on some parts of it uh and many
 
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
did Express the sentiment that they
 
01:51:05.669 --> 01:51:05.679 align:start position:0%
would like to continue to work on it uh
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
to be transparent this would be a huge
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
change to 91a except the on budsman
 
01:51:12.589 --> 01:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest one that I would
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
see in my six years so far um everyone
 
01:51:19.709 --> 01:51:19.719 align:start position:0%
has admitted how complex this issue is
 
01:51:19.719 --> 01:51:20.709 align:start position:0%
has admitted how complex this issue is
um

01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
and this amendment did answer some of my
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
main concerns but I know there are other
 
01:51:28.589 --> 01:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
valid concerns out there and I want this
 
01:51:30.510 --> 01:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
committee to be able to be confident in
 
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
their position and take the time to look
 
01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
into something so complex and although
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor has um I know we've
 
01:51:40.750 --> 01:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
had a lot of work and when that happens
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
historically it is Justified to study it
 
01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
and allow the stakeholders and people
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
who are interested to come together and
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
um continue to try to find a
 
01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
solution so I I know I will upset some
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
people with my vote today um but I do
 
01:52:01.470 --> 01:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to pass the amendment
 
01:52:04.109 --> 01:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
but then not support otpa but also not
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
support itl only support an interim
 
01:52:09.310 --> 01:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
study um so we can hash this out keep
 
01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:11.639 align:start position:0%
looking at it I promise this is in good
 
01:52:13.229 --> 01:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
faith I'll continue to work at good
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
faith with the stakeholders um but I
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
think a lot of compelling points have
 
01:52:20.910 --> 01:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
been brought to us and when we're
 
01:52:23.709 --> 01:52:23.719 align:start position:0%
changing 91a in this manner let's not
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
rush it there is no rush thank you other
 
01:52:30.669 --> 01:52:30.679 align:start position:0%
comments uh representative
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
Perez first of all I am very much aware
 
01:52:36.669 --> 01:52:36.679 align:start position:0%
that this bill is a London Dairy bill
 
01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
that came to cause because of London der
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
um and I when I was the only rep in
 
01:52:47.069 --> 01:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
londondary that voted against it I
 
01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
wondered why and then I found out why
 
01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
okay um I have a couple of questions on
 
01:52:55.629 --> 01:52:55.639 align:start position:0%
it what how do we Define financial
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
hardship I mean the stock market went
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
way down yesterday I could consider
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
myself a financial hardship because of
 
01:53:05.790 --> 01:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
that you know I don't I'd like that how
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
do we Define that the other is multiple
 
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
requests from any person or entity to
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
the same public body within 30-day time
 
01:53:15.310 --> 01:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
periods is one
 
01:53:17.709 --> 01:53:17.719 align:start position:0%
request that I have an issue with
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
because with um town meetings and
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard meetings coming up
 
01:53:26.109 --> 01:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
fortunately I haven't had to put in a
 
01:53:28.589 --> 01:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
91a request because they're pretty good
 
01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
about getting back to me but I know I've
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
asked for information probably in the
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
past month six or seven times from the
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh SAU office and probably three or four
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
times from the
 
01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:45.310 align:start position:0%
times from the
town

01:53:45.310 --> 01:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
um I I that I have a concern about
 
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
because when you get
 
01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
information from one thing that often
 
01:53:57.870 --> 01:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
makes you have to go deeper to find out
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
the next thing so I have a concern about
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
about that um I think and I think this
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
is great to do this but what I would
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
have liked to have seen is in the past
 
01:54:14.069 --> 01:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
12 months how much have towns spent
 
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
on on a 91a now I happen to I happen to
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
have spoken to a Town
 
01:54:24.589 --> 01:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
counselor in londondary londondary has
 
01:54:24.599 --> 01:54:25.790 align:start position:0%
counselor in londondary londondary has
never

01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
never
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
spent more than 10 hours much less on
 
01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:30.990 align:start position:0%
spent more than 10 hours much less on
any

01:54:30.990 --> 01:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
individual's um right to know the
 
01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
average is three hours
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay the problem they had is that um
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
Kevin Smith was our town manager for
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
eight or nine years and then he ran for
 
01:54:49.229 --> 01:54:49.239 align:start position:0%
um Senate and they had 91a coming in
 
01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
from all over the United States and both
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
both parties that was a huge thing but
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
year they haven't spent much as far as I
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
know on 91a so I mean are we fixing a
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
problem that isn't there or are we
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
fixing a problem that might be there
 
01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
only for one or two communities so
 
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
um I I would like to see it looked at
 
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
I'd like to really see how much people
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
are spending I mean I can't believe that
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
some of these little towns are spending
 
01:55:24.639 --> 01:55:25.589 align:start position:0%
some of these little towns are spending
over

01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:55:29.350 --> 01:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
$110,000 on um 91 a and then there's the
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
question why do they use a
 
01:55:35.109 --> 01:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
lawyer when I can get my questions
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
answered by calling up and saying gee
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
would you give me the numbers on
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
this why are they using lawyers to do
 
01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
this now London da may be using a lawyer
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
because they've had multiple lawsuits
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
not connected with
 
01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:58.719 align:start position:0%
91a but recently but I just I I I just I
 
01:56:00.189 --> 01:56:00.199 align:start position:0%
want to see it cleaned up a little bit
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
more I think Caitlyn it's a great job
 
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you got rid of the one you had
 
01:56:08.430 --> 01:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
last time but maybe we can add in outof
 
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
state entities maybe that's one because
 
01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
it was the outof state entities that
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
were causing the problem I know
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
in during Kevin Smith CER all right uh
 
01:56:23.709 --> 01:56:23.719 align:start position:0%
my representative Andress and then
 
01:56:23.719 --> 01:56:28.310 align:start position:0%
my representative Andress and then
representative

01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
trip thank you Mr chair uh Kaitlyn has
 
01:56:35.550 --> 01:56:35.560 align:start position:0%
done a great job on all the background
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
work but I agree with my colleagues I
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
think this needs inm study this is a
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
complex issue this isn't something that
 
01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
we can throw through and Well
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to be happy at the
 
01:56:50.229 --> 01:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
other end there there are so many
 
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
questions and what is I think a
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
committee ha is needed I've asked people
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
questions I think each one of us on this
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
committee have probably asked others
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
question or obtained
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
information but the whole committee
 
01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have all the information I hope
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm trying to say
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
and I really question if this is still
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional I realize there's some
 
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
problems out
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
there but to me it's just certain towns
 
01:57:29.229 --> 01:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
or cities why do we punish everybody in
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire if there's
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
only a few problems I mean most towns
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
small towns I've heard of I've never
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
heard of any problem with 91a request
 
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
and uh I have a couple of questions on
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
here I'd love to give to Caitlyn on the
 
01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.830 align:start position:0%
here I'd love to give to Caitlyn on the
amendment

01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
what does
 
01:57:56.189 --> 01:57:56.199 align:start position:0%
reasonably described
 
01:57:59.950 --> 01:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
mean and at the bottom of page one where
 
01:58:02.669 --> 01:58:02.679 align:start position:0%
it says any public body agency may
 
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
suggest to the request a reasonable
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
modification that is a pretty broad
 
01:58:11.550 --> 01:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
statement I've Done Right to no request
 
01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
before and
 
01:58:17.669 --> 01:58:17.679 align:start position:0%
you if the requestor isn't sure what I
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
want they ask me to be specific and I
 
01:58:26.589 --> 01:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
think because I believe that if an
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
agency tries to
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
modify then the requester may not be
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
getting all the information they need
 
01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
and they'll have to go back again and
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
then on page
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
two F the lot the agency responsibility
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
what does that paragraph mean uh cuz I
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't quite sure thanks right
 
01:58:53.069 --> 01:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
representative trip oh I'm sorry did you
 
01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead sure I'm sorry goad so
 
01:58:56.589 --> 01:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
they're reasonably described I agree
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
with you that that's that's a very
 
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
ambiguous statement but that's currently
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
what is already in law I'm not changing
 
01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
that at all and in looking back in the
 
01:59:08.589 --> 01:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
2020 legisl legislative session there
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
was a lot of back and forth and it was
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
they tried to come up with a better
 
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
definition and they just could not get
 
01:59:15.310 --> 01:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
agreement on it so it was left it
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
reasonably described and
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:59:23.069 --> 01:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
think I think if you want me to be
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
honest what I've heard from some towns
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
at this point is that when they are
 
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
getting requests that they consider to
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
be huge requests some of the towns are
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
saying well it's not reasonably
 
01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
described you need to reasonably
 
01:59:35.069 --> 01:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
describe it and they're not denying the
 
01:59:37.229 --> 01:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
request they're just saying describe it
 
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
better and it's a ping pong back and
 
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
forth and if if the party won't do that
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
then they end up in court um but there
 
01:59:47.229 --> 01:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
is no definition of what's reasonably
 
01:59:48.990 --> 01:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
described and I you know I think that is
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
part part of the problem but that's not
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
a problem that I'm addressing in here
 
01:59:57.790 --> 01:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
and um in regards to the paragraph F
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
that was about the fact that it was
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
brought up that some bodies are over
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
racting because they're nervous about
 
02:00:06.189 --> 02:00:06.199 align:start position:0%
getting sued and we heard that testimony
 
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:09.560 align:start position:0%
over and over and there was a
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
a kind representative from nasua who's
 
02:00:15.790 --> 02:00:15.800 align:start position:0%
an attorney um that does right to no
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
request in mass in New Hampshire and
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out um um that this they're
 
02:00:22.109 --> 02:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
putting something in here that
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
explicitly states that they wouldn't be
 
02:00:26.910 --> 02:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
civil liable if they're acting in good
 
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
faith and they Mis racting something
 
02:00:32.510 --> 02:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
would help to you know resolve some of
 
02:00:34.109 --> 02:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
it as well as allowing them to use
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
automated software to produce redactions
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
um which is in a few other State statues
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what that paragraph is
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
is regarding so thank you all right
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative uh trip and then
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan uh thank you Mr
 
02:00:48.119 --> 02:00:49.669 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan uh thank you Mr
chair

02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:00:54.589 --> 02:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
I uh I think the amendment is uh greatly
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
improved I like the
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh the sentence on
 
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh 12- 15 where uh uh if they're not
 
02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:09.639 align:start position:0%
going to provide the uh uh requests
 
02:01:11.550 --> 02:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
within five days that they provide an
 
02:01:15.069 --> 02:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
estimate of the cost of making a record
 
02:01:19.390 --> 02:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
uh within 5 days I think uh that in
 
02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:21.639 align:start position:0%
conjunction with
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
the on page two lines uh 15 and 16 where
 
02:01:31.149 --> 02:01:31.159 align:start position:0%
uh you make the statement that uh prior
 
02:01:34.629 --> 02:01:34.639 align:start position:0%
to charging any fees that the agency
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
creates a policy so that the practices
 
02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:38.030 align:start position:0%
creates a policy so that the practices
are

02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
transparent uniform and consistent
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
because if you don't know what the the
 
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh agency is going to use for is uh
 
02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
metrics for producing these records
 
02:01:56.069 --> 02:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh the estimate they give you on uh the
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
first page means nothing I think that uh
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
having a policy that is transparent
 
02:02:07.950 --> 02:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
uniform and consistent would Aid
 
02:02:12.030 --> 02:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
immensely in people uh defining what
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
they is what it is that they want on the
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
91a uh request uh I'm a little uncertain
 
02:02:23.790 --> 02:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
as to what transparent uniform and
 
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
consistent actually means
 
02:02:29.950 --> 02:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
could could you provide some guidance
 
02:02:32.669 --> 02:02:32.679 align:start position:0%
here yeah so the intent behind that is
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
so that people can see what exactly that
 
02:02:37.709 --> 02:02:37.719 align:start position:0%
the policy is so that it is that's the
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
transparent part about it the uniform
 
02:02:41.830 --> 02:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
part about it was there was concern that
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
some people were were worried that you
 
02:02:48.270 --> 02:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
know hey I I really like Alex but I I
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
don't like Tim so I'm gonna charge Tim
 
02:02:52.589 --> 02:02:52.599 align:start position:0%
more than I'm going to charge Alex
 
02:02:55.470 --> 02:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
because I don't like I don't like him um
 
02:02:56.669 --> 02:02:56.679 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure that that's not
 
02:02:58.109 --> 02:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
happening we should you know things
 
02:03:00.830 --> 02:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
should be uniform so that we don't have
 
02:03:02.430 --> 02:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
inconsistent practices and we're not
 
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
charging one person more than the other
 
02:03:09.189 --> 02:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
 
02:03:14.069 --> 02:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
the I guess as you were asking that I
 
02:03:16.149 --> 02:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
remember that rep Perez had asked about
 
02:03:17.950 --> 02:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
the definition of a financial hardship
 
02:03:20.109 --> 02:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
that has to be within your the public
 
02:03:22.830 --> 02:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
body's policy as well so this is you
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
know given the the public body you know
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
just as they they Implement policies on
 
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know um tax AB abatements um they'd
 
02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
be implementing a policy on how they're
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
going to how they're going to go move
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
forward with this so that's I think it
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
is really important to have a policy
 
02:03:42.069 --> 02:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
like this before just deciding that
 
02:03:43.390 --> 02:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to charge and remember that
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
this is this is enabling so bodies don't
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
have to if it's not a problem in a town
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
they don't have have to implement this
 
02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
so Selectmen don't have to vote to
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
implement a policy and it's if they do
 
02:03:57.069 --> 02:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
choose to implement a policy it's up to
 
02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
25 an hour so that body may say hey we
 
02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
only want to charge people $5 an hour
 
02:04:03.030 --> 02:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know this is all enabling and and
 
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
giving that choice to the local level
 
02:04:08.350 --> 02:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
control when there are these more
 
02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
problematic areas so I think that that's
 
02:04:11.950 --> 02:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
really important that we we do keep
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
things Fair representative
 
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
orgon well we've mostly talking about
 
02:04:19.470 --> 02:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities and unfor fortunately
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
even if we pass this bill with the
 
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
amendment um there's still going to be
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
cases of long running disputes between a
 
02:04:29.229 --> 02:04:29.239 align:start position:0%
citizen and you know their town or city
 
02:04:31.629 --> 02:04:31.639 align:start position:0%
which maybe can never really be solved
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
because a lot of times the right to know
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
request people seem people uh are
 
02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
looking for information which may not
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
even in fact exist or if it does exist
 
02:04:42.629 --> 02:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't prove what they want it to do
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
but this also applies at other levels of
 
02:04:48.430 --> 02:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
government I know there's a uh issue
 
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
I've been working on which luckily
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't hasn't involved this committee
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
with a particular State program that was
 
02:04:58.270 --> 02:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
is basically being administered by a
 
02:05:00.030 --> 02:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
contractor there's a lot of questions
 
02:05:01.990 --> 02:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
about how the contractor operates and
 
02:05:03.709 --> 02:05:03.719 align:start position:0%
why they were chosen
 
02:05:06.109 --> 02:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
and those type of issues sometimes you
 
02:05:08.589 --> 02:05:08.599 align:start position:0%
do need a wide- ranging uh right to no
 
02:05:12.189 --> 02:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
request because the uh it's at least
 
02:05:15.549 --> 02:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
there's the appearance sometimes that
 
02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
the that the government body is actually
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
added acting in a way deliberately
 
02:05:22.350 --> 02:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
designed to try to Shield itself from
 
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
91a and from public scrutiny so those so
 
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
there are probably are cases where
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
legitimately you do need to make a very
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
broad request in order to find out uh
 
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
what's going on whether all the whether
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
all of those whether that's I mean
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's not necess true of all the cases
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
where somebody's making a very wide-
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
ranging request but there are some cases
 
02:05:44.350 --> 02:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
where that's a legitimate thing to do so
 
02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:45.310 align:start position:0%
where that's a legitimate thing to do so
I

02:05:45.310 --> 02:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:05:49.069 --> 02:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
um not sure if this we probably do need
 
02:05:50.669 --> 02:05:50.679 align:start position:0%
to improve the law somewhere but I'm not
 
02:05:52.750 --> 02:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
sure whether this bill is the right way
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
to deal with h situations where somebody
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
either legitimately or illegitimately
 
02:05:59.950 --> 02:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
has a very broad area of concern with
 
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
how the public body is working and as I
 
02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
said it's we're talking about the towns
 
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
and cities but it's not not just the
 
02:06:07.709 --> 02:06:07.719 align:start position:0%
towns and cities which sometimes have
 
02:06:10.669 --> 02:06:10.679 align:start position:0%
this issue with the interest with the
 
02:06:13.470 --> 02:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
members of the public so I I would
 
02:06:15.069 --> 02:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
representative I think representative KH
 
02:06:16.629 --> 02:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
do you have your hand up
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman I
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
um served as a selectman for 15 years
 
02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
from 2008 to
 
02:06:31.709 --> 02:06:31.719 align:start position:0%
2023 in Seabrook I saw many time I fa
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
this kind of situation that uh
 
02:06:36.830 --> 02:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
especially right before Town election
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
around this time of the year uh uh many
 
02:06:43.470 --> 02:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
many you know people who wants to run
 
02:06:45.790 --> 02:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
against each other
 
02:06:49.629 --> 02:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
usually um uh requested many of these
 
02:06:52.350 --> 02:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
documents that the whole uh
 
02:06:54.629 --> 02:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
Administration is top of it you know
 
02:06:56.549 --> 02:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
they they left all the work and just
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
doing this kind of job I think some of
 
02:07:03.629 --> 02:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
the uh comment I just heard and not
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
knowing the the testimony I was not here
 
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
I think that more work need to be done
 
02:07:13.950 --> 02:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative could did a lot of
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
work you know it's a tremendous work but
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
I think more need to be worked uh that
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
is my comment thank you Mr chairman
 
02:07:21.549 --> 02:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton did you have
 
02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
your hand up yes I did thank you uh Mr
 
02:07:29.470 --> 02:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
chair um page one um line 28 uh
 
02:07:34.109 --> 02:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
parenthetical e um may suggest uh key
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
word there uh I like that that suggests
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
communication we can solve a lot of
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
problems with communication and that
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
that offers that opportunity to do so um
 
02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
request a reasonable modification
 
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
again um may suggest and it U puts
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
qualification on um what they might
 
02:08:00.270 --> 02:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
suggest um and I think again
 
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
communication is is key why lawyers are
 
02:08:08.149 --> 02:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
involved increasingly because councils
 
02:08:11.069 --> 02:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
and uh select boards are increasingly
 
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
worried about the liability for
 
02:08:16.709 --> 02:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
disclosure of confidential or private
 
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
information and so might do a cursory or
 
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
an initial review but then they're going
 
02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
to bounce it up against the lawyer for
 
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
the safety and protection of that so
 
02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
that they're not incurring a liability
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
and I know in Claremont we had a
 
02:08:36.430 --> 02:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
particular case where uh lawyers did um
 
02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
redaction and so forth and I think a
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
thing came at about
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
$23,000 lawyers are expensive you know
 
02:08:47.310 --> 02:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
130 150 125 bucks an hour it don't come
 
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
cheap but the need is increasingly there
 
02:08:54.030 --> 02:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
because of the fear of liability issues
 
02:08:56.510 --> 02:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
so we need this is a balanced and
 
02:08:59.149 --> 02:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable thing for both parties and I
 
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
think um we should go forward with it
 
02:09:04.109 --> 02:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
and get it underway right representative
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
Alexan did you have any representative
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you Mr chair
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
um representative kab has put in Yan's
 
02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
work into this into this amendment and I
 
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
I applaud her her work uh I'm concerned
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
about some of the more underlying and
 
02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
basic issues here which is that the
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman expires I think it's within
 
02:09:31.709 --> 02:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
two years and also the cities and towns
 
02:09:34.950 --> 02:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me the cities and towns are not
 
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
authorized to go to the Ombudsman to try
 
02:09:41.549 --> 02:09:41.559 align:start position:0%
to resolve some of these issues and so I
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
would also be supportive of interim
 
02:09:46.229 --> 02:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
study so that we can look at some of the
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
more basic issues and so that we can um
 
02:09:53.229 --> 02:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
as rep Kenny said uh bring together the
 
02:09:57.149 --> 02:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders and um and look at this
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
in much more detail and maybe look at
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
some of the more basic issues underlying
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
The Spill right all right I guess um I'm
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh I I mentioned this to representative
 
02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
cutab before uh that I've got I'm
 
02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
working now on my recommendation of her
 
02:10:18.030 --> 02:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
uh enrollment in law school and one of
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
the because she obviously will do a
 
02:10:23.310 --> 02:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
tremendous job there and one of the
 
02:10:25.470 --> 02:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
things that will be one it will be her
 
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
strongest selling point is that um she's
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
willing to go to work for one of these
 
02:10:34.830 --> 02:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
big firms uh working tremendous hours uh
 
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
and uh for the for the poultry sum of
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
$100 a year for for compensation um I I
 
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:10:47.950 --> 02:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
this I I guess I can't I can't help
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
thinking that we I think we sort of need
 
02:10:55.549 --> 02:10:55.559 align:start position:0%
to reflect where we came from my we the
 
02:10:58.870 --> 02:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
the house originally passed this bill
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
and then it was it was committed for
 
02:11:05.470 --> 02:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
reconsideration because people said that
 
02:11:07.229 --> 02:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
there were additional factors that ought
 
02:11:10.589 --> 02:11:10.599 align:start position:0%
to be taken up well we did take up those
 
02:11:12.510 --> 02:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
additional factors we had a number of
 
02:11:16.030 --> 02:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
amendments that were considered um and
 
02:11:19.549 --> 02:11:19.559 align:start position:0%
rejected um uh everybody sort of had
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
their opportunity to have their say and
 
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
I think as representative turr pointed
 
02:11:26.109 --> 02:11:26.119 align:start position:0%
out and representative Stapleton pointed
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
out this does make substantial changes
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
to the original bill in the in the
 
02:11:34.750 --> 02:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
direction it seems to me of the people
 
02:11:39.629 --> 02:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
who said um you know this is uh who who
 
02:11:41.310 --> 02:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
had the view of well there should never
 
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
be any charge um this does make a number
 
02:11:49.669 --> 02:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
of of uh of uh concessions going that
 
02:11:52.229 --> 02:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
way it it certainly does retain the the
 
02:11:54.990 --> 02:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
option of having uh charges if towns
 
02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
decide to do that but um it uh it has
 
02:12:01.549 --> 02:12:01.559 align:start position:0%
the Indigent exception which uh I think
 
02:12:04.350 --> 02:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
is is is an important step in that
 
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
direction um and and the other thing I
 
02:12:09.149 --> 02:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
think is really important is there is
 
02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
there a provision that changes the
 
02:12:16.589 --> 02:12:16.599 align:start position:0%
burden of proof uh to uh uh the public
 
02:12:19.870 --> 02:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
body um where if there's if if a matter
 
02:12:23.470 --> 02:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
goes before the um budsman so I think
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
um that this that this is a very
 
02:12:29.629 --> 02:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate amendment I really don't
 
02:12:33.310 --> 02:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
think that um there's any likelihood of
 
02:12:35.709 --> 02:12:35.719 align:start position:0%
further study result you know coming up
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
with some uh some additional uh uh
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
benefit and that really we're just
 
02:12:45.790 --> 02:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
interim study means we're just going to
 
02:12:47.549 --> 02:12:47.559 align:start position:0%
it's a it's going to end up being
 
02:12:49.870 --> 02:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
frankly a plight way of killing this
 
02:12:52.510 --> 02:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
bill the last point I would make on this
 
02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
is this you know the idea of charging in
 
02:13:01.390 --> 02:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
some circumstances for requests is as
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative cutab pointed out from
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
her Rec this is hardly like a novel idea
 
02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
oh my God New Hampshire is doing you
 
02:13:10.549 --> 02:13:10.559 align:start position:0%
know is is taking this giant step that's
 
02:13:12.669 --> 02:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
just not true at all it's what we're
 
02:13:15.669 --> 02:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
doing is is consistent with what's been
 
02:13:18.430 --> 02:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
done around the country um and in fact
 
02:13:20.589 --> 02:13:20.599 align:start position:0%
we're still as as she pointed out we're
 
02:13:22.750 --> 02:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
still by having the 10hour thing as
 
02:13:25.629 --> 02:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
opposed to two or four we're being much
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
more generous so I I think that we owe
 
02:13:34.189 --> 02:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
it to the taxpayers to adopt something
 
02:13:36.510 --> 02:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
like this and I will I will be voting in
 
02:13:41.549 --> 02:13:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:44.069 --> 02:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
Andrew thank you Mr chair I got a
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
question uh representative kab on on the
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
amendment number on the second page
 
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral
 
02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
8 where was that information that part
 
02:14:00.910 --> 02:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill taken from because it
 
02:14:04.350 --> 02:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't go along with the original Bill
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what I thought we were
 
02:14:09.470 --> 02:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
confused thank you for the question so
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
this piece was um in this piece was part
 
02:14:17.069 --> 02:14:17.079 align:start position:0%
of the original Bill there were a few
 
02:14:20.510 --> 02:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
changes to this line um and one of them
 
02:14:22.669 --> 02:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
actually addresses kind of what R Manos
 
02:14:24.430 --> 02:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
was talking about instead of just
 
02:14:27.149 --> 02:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
allowing to go to the udman RSA 91 a7b
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
gives the option to go to the udman or
 
02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
the court should the udman office go
 
02:14:34.030 --> 02:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
away for some reason it it would provide
 
02:14:37.709 --> 02:14:37.719 align:start position:0%
that alternative alternative option um
 
02:14:40.109 --> 02:14:40.119 align:start position:0%
so I think that piece in there was
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
changed and then the other piece that
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
was changed was adding in the line about
 
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
the burden shall be on the public body
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
and establishing that the hours and
 
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
Andor costs to make the records
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
available are reasonable and that a
 
02:14:53.790 --> 02:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
determination shall be made within 10
 
02:14:55.549 --> 02:14:55.559 align:start position:0%
business days both of those things were
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
added but the other pieces oh and I'm
 
02:15:00.669 --> 02:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
sorry the other piece that was added was
 
02:15:04.510 --> 02:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
also on line 17 to include a provision
 
02:15:06.030 --> 02:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
for the waiver of such fees for
 
02:15:08.109 --> 02:15:08.119 align:start position:0%
requesters who are deemed Indigent
 
02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
Indigent or who can demonstrate that
 
02:15:11.950 --> 02:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
such fees would present a financial
 
02:15:13.870 --> 02:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
hardship those were the areas that were
 
02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
added to this paragraph but that
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph did exist
 
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
in the initial bill we've just made
 
02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
these these changes to it right other um
 
02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:24.950 align:start position:0%
these these changes to it right other um
representative

02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
tur yeah just just one more thing I
 
02:15:30.549 --> 02:15:30.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to sort of uh bring out as as we
 
02:15:33.109 --> 02:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
were working this past week to sort of
 
02:15:35.229 --> 02:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
refine amendments and I I had some input
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
into this um you know one thing and and
 
02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm speaking to the question of
 
02:15:42.270 --> 02:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
interim study even though that's not
 
02:15:44.189 --> 02:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
really moved yet um it's been sort of
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
brought up um in terms of what could be
 
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
known you know
 
02:15:52.189 --> 02:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
working from this original base of this
 
02:15:53.870 --> 02:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
you know we had a survey that was done
 
02:15:56.470 --> 02:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
by the municipal Association so we had a
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
baseline for cities and towns and sort
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
of what their experience had been um I
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
became concerned when I realized oh I
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
hadn't really been focusing on the
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
state's uh agencies and requests to
 
02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
State agencies which I raised with
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative cutab and and again to
 
02:16:15.549 --> 02:16:15.559 align:start position:0%
add on to everyone's uh accolades for
 
02:16:17.310 --> 02:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
the work that went into this she then
 
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
turned around and I believe and correct
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong contacted people at the
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
state who fill state level 91a requests
 
02:16:28.109 --> 02:16:28.119 align:start position:0%
um who also basically said very little
 
02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
of what they do would be would would
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
would break through the 10hour um limit
 
02:16:36.429 --> 02:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
for reasonable requests so you know I
 
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
was pretty adamant we shouldn't move
 
02:16:40.589 --> 02:16:40.599 align:start position:0%
something from at the state agency level
 
02:16:42.910 --> 02:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
unless we sort of knew that put my my
 
02:16:45.790 --> 02:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
fears of that as well you know to rest
 
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
so I I really feel like a great deal of
 
02:16:50.429 --> 02:16:50.439 align:start position:0%
knowledge is on the table right now the
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
next time through I'm not sure what
 
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to basically be able to add
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
to what we what we know all right anyone
 
02:16:58.750 --> 02:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
else have anything to say representative
 
02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:01.599 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you um Mr chair first
 
02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
because I am a very active advocate for
 
02:17:09.389 --> 02:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
privacy I just would like to know if the
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
incredibly wonderful representative gave
 
02:17:14.429 --> 02:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
you permission to tell everybody what
 
02:17:17.389 --> 02:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
her future plans are uh that's the first
 
02:17:19.950 --> 02:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
question question um the second is I
 
02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
plan to support the amendment because I
 
02:17:28.030 --> 02:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
support the work that the representative
 
02:17:34.990 --> 02:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
has done I consider it um uh the least
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
bad alternative presented to us um but I
 
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
do not believe in the end I would be
 
02:17:43.549 --> 02:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
able to support the bill as amended
 
02:17:45.309 --> 02:17:45.319 align:start position:0%
thank you all right all right are we
 
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
ready for vote on the amendment and I
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
think probably we ought to do this by I
 
02:17:52.110 --> 02:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
don't know what do you think any anybody
 
02:17:54.030 --> 02:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
object to doing the amendment by a show
 
02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:55.750 align:start position:0%
object to doing the amendment by a show
of

02:17:55.750 --> 02:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:17:57.950 --> 02:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
hands all right seeing none all right
 
02:17:59.870 --> 02:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of the amendment
 
02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
please raise your
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
hand go ah have one two three five six 7

12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 19 19 to uh one
 
02:18:17.399 --> 02:18:19.389 align:start position:0%

move otpa as as amended is there a
 
02:18:55.070 --> 02:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
second representative Stapleton second
 
02:18:58.309 --> 02:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
Stapleton all right uh any further

discussion I could bring up one more
 
02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:07.030 align:start position:0%
discussion I could bring up one more
Point

02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
Point
 
02:19:09.669 --> 02:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
certainly so um I realized that I didn't
 
02:19:09.679 --> 02:19:11.709 align:start position:0%
certainly so um I realized that I didn't
answer

02:19:11.709 --> 02:19:11.719 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
um rep Perez's question about why
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes lawyers are involved and I
 
02:19:18.349 --> 02:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
guess it's it's often because of the
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
complexity of redactions that are needed
 
02:19:21.389 --> 02:19:21.399 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about giving over
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes and stuff that's an easy
 
02:19:25.070 --> 02:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
thing we can easily give over meeting
 
02:19:27.549 --> 02:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
minutes financial data it's when we're
 
02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
talking about asking for wide ranges of
 
02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
email records and somebody needs to go
 
02:19:36.190 --> 02:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
through and redact um I know in goof
 
02:19:37.309 --> 02:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
toown it was mentioned they go through
 
02:19:38.750 --> 02:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
and they redact the person's phone
 
02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
number out of the email and whatnot like
 
02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
things that aren't necessarily meant to
 
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
be public if somebody has their social
 
02:19:46.349 --> 02:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
security number in an email you you
 
02:19:48.270 --> 02:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
never know what's in these emails and so
 
02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
they have to go through and when
 
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's asking for a pretty
 
02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
open-ended number of
 
02:19:55.230 --> 02:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
emails they need to be gone through and
 
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
they need to see what what needs to be
 
02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
taken out so that's why sometimes a
 
02:20:00.510 --> 02:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
lawyer is involved in going through to
 
02:20:02.309 --> 02:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
see what does or doesn't need to be
 
02:20:04.830 --> 02:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
redacted and I think that's really the
 
02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
area that's that's problematic so thank
 
02:20:09.870 --> 02:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:20:12.990 --> 02:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
Perez I understand now the redacting
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
because I spoke with someone at the Town
 
02:20:17.389 --> 02:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
Hall about it and they don't have the
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
lawyer do the redacting it's my I mean
 
02:20:21.950 --> 02:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
why would you pay a lawyer $450 to take
 
02:20:23.950 --> 02:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
out somebody's name address and phone
 
02:20:26.670 --> 02:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
number but that being said I have a
 
02:20:29.630 --> 02:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
question uh the ACLU was against the
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
original bill and I believe the 91a
 
02:20:35.070 --> 02:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
people were do you know where they stand
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:20:39.870 --> 02:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
amendment yes so they they had agreed
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
with another amendment and um but the
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee didn't support that on this
 
02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
amendment they're not in support of it
 
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
um uh londondary is using Shaheen and
 
02:20:52.630 --> 02:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
Finny at $400 an hour for redactions um
 
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
so I so that's a choice they don't have
 
02:20:57.429 --> 02:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
correct um that is a choice to use but I
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
mean I guess they need somebody to
 
02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
redact the record somebody's asked
 
02:21:06.270 --> 02:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's making the choice to put in
 
02:21:07.870 --> 02:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
the request so they've got to fulfill
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
the request somehow yeah all right um
 
02:21:13.349 --> 02:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
all right we ready for a vote on the
 
02:21:15.309 --> 02:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
main oh I'm sorry representative Oregon
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to say about the
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
redaction it's useful that somebody has
 
02:21:20.910 --> 02:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
experience with redaction because it's
 
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
not as simple as you uh as you think
 
02:21:25.790 --> 02:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
like there's aming incident um I think
 
02:21:27.309 --> 02:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
it was the frm Scandal I can't remember
 
02:21:30.429 --> 02:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
it was about where um they they
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
carefully blacked out everything on the
 
02:21:35.429 --> 02:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
PDF files so was blacked out from the
 
02:21:38.349 --> 02:21:38.359 align:start position:0%
printed version and then they put the
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
PDF files that they use to make the
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
printouts online and so if you happen to
 
02:21:44.349 --> 02:21:44.359 align:start position:0%
use the text to spech feature you could
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
hear all the stuff that had the black
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
bar over it just because they made
 
02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
whoever it was made a mistake when they
 
02:21:52.429 --> 02:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
were editing the files and also another
 
02:21:55.389 --> 02:21:55.399 align:start position:0%
issue is it's not just things that are
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
generated by the public body themselves
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and we've seen this sometimes here in
 
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature including this committee
 
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
people will submit
 
02:22:06.429 --> 02:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
things to the body including uh
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
legislative committee sometimes that has
 
02:22:10.270 --> 02:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
information that's not redacted which
 
02:22:12.030 --> 02:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
probably should be redacted so when
 
02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
we're making so sometime when the body
 
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
is making the record of what so these
 
02:22:20.030 --> 02:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
records often include things that other
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
parties have uh submitted to it which
 
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
may or may not have been appropriately
 
02:22:25.630 --> 02:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
redacted when they were received you
 
02:22:28.510 --> 02:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
know like I think this committee uh I
 
02:22:29.950 --> 02:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
think we can all easily think of an
 
02:22:31.710 --> 02:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
example with a bill we're not doing at
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
the moment where we a citizen gave us a
 
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
big pile of paper which had lots of
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
information that maybe should have been
 
02:22:42.030 --> 02:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
redacted but wasn't some I that's why
 
02:22:44.670 --> 02:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
all right are we ready for a a vote all
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
right um then on the motion of ought to
 
02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
pass uh as amended I ask the clerk to
 
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.600 align:start position:0%

02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
um any further any further discussion on
 
02:24:29.269 --> 02:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
this or are we ready to vote I mean I
 
02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
guess I'm just not sure what we're going
 
02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
to learn in an interm study I think
 
02:24:33.950 --> 02:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
we've kind of beat this horse and I'm
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
just you know I I'm not sure what what
 
02:24:38.309 --> 02:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
we what we're going to accomplish in
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
interim study I mean do do we have
 
02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
actual areas that we actually want to
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
look into or is this just a polite way
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
of killing the bill because I just I
 
02:24:49.469 --> 02:24:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:52.750 --> 02:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
time Mr chair yes representative D
 
02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
Loreno I happen to agree with
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative cutab she did put in a a
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
human's work on this bill and um I can't
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
see how we can go forward um at this
 
02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
point Thank you so I'm I would say no on
 
02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:09.230 align:start position:0%
point Thank you so I'm I would say no on
interim

02:25:09.230 --> 02:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
interim
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
study I mean I think if there's if
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
there's actual work that people want to
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
do happy to work with them on it but I
 
02:25:18.150 --> 02:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
mean that could be done now there
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be an interim study for
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
it I just think it's a waste of
 
02:25:24.990 --> 02:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's time that's all well I guess
 
02:25:27.990 --> 02:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm oh I'm sorry yes representative
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
Perez see I think um putting in
 
02:25:34.910 --> 02:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
something about out of state and then
 
02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps getting rid of um multiple
 
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
requests to the same body um you know to
 
02:25:46.230 --> 02:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
the same for 30 um that's just an idea
 
02:25:48.990 --> 02:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
um my concern not concerned but being
 
02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
aware of the fact
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
that it's this bill is going to go to
 
02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
the Senate I don't know if we're beating
 
02:25:58.190 --> 02:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
our head against the wall or not because
 
02:26:01.950 --> 02:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
um you know I mean the senator from
 
02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
londondary I understand is going to put
 
02:26:06.750 --> 02:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
it before the Senate so I don't know if
 
02:26:08.590 --> 02:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
we'd be beating our head against the
 
02:26:14.790 --> 02:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:19.389 --> 02:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
know yeah I guess I'm um you just a
 
02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
brief comment in terms of The Residency
 
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
thing I I don't I mean obviously I
 
02:26:27.510 --> 02:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
haven't researched this but I I would
 
02:26:29.790 --> 02:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
think that there might be at least a
 
02:26:33.030 --> 02:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not you
 
02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
could um you could limit that to
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
requests for only people in the state
 
02:26:42.429 --> 02:26:42.439 align:start position:0%
and words what
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
um if you're if if records are open to
 
02:26:49.309 --> 02:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state what's the
 
02:26:51.429 --> 02:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
rationale for saying that they're not
 
02:26:53.389 --> 02:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
open to somebody out of the state I I
 
02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
don't know I mean maybe there's an
 
02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
argument for it but I it it it's not
 
02:27:00.309 --> 02:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me that that would be
 
02:27:02.309 --> 02:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
that would that would be proper but any
 
02:27:04.910 --> 02:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
at any rate I guess what I would say is
 
02:27:07.070 --> 02:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
um I think I agree with representative
 
02:27:10.269 --> 02:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
cutab I I will oppose interim study if
 
02:27:12.510 --> 02:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
the next I assume and if that fails I
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
assume that the that there would be a
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
motion of itl candidly although
 
02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
very much support the
 
02:27:22.230 --> 02:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
bill you know I interim study does not
 
02:27:25.230 --> 02:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
seem to me to make sense and so if that
 
02:27:28.030 --> 02:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
if I would suggest I'm going to vote
 
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
against interim study and then that I
 
02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
assume that there would then be a motion
 
02:27:34.190 --> 02:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
of itl Representative Kenny I've heard
 
02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
from so many people that we agree that
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
this is a complex issue so calling inim
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
study to continue to look into it with
 
02:27:42.750 --> 02:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders is absolutely not a waste
 
02:27:44.910 --> 02:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
of time and I am coming from a place of
 
02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
good faith I'm not just trying to kill
 
02:27:47.910 --> 02:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
the bill I don't believe the
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are you know I I think at
 
02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
one point yeah I was itl I think other
 
02:27:55.349 --> 02:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
people would have preferred it um to die
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
but at this point we had an amendment
 
02:28:00.269 --> 02:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
that the that some of the stakeholders
 
02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
who have been very vocal liked but the
 
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
committee did not then today we had an
 
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that maybe more the committee
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
liked it more but stakeholders pointed
 
02:28:10.190 --> 02:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
out things that we should look at and
 
02:28:12.750 --> 02:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
consider when so many states have these
 
02:28:15.309 --> 02:28:15.319 align:start position:0%
laws I understand one representative on
 
02:28:17.469 --> 02:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
the committee has looked into it
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
but inm study gives us more time to
 
02:28:21.349 --> 02:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
really dissect those laws decide what
 
02:28:23.550 --> 02:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
could work here what couldn't I just
 
02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
feel like if we weren't up against the
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
clock we would we would have continued
 
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
to work on this amendment with
 
02:28:31.349 --> 02:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholders with committee me members
 
02:28:34.389 --> 02:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
and try to get it to a I don't want itl
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
I won't support itl either I really
 
02:28:38.590 --> 02:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
think a good faith effort to bring
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
everyone to the table work on language
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
um see if we can counteract bad faith
 
02:28:47.110 --> 02:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
requests cuz they are out there but yet
 
02:28:50.269 --> 02:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
offer the Protections in language that I
 
02:28:52.269 --> 02:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
think a conversation is Justified in
 
02:28:54.670 --> 02:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
continuing to look at it um so I don't
 
02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
want to kill this bill I won't support
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
itl either and I really urge everybody
 
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
to allow the committee to work on this
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kab I mean I
 
02:29:06.790 --> 02:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
guess if there's work that needs to be
 
02:29:09.550 --> 02:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
done why couldn't we just get together
 
02:29:11.349 --> 02:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
and do it now I mean that the bill isn't
 
02:29:13.030 --> 02:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
isn't due out of committee so if people
 
02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
want to come together and work on this
 
02:29:16.349 --> 02:29:16.359 align:start position:0%
we can work together at now we can do it
 
02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
we can do another work session on it if
 
02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
people really genuinely want to in good
 
02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
faith work on this um we could recess
 
02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
this session and and work together in
 
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
good faith if if there's people that
 
02:29:29.710 --> 02:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
truly want to come forward and come
 
02:29:31.070 --> 02:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
together and do
 
02:29:33.269 --> 02:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
that the only thing I say about that is
 
02:29:34.469 --> 02:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
remember I mean if you're if you're
 
02:29:35.830 --> 02:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
going to do that and that might make
 
02:29:37.389 --> 02:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
sense you're going to need to do that
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
between now and next week because next
 
02:29:41.429 --> 02:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
week will be the last that's that's
 
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
going to be our last uh time for an
 
02:29:47.870 --> 02:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
executive session so here people
 
02:29:49.830 --> 02:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny I again feel like
 
02:29:51.950 --> 02:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
one week we could be in the situation
 
02:29:54.670 --> 02:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
where we are rushed we're not all at yes
 
02:29:57.150 --> 02:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
yet and I I just there's been a little
 
02:29:58.990 --> 02:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
bit of a Vibe of rushing not just on
 
02:30:01.150 --> 02:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and I I just don't think
 
02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
especially with complex issues such as
 
02:30:06.349 --> 02:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
91a that it's unjustified to kind of
 
02:30:08.950 --> 02:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
pump the breakes um and again I I wanted
 
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
to do otpa but hearing the concerns of
 
02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
committee members there is things to
 
02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
look at and if we had more than one week
 
02:30:17.309 --> 02:30:17.319 align:start position:0%
I would have supported what
 
02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative kutab just suggested but
 
02:30:21.150 --> 02:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
knowing that it's only one week I think
 
02:30:24.070 --> 02:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
inim study is the way to
 
02:30:27.309 --> 02:30:27.319 align:start position:0%
go all right anyone else um
 
02:30:30.349 --> 02:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
representative Andrew thank you Mr chair
 
02:30:33.389 --> 02:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
I concur with my colleague I'm not
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
trying to kill this bill just for the
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
sake of killing it but there are just so
 
02:30:41.389 --> 02:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
many stakeholders out there and then I I
 
02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
have to stop and thank number one the
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire
 
02:30:50.429 --> 02:30:50.439 align:start position:0%
and where we are right now everything's
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
not balanced the stakeholders they're
 
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
not all happy some I some I and I think
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
inim study for me is the way to go and
 
02:31:02.110 --> 02:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to be on the committee
 
02:31:05.469 --> 02:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
because I think we can see if we can't
 
02:31:07.710 --> 02:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
improve everything and I don't see the
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
hurry of pushing this bill through I I
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
just don't I mean I think we have plenty
 
02:31:15.750 --> 02:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
of time to see if we can't do better and
 
02:31:18.269 --> 02:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
I know Kate has done a great job but I
 
02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
think we need to do more thank you all
 
02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
right representative Perez I have been
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
asking since day one to put
 
02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
in residents of the town or business
 
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
owners in the town do not fall under
 
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
this and the argument is well if you
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
live in town and I don't I can just have
 
02:31:41.269 --> 02:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
you put it
 
02:31:46.990 --> 02:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
in I still think residents need to know
 
02:31:49.790 --> 02:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
that they are protected because
 
02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
residents are the ones who are putting
 
02:31:56.750 --> 02:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
in 91a perhaps most of the time I don't
 
02:32:00.510 --> 02:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
know so representative orgon if you have
 
02:32:02.349 --> 02:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
something new to add please well about
 
02:32:05.309 --> 02:32:05.319 align:start position:0%
limiting the residents these issues
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
often these isses often like affect
 
02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
people out of the town if it's a town
 
02:32:12.269 --> 02:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
issue or out of the state so I'm not
 
02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
sure whether it be fair or
 
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional wise to just limit the
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
resid especially and also like I know
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
journalists investigative journalists
 
02:32:23.389 --> 02:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
are concerned about this and frankly
 
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
which is kind of unfortunate
 
02:32:28.030 --> 02:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
situation the entities which do
 
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
investigative journalism events in New
 
02:32:31.710 --> 02:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are quite often not based in
 
02:32:34.830 --> 02:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire simply because of uh
 
02:32:36.349 --> 02:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
simply because of the condition of what
 
02:32:38.750 --> 02:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
the local media Outlets are versus those
 
02:32:41.710 --> 02:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
you know Nation Regional or Nationwide
 
02:32:44.429 --> 02:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
so that's probably side of kind of a
 
02:32:45.910 --> 02:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
side issue but it's been coming up you
 
02:32:47.790 --> 02:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
know I don't think living at to
 
02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
Residents would necessarily be a wise
 
02:32:51.469 --> 02:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
idea but is something that could be
 
02:32:53.630 --> 02:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
discussed um possibly in the interim
 
02:32:56.710 --> 02:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
study process if it comes to that thanks
 
02:32:59.030 --> 02:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Khan thank you Mr
 
02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
chairman I just my last word uh although
 
02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
I mentioned about the interm study but
 
02:33:08.590 --> 02:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
after hearing everybody's comment and
 
02:33:12.830 --> 02:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
the subject is a very uh U intense
 
02:33:17.230 --> 02:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
subject uh um and also you mentioned at
 
02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
the last bill that we have to make a
 
02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
draw a line I think the bill the bill
 
02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be a bit passage and I think we
 
02:33:28.389 --> 02:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
explore everything and I think we should
 
02:33:30.990 --> 02:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
go forward with the bill right right
 
02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
well the motion the motion right now
 
02:33:34.469 --> 02:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
that's been made and seconded is for
 
02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
interim study so um representative
 
02:33:41.349 --> 02:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
Stapleton yeah thank you Mr chair um
 
02:33:44.269 --> 02:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
relative I recall to we had testimony
 
02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
from a gentleman who res resided in
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
Maine but had some typee of business
 
02:33:51.389 --> 02:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
insance Over The Line in New Hampshire
 
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
and he was denied in rtk because he
 
02:33:57.790 --> 02:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't a resident um and I think the um
 
02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment takes care of that by opening
 
02:34:03.630 --> 02:34:03.640 align:start position:0%
up uh not restricting to well right you
 
02:34:05.710 --> 02:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
know what I should say what I should say
 
02:34:09.590 --> 02:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
on that is remember we have the H we
 
02:34:11.830 --> 02:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
recommended and it went and it was
 
02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
passed by the house I think La either
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
last session or the or the week before
 
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
a bill that removed the citizen language
 
02:34:23.349 --> 02:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
in two sections of the I of the uh of
 
02:34:26.230 --> 02:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
the right to no law and change replaced
 
02:34:30.429 --> 02:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
citizen with person so we've and one for
 
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
one of those I mean among other things
 
02:34:34.790 --> 02:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
for that very reason the idea that you
 
02:34:37.790 --> 02:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
know the city of Rochester could say
 
02:34:40.269 --> 02:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not allowing the
 
02:34:42.510 --> 02:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
publisher of the newspaper that serves
 
02:34:44.910 --> 02:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
Rochester to get access to records
 
02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
because he lives in Maine
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me to be just you

Judiciary Committee back uh to order um
 
03:23:10.790 --> 03:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
the next bill we have on the schedule is
 
03:23:13.550 --> 03:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 108 2 um that's the one
 
03:23:16.349 --> 03:23:16.359 align:start position:0%
that we formed a subcommittee and I um
 
03:23:18.150 --> 03:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
we had a meeting of the subcommittee
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
yesterday um and I'm my I believe we
 
03:23:22.990 --> 03:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
made some progress I'm just going to ask
 
03:23:25.269 --> 03:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
represent tur I I think we're not
 
03:23:26.790 --> 03:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
prepared to vote on this today but I'm
 
03:23:28.349 --> 03:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
going to just ask representative tur
 
03:23:31.910 --> 03:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
maybe to give us a bit of an update yeah
 
03:23:34.389 --> 03:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
thanks uh quickly though
 
03:23:37.950 --> 03:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
yeah the so you correct we we are hoping
 
03:23:41.070 --> 03:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
to to not take this up today we uh
 
03:23:41.080 --> 03:23:42.229 align:start position:0%
to to not take this up today we uh
collectively

03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
collectively
 
03:23:44.389 --> 03:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
put together some language that I think
 
03:23:46.990 --> 03:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
addresses the concerns that sort of were
 
03:23:49.990 --> 03:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
raised to um cause us to pause a little
 
03:23:52.389 --> 03:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
bit on that bill and hopefully clarify
 
03:23:54.550 --> 03:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
the the intent of it so the the goal is
 
03:23:58.189 --> 03:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
to get that uh Amendment drafted and in
 
03:23:59.950 --> 03:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
front of a couple of people who
 
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
externally uh had had weighed in on on
 
03:24:06.150 --> 03:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
on the proposal so that we can basically
 
03:24:10.590 --> 03:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
move it next week sure all right yeah no
 
03:24:10.600 --> 03:24:16.429 align:start position:0%
move it next week sure all right yeah no
that's

03:24:16.429 --> 03:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:18.510 --> 03:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah no no no we we'll get that out
 
03:24:21.030 --> 03:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
so you know just just a sort of a a
 
03:24:24.189 --> 03:24:24.199 align:start position:0%
scheduling note my an my anticipation
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I hope I'm not being overly
 
03:24:28.269 --> 03:24:28.279 align:start position:0%
optimistic is that we will get through
 
03:24:30.870 --> 03:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
all of the bills except for the one we
 
03:24:34.349 --> 03:24:34.359 align:start position:0%
just discussed 1082 and 1432 which is
 
03:24:35.830 --> 03:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
the AI bill which we're going to have a
 
03:24:37.389 --> 03:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
discussion on but not vote on for
 
03:24:39.830 --> 03:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
reasons I'll talk about in a minute um
 
03:24:41.229 --> 03:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
or I'm talk I'll talk about it later I
 
03:24:42.349 --> 03:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
should say
 
03:24:46.110 --> 03:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
um uh so my hope is that next Wednesday
 
03:24:49.150 --> 03:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
we only have two bills remaining to exec
 
03:24:51.950 --> 03:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
and what I'd like to do I know we I know
 
03:24:54.670 --> 03:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
that uh Some people prefer to start at
 
03:24:56.429 --> 03:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
10: and that's why I've been doing that
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
recently but one of our Representatives
 
03:25:00.950 --> 03:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
has a particular reason to be out of
 
03:25:03.790 --> 03:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
here early uh next Wednesday so I'd like
 
03:25:06.110 --> 03:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
to start next Wednesday at 9 o' we only
 
03:25:08.110 --> 03:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
have two bills hopefully we can get
 
03:25:10.110 --> 03:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
through them relatively quickly and and
 
03:25:12.870 --> 03:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
get out I believe doe two weeks ago that
 
03:25:14.750 --> 03:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
I had to be out of here by five are we
 
03:25:16.469 --> 03:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
going to be out by five oh no no no
 
03:25:17.630 --> 03:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to be out actually we're
 
03:25:25.269 --> 03:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:29.389 --> 03:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
um forget that we're starting at 10: um
 
03:25:31.269 --> 03:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
I because I we we've made another
 
03:25:33.070 --> 03:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
commitment I forgot about that we made
 
03:25:35.830 --> 03:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
another commitment at nine o'clock so um
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll figure we'll we'll figure
 
03:25:40.630 --> 03:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
something out all right so let's go on
 
03:25:45.070 --> 03:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
then to uh um House Bill 11:15 and I'm
 
03:25:46.910 --> 03:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
going to recognize myself I make a
 
03:25:49.870 --> 03:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass um is there
 
03:25:51.870 --> 03:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
second second right and I like to I'm
 
03:25:53.710 --> 03:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
going to speak to this very briefly
 
03:25:56.590 --> 03:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
we've this is the one the bill about
 
03:25:58.429 --> 03:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
terminating the tenancy when the lease
 
03:26:01.030 --> 03:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
is over I think I have an idea what the
 
03:26:03.309 --> 03:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
vote is likely to be on this this is a
 
03:26:06.550 --> 03:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
bill we passed last year uh was killed
 
03:26:09.950 --> 03:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
in the Senate uh We've I I don't want to
 
03:26:13.269 --> 03:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
belabor it I feel that it's leases
 
03:26:15.150 --> 03:26:15.160 align:start position:0%
should mean what they say and that
 
03:26:17.670 --> 03:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
they're um that the Supreme Court
 
03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
decision from 2005 whenever it was um
 
03:26:24.389 --> 03:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
which basically says that the tenant can
 
03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
continue to stay there forever um
 
03:26:28.910 --> 03:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense and should be
 
03:26:31.590 --> 03:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
overruled and I hope that you'll support
 
03:26:34.429 --> 03:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
it that's all I have to
 
03:26:37.550 --> 03:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
say reprentative Kenny uh thank you Mr
 
03:26:41.389 --> 03:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
chairman um so yeah I I through test
 
03:26:43.750 --> 03:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
testimony this time around last time um
 
03:26:46.670 --> 03:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
I I want to begin by addressing the idea
 
03:26:49.349 --> 03:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
that this is just a simple contract um
 
03:26:51.950 --> 03:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a 3L in law school but in 1l you
 
03:26:54.429 --> 03:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
take contracts and um one of the first
 
03:26:56.550 --> 03:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
things you learn that in contract law it
 
03:26:59.070 --> 03:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
assumes that the parties have roughly
 
03:27:02.309 --> 03:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
equaling uh equal bargaining power and
 
03:27:04.550 --> 03:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
I've been a renter for quite a long time
 
03:27:07.309 --> 03:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
at this point um and to act like there's
 
03:27:10.469 --> 03:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
equal bargaining power just isn't true
 
03:27:13.429 --> 03:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
um the dynamic is just not equal the
 
03:27:15.990 --> 03:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
landlord sets the terms and the Tenant
 
03:27:18.469 --> 03:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh takes it or leaves it and with a
 
03:27:22.229 --> 03:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
historically low rental vacancy of uh
 
03:27:25.830 --> 03:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
0.6% what are tenants likely to do take
 
03:27:26.950 --> 03:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
what they are offered without the
 
03:27:29.070 --> 03:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
bargaining power because if they say no
 
03:27:31.229 --> 03:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
the numbers don't lie it's going to be
 
03:27:32.670 --> 03:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to find another option I've
 
03:27:32.680 --> 03:27:33.510 align:start position:0%
difficult to find another option I've
been

03:27:33.510 --> 03:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:27:36.590 --> 03:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
there uh yet a landlord almost
 
03:27:38.110 --> 03:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
guaranteed again based on the numbers
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
will have prospective tenants uh lining
 
03:27:40.319 --> 03:27:42.030 align:start position:0%
will have prospective tenants uh lining
up

03:27:42.030 --> 03:27:42.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:27:43.670 --> 03:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
so it's it's important to note that at
 
03:27:46.269 --> 03:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
the end of a lease um term landlords are
 
03:27:49.070 --> 03:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
not left without any options regarding
 
03:27:51.469 --> 03:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
uh to agreements they can change lease
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
terms increase rent decide that they are
 
03:27:56.030 --> 03:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
no longer wanting to rent the property
 
03:27:57.630 --> 03:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
decide to rent a property to family
 
03:27:59.630 --> 03:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
members they can move into the property
 
03:27:59.640 --> 03:28:00.469 align:start position:0%
members they can move into the property
um

03:28:00.469 --> 03:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:02.910 --> 03:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
Etc the only thing that they can't do
 
03:28:05.670 --> 03:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
right now is refuse to continue renting
 
03:28:07.950 --> 03:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
to the current tenant without giving a
 
03:28:10.630 --> 03:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason conversely the only
 
03:28:12.030 --> 03:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
thing a tenant can do at the end of a
 
03:28:13.630 --> 03:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
lease term is decide whether they want
 
03:28:16.150 --> 03:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
to stay and accept the new lease terms
 
03:28:18.429 --> 03:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
imposed by their landlords or try to
 
03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
find another place to live which is um
 
03:28:24.429 --> 03:28:24.439 align:start position:0%
very very very hard that is why yes
 
03:28:27.389 --> 03:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
tenants need protection that's why for
 
03:28:30.429 --> 03:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
the past 39 years tenants have been
 
03:28:33.269 --> 03:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
protected from arbitrarily being
 
03:28:35.750 --> 03:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
evicted because we are talking about an
 
03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
individual's stability a roof over their
 
03:28:40.189 --> 03:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
head it's a
 
03:28:43.830 --> 03:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
necessity and unfortunately any eviction
 
03:28:46.229 --> 03:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
in this housing market is highly likely
 
03:28:49.389 --> 03:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
to result in some period of homelessness
 
03:28:51.670 --> 03:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
homelessness is not something a person
 
03:28:54.150 --> 03:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
should be subject to simply because
 
03:28:56.309 --> 03:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
their landlord would prefer to rent to a
 
03:28:59.630 --> 03:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
different tenant yet homelessness grew
 
03:29:03.550 --> 03:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
55% between 2022 and 2023 and that is
 
03:29:05.790 --> 03:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
the highest growth
 
03:29:07.910 --> 03:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and for the reasons I already
 
03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
stated this bill would make this already
 
03:29:13.550 --> 03:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
dire issue much much
 
03:29:15.870 --> 03:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
worse I shouldn't have to State it but
 
03:29:18.229 --> 03:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
it is a horrible issue uh that if people
 
03:29:20.269 --> 03:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
get evicted it can disrupt children's
 
03:29:21.990 --> 03:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
education it can make employment
 
03:29:25.150 --> 03:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
struggles for the adults among a host of
 
03:29:25.160 --> 03:29:26.030 align:start position:0%
struggles for the adults among a host of
other

03:29:26.030 --> 03:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:29:26.040 --> 03:29:27.910 align:start position:0%
other
issues

03:29:27.910 --> 03:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:29:31.349 --> 03:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
um so to sum it up I I don't think that
 
03:29:33.750 --> 03:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
it should be easy to take away someone's
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
home uh and that's what we have right
 
03:29:39.630 --> 03:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
now we we require cause good cause
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
strikes a balance between protect in the
 
03:29:42.990 --> 03:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
property rights of landlords while
 
03:29:45.790 --> 03:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
offering some stability to tenants and
 
03:29:47.630 --> 03:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
that's how it should remain I think the
 
03:29:49.950 --> 03:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court got that right thank you
 
03:29:52.429 --> 03:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman all right any other yes
 
03:29:52.439 --> 03:29:53.630 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman all right any other yes
representative

03:29:53.630 --> 03:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:29:57.550 --> 03:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
gon thank you Mr chair for our young
 
03:30:00.590 --> 03:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
colleague who's rented for a long time
 
03:30:02.229 --> 03:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
things don't change a whole lot when you
 
03:30:05.429 --> 03:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
buy because I'm not in a uh much of a
 
03:30:08.150 --> 03:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
equal negotiating partnership or
 
03:30:09.710 --> 03:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
relationship with the bank when I go to
 
03:30:12.070 --> 03:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
buy a house there much more powerful
 
03:30:14.269 --> 03:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
relationship than I am I'm subject to
 
03:30:16.389 --> 03:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
their terms and they just tell me if you
 
03:30:17.870 --> 03:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
don't like it go find someone else we
 
03:30:17.880 --> 03:30:18.950 align:start position:0%
don't like it go find someone else we
don't

03:30:18.950 --> 03:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:30:22.110 --> 03:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
care I'm not protected as as equally as
 
03:30:23.630 --> 03:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
the bank is so just to give you one
 
03:30:25.510 --> 03:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
example when I buy title insurance for
 
03:30:27.349 --> 03:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
the house it's not to protect the title
 
03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
for me is to protect the title for
 
03:30:33.229 --> 03:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
them I get to pay for it but they're the
 
03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
ones who get protected by it so life
 
03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
does not change when you go and you buy
 
03:30:39.990 --> 03:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
a house and if I don't make the house
 
03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
payments there there's a procedure
 
03:30:44.910 --> 03:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
called foreclosure and then if I am that
 
03:30:46.870 --> 03:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
process the end result of that process
 
03:30:51.469 --> 03:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
is I could be homeless so
 
03:30:54.389 --> 03:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
it's a contract is a
 
03:30:56.670 --> 03:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
contract and it either means something
 
03:30:59.910 --> 03:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
or it doesn't we either enforce it or it
 
03:31:02.189 --> 03:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't there's not a tenant on this
 
03:31:03.910 --> 03:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
planet who does not know when their
 
03:31:05.469 --> 03:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
lease is
 
03:31:08.590 --> 03:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
up and if you know your lease is coming
 
03:31:11.750 --> 03:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
up take it upon yourself be a big boy
 
03:31:14.229 --> 03:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
talk to your landlord and say hey I'd
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
like to renew my lease or I don't think
 
03:31:19.150 --> 03:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
I can stay here or whatever the case may
 
03:31:21.990 --> 03:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
be but take responsibility for yourself
 
03:31:23.750 --> 03:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
and do what you need to do and make
 
03:31:25.630 --> 03:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
those plans accordingly are there
 
03:31:27.790 --> 03:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous landlords yes are there
 
03:31:30.510 --> 03:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
dirt bag tenants yes the world is full
 
03:31:32.389 --> 03:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
of all kinds of examples of all kinds of
 
03:31:34.389 --> 03:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
behavior and there's no possible way
 
03:31:36.349 --> 03:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
that we can legislate all of that or to
 
03:31:39.670 --> 03:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
prevent any of that however a contract
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
is a contract and if if you're mature
 
03:31:43.389 --> 03:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
enough to sign it you're mature enough
 
03:31:44.710 --> 03:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
to live by its
 
03:31:48.030 --> 03:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
terms right other any other comments
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative stapled no thank you Mr
 
03:31:52.189 --> 03:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
chair you mentioned the Supreme Court I
 
03:31:55.150 --> 03:31:55.160 align:start position:0%
the state supreme court decision yes I I
 
03:31:57.750 --> 03:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize it was long before I
 
03:32:00.189 --> 03:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
was a member of that court because I was
 
03:32:03.189 --> 03:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
going to also ask what what the basis
 
03:32:06.790 --> 03:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
was uh that they they said you could
 
03:32:10.150 --> 03:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
stay after the term of lease the basis
 
03:32:12.950 --> 03:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
was I I sort of along the lines of what
 
03:32:14.469 --> 03:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny said it was sort of
 
03:32:19.469 --> 03:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
a pol a basic a policy issue of uh it
 
03:32:22.229 --> 03:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the fact that the contract
 
03:32:22.239 --> 03:32:23.269 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the fact that the contract
is

03:32:23.269 --> 03:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:32:26.110 --> 03:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
over um shouldn't be enough and I I
 
03:32:29.469 --> 03:32:29.479 align:start position:0%
think the if you read the decision it it
 
03:32:33.349 --> 03:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
essentially said that with respect to
 
03:32:35.349 --> 03:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
what's called restricted property and
 
03:32:37.790 --> 03:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
bear in mind that doesn't restricted
 
03:32:39.710 --> 03:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
property means if you're a landlord and
 
03:32:43.990 --> 03:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
and you own as as as small as a
 
03:32:46.590 --> 03:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
2unit rental property as long as you
 
03:32:48.990 --> 03:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
don't live in it if you rent if you have
 
03:32:51.269 --> 03:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
a you know a duplex that you don't live
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
in and you rent both of them out that
 
03:32:56.469 --> 03:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
constitutes restricted property the anal
 
03:32:59.550 --> 03:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
the analysis of the Court was well for
 
03:33:02.750 --> 03:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
for the landlord it's really an the
 
03:33:05.070 --> 03:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
landlord all the landlord really should
 
03:33:07.269 --> 03:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
be caring about is the economics of the
 
03:33:10.110 --> 03:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
situation it doesn't matter whether you
 
03:33:12.229 --> 03:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
know you have tenant X or tenant y it's
 
03:33:13.349 --> 03:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
just the the only thing you're
 
03:33:16.070 --> 03:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
interested in is is the economics of the
 
03:33:19.110 --> 03:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
situation which you
 
03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
know that's that's you make a contract
 
03:33:24.910 --> 03:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
that says somebody had that it's over in
 
03:33:28.189 --> 03:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
a year um it it seems to me that it
 
03:33:29.910 --> 03:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
ought to mean something but but that was
 
03:33:31.630 --> 03:33:31.640 align:start position:0%
the that was the anal it was sort of a
 
03:33:36.670 --> 03:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
public policy um don't uh it's not good
 
03:33:38.429 --> 03:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
enough that the term of of the lease are
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
over that's that was the argument yeah
 
03:33:43.790 --> 03:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
yeah excuse me thank you for that
 
03:33:47.309 --> 03:33:47.319 align:start position:0%
explanation I I I wanted to say that I I
 
03:33:49.389 --> 03:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Kenny on the
 
03:33:50.910 --> 03:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
points that he made I was going to make
 
03:33:53.469 --> 03:33:53.479 align:start position:0%
several like that but he's already done
 
03:33:56.950 --> 03:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
it um if anything the situation is worse
 
03:33:59.790 --> 03:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
now than that Supreme Court decision and
 
03:34:02.670 --> 03:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
for that reason I I know the law is the
 
03:34:04.670 --> 03:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
law and it logically makes sense what
 
03:34:06.389 --> 03:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
the bill says but under the
 
03:34:08.950 --> 03:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances putting people out and all
 
03:34:11.389 --> 03:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
of the impacts that will happen
 
03:34:13.510 --> 03:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
until the market is relieved or in
 
03:34:16.030 --> 03:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
better stead I I've got to go against
 
03:34:18.790 --> 03:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
the bill all right other comments Mr
 
03:34:20.750 --> 03:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
chair y representative D Loreno thank
 
03:34:24.790 --> 03:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I just want to say that um
 
03:34:27.070 --> 03:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
tenants aren't pieces on a on a on a
 
03:34:30.510 --> 03:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
chess board or a game board um when they
 
03:34:32.990 --> 03:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
sign a lease and move into an apartment
 
03:34:38.990 --> 03:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
they establish a home to give them one
 
03:34:42.429 --> 03:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
year with with a 30-day notice to leave
 
03:34:46.389 --> 03:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
for no legitimate reason except that the
 
03:34:49.030 --> 03:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
landlord wants the uh wants to put the
 
03:34:51.150 --> 03:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
apartment back on the market I don't I
 
03:34:53.550 --> 03:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
don't think that's good enough I think
 
03:34:56.189 --> 03:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
um we are in crisis here in New
 
03:34:58.349 --> 03:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um there was a huge housing
 
03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
shortage um and so I think it's a um
 
03:35:04.950 --> 03:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a
 
03:35:09.429 --> 03:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
human crisis a human needs crisis that
 
03:35:11.469 --> 03:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
we're facing
 
03:35:15.510 --> 03:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yes uh representative trip U
 
03:35:19.469 --> 03:35:19.479 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh I believe when we
 
03:35:22.630 --> 03:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
had when we heard the the bill I asked
 
03:35:27.030 --> 03:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
the question uh does the supreme court
 
03:35:30.309 --> 03:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
hearing also mandate that the terms of
 
03:35:33.309 --> 03:35:33.319 align:start position:0%
lease not change and I think the answer
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
there was no that's correct yes you
 
03:35:37.830 --> 03:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
could you can change the terms of the
 
03:35:39.870 --> 03:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
lease yes you can change you can change
 
03:35:43.830 --> 03:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
the terms so this is I I I find this
 
03:35:47.269 --> 03:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
this whole argument that uh you know the
 
03:35:52.110 --> 03:35:52.120 align:start position:0%
uh the uh tenants have uh
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
U rights to stay forever a little moot
 
03:35:59.870 --> 03:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
because uh if the landlord decides to
 
03:36:04.950 --> 03:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
raise the uh the rent and the uh uh
 
03:36:07.189 --> 03:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
tenant doesn't pay it then isn't that
 
03:36:11.030 --> 03:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
cause to uh remove them sure so it's uh
 
03:36:13.349 --> 03:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
like I said it's it's it's one of these
 
03:36:15.710 --> 03:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
things where much like representative
 
03:36:19.710 --> 03:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
gon said uh you know the tenant should
 
03:36:23.710 --> 03:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
know that their lease is ending and they
 
03:36:26.349 --> 03:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
should have take some action the action
 
03:36:28.150 --> 03:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
should be either to negotiate a new
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
lease or to find a new place to live now
 
03:36:34.389 --> 03:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
there's there's responsibility on both
 
03:36:37.469 --> 03:36:37.479 align:start position:0%
the landlord and the tenants part so
 
03:36:39.229 --> 03:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
that's uh one of the reasons I support
 
03:36:41.870 --> 03:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
the bill yeah you know just to say I I I
 
03:36:44.349 --> 03:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
think you rais a very valid point and I
 
03:36:47.389 --> 03:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
mean part of the thing that troubles me
 
03:36:49.189 --> 03:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
so much about that Supreme Court
 
03:36:49.199 --> 03:36:50.830 align:start position:0%
so much about that Supreme Court
decision

03:36:50.830 --> 03:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:36:54.269 --> 03:36:54.279 align:start position:0%
is it you're absolutely right if if you
 
03:36:58.870 --> 03:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
know this in terms of the um you know
 
03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in the housing
 
03:37:04.429 --> 03:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
market um I I I tend to think if
 
03:37:06.349 --> 03:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
anything it would be a positive but the
 
03:37:09.670 --> 03:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
the the problem I have is this decision
 
03:37:14.070 --> 03:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
encouraged is dishonesty by landlords
 
03:37:17.429 --> 03:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
because it if the if the landlord you
 
03:37:19.349 --> 03:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
know if the landlord just wants to get
 
03:37:22.469 --> 03:37:22.479 align:start position:0%
you out because the lease is over they
 
03:37:24.550 --> 03:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
can't do that because that that that
 
03:37:26.349 --> 03:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case says you can't do so
 
03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
what do they have to do they have to
 
03:37:29.229 --> 03:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
come up with another reason and they'll
 
03:37:31.550 --> 03:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
find another reason they'll say I'm
 
03:37:33.389 --> 03:37:33.399 align:start position:0%
going to raise the rent or I want to
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
have my brother-in-law move into the
 
03:37:39.349 --> 03:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
apartment or um and and you know but why
 
03:37:42.870 --> 03:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
do we want to to encourage the law to do
 
03:37:44.830 --> 03:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
that why why isn't it enough to say we
 
03:37:47.670 --> 03:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
had a year a lease for a year and now
 
03:37:50.630 --> 03:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
the year's over and that's so that's
 
03:37:52.710 --> 03:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
that again I I don't want to belabor it
 
03:37:53.990 --> 03:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
but that that's one of the things that
 
03:37:57.189 --> 03:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
bothers me about other uh
 
03:37:59.790 --> 03:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
other anyone else wish to speak all
 
03:38:02.189 --> 03:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
right then I think we're ready for uh oh
 
03:38:04.950 --> 03:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry represented me thank you Mr
 
03:38:08.030 --> 03:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
chair um I just want to address the I I
 
03:38:10.630 --> 03:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
would like to say that I I agree um
 
03:38:13.870 --> 03:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
fully with representative Kenny and um I
 
03:38:15.910 --> 03:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
think the very idea that a contract is
 
03:38:18.630 --> 03:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
just a contract as in this stack of
 
03:38:22.349 --> 03:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
paper um is governed by just the words
 
03:38:26.110 --> 03:38:26.120 align:start position:0%
that are in it is not right there are
 
03:38:27.469 --> 03:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
plenty of business contracts that are
 
03:38:31.750 --> 03:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
governed by by statutes and I think this
 
03:38:34.830 --> 03:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
is and and those are set by policy so I
 
03:38:37.590 --> 03:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
think this is one case where the policy
 
03:38:40.349 --> 03:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
for housing um dictates that we should
 
03:38:43.309 --> 03:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
itl this thank you all right anyone else
 
03:38:43.319 --> 03:38:44.950 align:start position:0%
itl this thank you all right anyone else
representative

03:38:44.950 --> 03:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:38:48.429 --> 03:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
Stapleton yeah the the drop dead term
 
03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
date um this this is a home a residence
 
03:38:55.070 --> 03:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
not a hotel room hotel room or
 
03:38:57.750 --> 03:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
short-term stay I I can understand that
 
03:39:00.469 --> 03:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
but when someone moves in with family
 
03:39:02.389 --> 03:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
and establishes
 
03:39:04.630 --> 03:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
residents uh and they just to cut them
 
03:39:07.950 --> 03:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
off at the end of term um just seems raw
 
03:39:10.510 --> 03:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
and hard and and contrary to what we
 
03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
need in the state today uh you know
 
03:39:14.830 --> 03:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
there's Provisions for tenants at will
 
03:39:17.870 --> 03:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
and some contracts have those in if uh
 
03:39:21.429 --> 03:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
the lease is not renewed um and you and
 
03:39:23.630 --> 03:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
landlord permits you to stay uh you're
 
03:39:27.110 --> 03:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
tenant at will until such time that that
 
03:39:32.070 --> 03:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
tency is challenged or revoked
 
03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
um I I don't understand why um there's
 
03:39:42.150 --> 03:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
so many ways to um provide some leeway
 
03:39:45.030 --> 03:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
here uh if you want to eventually remove
 
03:39:46.950 --> 03:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
the tenant because you're going to
 
03:39:50.469 --> 03:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate the place sell the place uh
 
03:39:53.550 --> 03:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
have other tenants increase in rates all
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
of those seem to be like legitimate
 
03:39:59.510 --> 03:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
reasons um and I just don't understand
 
03:40:01.150 --> 03:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
the abrupt
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
termination you know you're done get out
 
03:40:07.389 --> 03:40:07.399 align:start position:0%
and it it makes no sense to me basically
 
03:40:09.469 --> 03:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
all right other comments representative
 
03:40:13.030 --> 03:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
Perez so once my lease is up and I can
 
03:40:17.070 --> 03:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
rent month to month I have full control
 
03:40:19.550 --> 03:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
so the renter now has full control they
 
03:40:21.710 --> 03:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
can give 30 days notice and say I'm out
 
03:40:21.720 --> 03:40:22.710 align:start position:0%
can give 30 days notice and say I'm out
of

03:40:22.710 --> 03:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:40:26.030 --> 03:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
here so we're giving full control to the
 
03:40:29.550 --> 03:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
renter but I own the home I own the the
 
03:40:32.750 --> 03:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
the place where's my control um my son
 
03:40:34.510 --> 03:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
who lives in North Carolina was in an
 
03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
apartment and he had a a a lease the
 
03:40:40.950 --> 03:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
woman above her just had um a bird
 
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
feeder which wasn't allowed and he
 
03:40:46.510 --> 03:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
complained that the the um squirrels
 
03:40:49.349 --> 03:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
were all over his thing because of that
 
03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
well they told him he couldn't renew his
 
03:40:53.590 --> 03:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
lease because of that so because he
 
03:40:53.600 --> 03:40:55.429 align:start position:0%
lease because of that so because he
complained

03:40:55.429 --> 03:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
complained
 
03:40:58.070 --> 03:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
so it's got to be fair you can't have
 
03:41:01.469 --> 03:41:01.479 align:start position:0%
the tenant have all the say and not the
 
03:41:06.750 --> 03:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
home the owner owner of the property so
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%

03:44:15.149 --> 03:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
20249 78h and I'm going to pass out a
 
03:44:17.269 --> 03:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
copy I did email it to everybody kind of
 
03:44:19.670 --> 03:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
late last night so I'm not sure if
 
03:44:31.630 --> 03:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:38.760 --> 03:45:08.670 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:19.830 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:45:19.830 --> 03:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:22.070 --> 03:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
are you missing I did I not I think I
 
03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
may have so everybody got copy of the
 
03:45:27.590 --> 03:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
amend you do okay I thought I'd ask I
 
03:45:30.469 --> 03:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
neglected to pass out all
 
03:45:35.070 --> 03:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:40.349 --> 03:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
Kat so I did talk with um
 
03:45:42.790 --> 03:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
the representative from the Nea to try
 
03:45:44.830 --> 03:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
and address several of the concerns that
 
03:45:47.269 --> 03:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
were mentioned during the hearing and so
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's what this amendment is seeking to
 
03:45:52.070 --> 03:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
do um
 
03:45:52.080 --> 03:45:53.590 align:start position:0%
do um
particularly

03:45:53.590 --> 03:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
03:45:53.600 --> 03:45:57.870 align:start position:0%
particularly
um

03:45:57.870 --> 03:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:02.070 --> 03:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
on line on page two on line five you
 
03:46:04.229 --> 03:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
will see that subpoenas shall be issued
 
03:46:06.510 --> 03:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
by hearing officers appointed by the
 
03:46:09.309 --> 03:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to hear code of
 
03:46:11.630 --> 03:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
conduct violation uh hearings in
 
03:46:13.630 --> 03:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
accordance with the following conditions
 
03:46:18.309 --> 03:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of uh concern about the
 
03:46:20.710 --> 03:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education making these
 
03:46:22.950 --> 03:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
decisions and so now we've made it an
 
03:46:24.750 --> 03:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
impartial hearing
 
03:46:27.870 --> 03:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
officer there was also concern about
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
this being kind of a one-way street
 
03:46:33.910 --> 03:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
where the department
 
03:46:36.790 --> 03:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
could issue these but then if if a
 
03:46:40.670 --> 03:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
teacher or other licensed educator
 
03:46:42.309 --> 03:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
potentially could obtain data that could
 
03:46:43.630 --> 03:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
exonerate them that they wouldn't have
 
03:46:45.189 --> 03:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
the opportunity and so I went ahead and
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
added in that opportunity also on page
 
03:46:49.590 --> 03:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
two lines 22 to
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
26 in any adjudicatory proceeding
 
03:46:53.790 --> 03:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
resulting from a code of conduct
 
03:46:55.990 --> 03:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
violation a hearing officer shall also
 
03:46:58.189 --> 03:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
issues subpoenas on behalf of a
 
03:47:00.149 --> 03:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
certified educator at their request as
 
03:47:02.469 --> 03:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
relevant to a code of conduct
 
03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
violation um and
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
so um another thing that was brought up
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
was um
 
03:47:10.080 --> 03:47:11.630 align:start position:0%
was um
relative

03:47:11.630 --> 03:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
relative
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
to the use of restraint and seclusion
 
03:47:18.870 --> 03:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
and RSA 126 U Already covers that and
 
03:47:20.469 --> 03:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
it's not in the code of conduct so we
 
03:47:23.510 --> 03:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
did go ahead and remove it from here
 
03:47:25.910 --> 03:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
another issue that was brought up was
 
03:47:27.070 --> 03:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
there was
 
03:47:33.149 --> 03:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
concern that um one of the topics was a
 
03:47:36.910 --> 03:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
little bit um Broad and that's on page
 
03:47:40.510 --> 03:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
one lines 26 through 27 we went ahead
 
03:47:42.229 --> 03:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
and made it very clear that it was any
 
03:47:44.550 --> 03:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
alleged failure to provide appropriate
 
03:47:46.349 --> 03:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
supervision pursuant to Local School
 
03:47:48.910 --> 03:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
District policy by a licensed educator
 
03:47:51.670 --> 03:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
which resulted in harm or potential
 
03:47:53.870 --> 03:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
physical harm we wanted to make it
 
03:47:55.469 --> 03:47:55.479 align:start position:0%
really clear that this isn't talking
 
03:47:56.630 --> 03:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
about you
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
know a poster on the wall I think was
 
03:48:01.110 --> 03:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
the example that we were given and so
 
03:48:04.550 --> 03:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
this is you know know a child was had
 
03:48:06.750 --> 03:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
something bad happen to them so we've
 
03:48:08.550 --> 03:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
gone ahead and put in all these things
 
03:48:10.469 --> 03:48:10.479 align:start position:0%
and I believe let me just double check
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
my notes that I didn't miss any of the
 
03:48:16.110 --> 03:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
changes but I believe that that
 
03:48:20.750 --> 03:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:23.469 --> 03:48:23.479 align:start position:0%
majority of the
 
03:48:27.229 --> 03:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
concerns let me just see oh and then the
 
03:48:27.239 --> 03:48:29.229 align:start position:0%
concerns let me just see oh and then the
other

03:48:29.229 --> 03:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:48:31.550 --> 03:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
thing that was mentioned was to make
 
03:48:33.469 --> 03:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
sure that the subpoena was relevant to a
 
03:48:36.030 --> 03:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
coda conduct violation and that was also
 
03:48:40.189 --> 03:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
addressed in here um onl page two line
 
03:48:44.590 --> 03:48:44.600 align:start position:0%
six um so um and the last thing was in
 
03:48:48.030 --> 03:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
here was that um on page two lines 34
 
03:48:50.910 --> 03:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
and 35 any evidence collected pursuant
 
03:48:52.510 --> 03:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
to The subpoena shall be made available
 
03:48:54.550 --> 03:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
to both parties and any adjudicatory
 
03:48:56.950 --> 03:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
proceedings resulting there from so that
 
03:49:00.149 --> 03:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
both parties would get to to review
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
whatever is is collected um so I think
 
03:49:03.840 --> 03:49:04.710 align:start position:0%
whatever is is collected um so I think
we've

03:49:04.710 --> 03:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
we've
 
03:49:08.950 --> 03:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
covered much of the concern I know that
 
03:49:11.870 --> 03:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
we did hear testimony that a lot of the
 
03:49:14.149 --> 03:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
data that has been needed has been
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
granted from school districts however in
 
03:49:19.189 --> 03:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
the howy long case for example it was
 
03:49:20.630 --> 03:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
not they got to review it but they
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
didn't get to take a copy and I think
 
03:49:24.950 --> 03:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's a very serious thing I think you
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
know we're talking about the safety of
 
03:49:29.590 --> 03:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
children here and we shouldn't wait
 
03:49:32.030 --> 03:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
until a new employee comes along to the
 
03:49:33.790 --> 03:49:33.800 align:start position:0%
doe and doesn't have such a great
 
03:49:35.590 --> 03:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
relationship and suddenly can't get the
 
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
data that we need and potentially we're
 
03:49:39.389 --> 03:49:39.399 align:start position:0%
putting the safety of Children at Risk
 
03:49:41.469 --> 03:49:41.479 align:start position:0%
especially when we've tailored this to
 
03:49:43.590 --> 03:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
make it very clear that we're not this
 
03:49:45.550 --> 03:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
is not meant to be a fishing Expedition
 
03:49:47.590 --> 03:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
this is just meant to be if there are
 
03:49:50.990 --> 03:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
very serious potential issues with with
 
03:49:53.309 --> 03:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
children and the majority of teachers
 
03:49:56.030 --> 03:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
are all wonderful my children have had
 
03:49:58.110 --> 03:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
great teachers but we did hear concerns
 
03:50:01.349 --> 03:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
that attent you know occasionally there
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
are bad apples Bad actors and and we
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we're keeping
 
03:50:07.070 --> 03:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
Kids Safe
 
03:50:08.950 --> 03:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
And I think that this is a very
 
03:50:12.389 --> 03:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
important important uh bill for that
 
03:50:16.510 --> 03:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
reason and I hope that this amendment
 
03:50:17.990 --> 03:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
addresses many other concerns and I'm
 
03:50:20.229 --> 03:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions on it uh
 
03:50:22.990 --> 03:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
if anybody has any all right um
 
03:50:26.389 --> 03:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative turer uh I'm just curious
 
03:50:29.309 --> 03:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
has the Nea weighed in on this since the
 
03:50:31.229 --> 03:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
on this amendment uh are they now
 
03:50:33.269 --> 03:50:33.279 align:start position:0%
supportive of it or or is that sort of
 
03:50:35.149 --> 03:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
an open
 
03:50:38.229 --> 03:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
question so the Nea has reviewed it and
 
03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
they've kind of gone back and forth
 
03:50:41.950 --> 03:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
trying to reach consensus on it and just
 
03:50:44.510 --> 03:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
overall kind of were having a little bit
 
03:50:46.870 --> 03:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
of trouble because they were there was
 
03:50:49.750 --> 03:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
concern of well is this needed or not
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
but in terms of did this address their
 
03:50:53.950 --> 03:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
concerns I believe it did address their
 
03:50:56.349 --> 03:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
concerns but not they still just didn't
 
03:50:59.710 --> 03:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
feel that it was
 
03:51:02.990 --> 03:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
needed other representative Oregon um
 
03:51:04.469 --> 03:51:04.479 align:start position:0%
yes does
 
03:51:08.870 --> 03:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
this they have in line uh just in line
 
03:51:10.469 --> 03:51:10.479 align:start position:0%
12 on page one they talk about New
 
03:51:14.469 --> 03:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Educators is established by um
 
03:51:19.670 --> 03:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
RSA 29 and CC1 which um seems to only
 
03:51:23.030 --> 03:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
apply to um licensed and certified
 
03:51:27.550 --> 03:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
Educators so what does this do to um so
 
03:51:29.910 --> 03:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
what what does it what power would the
 
03:51:31.590 --> 03:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner have if there's U
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
misconduct by say an um so-called
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account provider or
 
03:51:39.710 --> 03:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
not all of whom are working at schools
 
03:51:42.389 --> 03:51:42.399 align:start position:0%
per se or there's also for example thing
 
03:51:44.110 --> 03:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
called the Learned anywhere program
 
03:51:46.349 --> 03:51:46.359 align:start position:0%
where you can uh get credit for
 
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
activities outside schools so and then
 
03:51:50.469 --> 03:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
of course there's other adults who are
 
03:51:52.870 --> 03:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
involved with children at least somewhat
 
03:51:55.630 --> 03:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
within the purview of uh the doe so does
 
03:51:58.070 --> 03:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
this allow the commissioner to
 
03:52:01.030 --> 03:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
investigate uh problems um involving
 
03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
programs like
 
03:52:06.349 --> 03:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question so this
 
03:52:08.830 --> 03:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
would not address that this only applies
 
03:52:10.950 --> 03:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
to licensed Educators who are licensed
 
03:52:13.070 --> 03:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education in in the
 
03:52:15.630 --> 03:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
sense of them being able to potentially
 
03:52:18.030 --> 03:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
take action on their their license so if
 
03:52:20.269 --> 03:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
you're not a licensed educator then they
 
03:52:23.630 --> 03:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
would have nothing to revoke from you
 
03:52:24.830 --> 03:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
you know can I just follow up and that
 
03:52:26.830 --> 03:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
is I I I just don't know the answer to
 
03:52:28.910 --> 03:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
this question but if there is a licensed
 
03:52:32.309 --> 03:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
educator who teaches at a private school
 
03:52:34.309 --> 03:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
I assume that the that the department
 
03:52:36.990 --> 03:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
would still have some authority over
 
03:52:37.000 --> 03:52:38.030 align:start position:0%
would still have some authority over
that

03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:40.110 align:start position:0%
that
person

03:52:40.110 --> 03:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:52:42.229 --> 03:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that question
 
03:52:45.269 --> 03:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
I can text the doe attorney to try and
 
03:52:45.279 --> 03:52:46.630 align:start position:0%
I can text the doe attorney to try and
find

03:52:46.630 --> 03:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
find
 
03:52:50.389 --> 03:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
out question to that is are they subject
 
03:52:52.750 --> 03:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
to the code of conduct because we're
 
03:52:55.510 --> 03:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
talking about violations of the code of
 
03:52:57.790 --> 03:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
conduct so if they're not subject to the
 
03:52:59.110 --> 03:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
code of conduct there can't be a
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
violation of the code of conduct so
 
03:53:03.550 --> 03:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:06.070 --> 03:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
enforce yeah I mean I I I just raised a
 
03:53:07.910 --> 03:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
question if I I don't know whether this
 
03:53:10.830 --> 03:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
is true or not maybe maybe the are I see
 
03:53:12.590 --> 03:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
someone in the audience who may have an
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
answer to that question but is is it
 
03:53:19.110 --> 03:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
possible for a c somebody who is
 
03:53:21.630 --> 03:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
licensed as a teacher to teach in a
 
03:53:24.469 --> 03:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
private school or does that if you do
 
03:53:26.590 --> 03:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
that you don't you're not subject to
 
03:53:28.269 --> 03:53:28.279 align:start position:0%
licensure anymore I I just don't know
 
03:53:30.149 --> 03:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question I do know
 
03:53:31.950 --> 03:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
for sure that there are some licensed
 
03:53:33.510 --> 03:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
teachers at private school that are in
 
03:53:35.189 --> 03:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
fact licensed but I'm waiting for
 
03:53:37.950 --> 03:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton to answer of course yeah
 
03:53:37.960 --> 03:53:46.750 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton to answer of course yeah
please

03:53:46.750 --> 03:53:46.760 align:start position:0%

03:54:01.030 --> 03:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
your to the questions I I I don't know
 
03:54:03.710 --> 03:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
if I have a direct answer but the the
 
03:54:05.590 --> 03:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
code of conduct through the Department
 
03:54:07.830 --> 03:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
of Education applies my understanding is
 
03:54:11.110 --> 03:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
to all certified Educators regardless of
 
03:54:12.790 --> 03:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
they're if they're teaching in
 
03:54:15.550 --> 03:54:15.560 align:start position:0%
a traditional Public School a chartered
 
03:54:17.990 --> 03:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
public school or a private school so we
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
may have a a certified educator at I at
 
03:54:23.670 --> 03:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
St John's little catholic school down
 
03:54:26.349 --> 03:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
the street here I pres I'm presuming
 
03:54:28.750 --> 03:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
that the code of conduct in general
 
03:54:31.389 --> 03:54:31.399 align:start position:0%
would apply to that individual the
 
03:54:33.910 --> 03:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
challenge that we might run into with
 
03:54:33.920 --> 03:54:35.710 align:start position:0%
challenge that we might run into with
certified

03:54:35.710 --> 03:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
certified
 
03:54:38.229 --> 03:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
individuals teaching at private schools
 
03:54:41.750 --> 03:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
is the priv private school may not have
 
03:54:43.510 --> 03:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
their teaching staff may not entirely be
 
03:54:44.750 --> 03:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
certified through the Department of
 
03:54:46.070 --> 03:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
Education they're allowed to have
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
non-certified staff there is a mandatory
 
03:54:51.429 --> 03:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement in the code of
 
03:54:54.910 --> 03:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
conduct so if a certified educator
 
03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
believes another certified educator has
 
03:54:59.710 --> 03:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
committed a violation of the code of
 
03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
conduct the certified educator who
 
03:55:03.309 --> 03:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
believes the violation has occurred has
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
a duty to report to the Department of
 
03:55:07.710 --> 03:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
Education so in a private school if you
 
03:55:10.670 --> 03:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
had a non-certified educator who thought
 
03:55:12.750 --> 03:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
there was a violation of the code of
 
03:55:15.189 --> 03:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
conduct by the certified educator the
 
03:55:17.110 --> 03:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
non-certified educator they could report
 
03:55:20.149 --> 03:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
but they don't have a duty to all right
 
03:55:23.030 --> 03:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I would just and I would just
 
03:55:26.790 --> 03:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
add also uh in in a somewhat similar
 
03:55:31.910 --> 03:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
respect uh Charters only require 50% of
 
03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
their uh teaching staff to be um
 
03:55:38.349 --> 03:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
certified and so you don't have all
 
03:55:38.359 --> 03:55:39.349 align:start position:0%
certified and so you don't have all
certified

03:55:39.349 --> 03:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
certified
 
03:55:42.149 --> 03:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
teachers in a in a in a public charter
 
03:55:44.429 --> 03:55:44.439 align:start position:0%
school but I think your question
 
03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn is does the Department of
 
03:55:48.670 --> 03:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
Education still have jurisdiction over
 
03:55:50.830 --> 03:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
that certified educator I believe they
 
03:55:52.510 --> 03:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
do regardless of where that certified
 
03:55:54.429 --> 03:55:54.439 align:start position:0%
educator is teaching that that logically
 
03:55:55.950 --> 03:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
would make sense to me if they were
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
certified I mean it's it it seems like
 
03:56:00.750 --> 03:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary things we're talking
 
03:56:00.760 --> 03:56:01.990 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary things we're talking
about

03:56:01.990 --> 03:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:56:05.309 --> 03:56:05.319 align:start position:0%
are that that not so much where you're
 
03:56:07.950 --> 03:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
working but what you've your conduct and
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
and if the if I would assume that you
 
03:56:14.110 --> 03:56:14.120 align:start position:0%
know take a take a whatever you know an
 
03:56:16.349 --> 03:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
obvious example of some misconduct would
 
03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
be having an inappropriate relationship
 
03:56:20.910 --> 03:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
with a student just hitting a kid
 
03:56:23.110 --> 03:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
something simple you lost your temper
 
03:56:24.910 --> 03:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
and you smacked a kid should it would
 
03:56:26.309 --> 03:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
seem to me if that's misconduct it's
 
03:56:27.790 --> 03:56:27.800 align:start position:0%
misconduct whether it's in a private
 
03:56:29.750 --> 03:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
school or a public school I would think
 
03:56:31.910 --> 03:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
so logic and law though I mean it's you
 
03:56:35.110 --> 03:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
know right all right uh representative
 
03:56:38.030 --> 03:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you um Mr Hawkins you do not
 
03:56:41.149 --> 03:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
have to answer this question um and I
 
03:56:43.590 --> 03:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
want to be clear about that but could
 
03:56:45.830 --> 03:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
you are you willing to tell the
 
03:56:50.030 --> 03:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee what um your organization's
 
03:56:53.149 --> 03:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:58.990 --> 03:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
amendment certainly um without uh uh
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
relating my our original testimony we
 
03:57:05.790 --> 03:57:05.800 align:start position:0%
still are opposed to the amendment um we
 
03:57:09.429 --> 03:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
don't think that it fixes the concerns
 
03:57:12.229 --> 03:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
um that we have
 
03:57:14.710 --> 03:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
um that's our position on the amendment
 
03:57:16.429 --> 03:57:16.439 align:start position:0%
all right other questions and of course
 
03:57:17.710 --> 03:57:17.720 align:start position:0%

can go okay all
right

04:02:23.630 --> 04:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:27.790 --> 04:02:27.800 align:start position:0%

1368 um prohibiting termination of a
 
04:02:49.550 --> 04:02:49.560 align:start position:0%

you thank you Joe uh thank thank you Mr
 
04:03:18.189 --> 04:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
chair um based on the information
 
04:03:19.710 --> 04:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
provided by the bill sponsor who
 
04:03:22.349 --> 04:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
identified the company as yield star I
 
04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
did not know that the bill was about
 
04:03:27.510 --> 04:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
price fixing on the Real Page app which
 
04:03:29.710 --> 04:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
I believe is a subsidiary of
 
04:03:31.830 --> 04:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
yieldstar I am familiar with the yield
 
04:03:33.750 --> 04:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
page in similar multif family housing
 
04:03:36.750 --> 04:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
software applications so the deal with
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is that
 
04:03:41.469 --> 04:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
um there have been several
 
04:03:46.950 --> 04:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
suits in States um against price
 
04:03:50.710 --> 04:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
fixing on multif Family Properties and
 
04:03:55.110 --> 04:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
what happens is that the um yield star
 
04:03:58.510 --> 04:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
owns rail page rail page manages multif
 
04:03:58.520 --> 04:04:00.269 align:start position:0%
owns rail page rail page manages multif
family

04:04:00.269 --> 04:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:04:04.110 --> 04:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
housing rail page um has a financial
 
04:04:06.630 --> 04:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
software package that includes the
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
property budgeting um um property
 
04:04:13.309 --> 04:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
expenses income expenses budgeting and
 
04:04:17.710 --> 04:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
on the income line the there's an
 
04:04:20.469 --> 04:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
algorithm that is automatically into the
 
04:04:24.790 --> 04:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
system that raises rent in steps and the
 
04:04:26.590 --> 04:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
problem is
 
04:04:32.149 --> 04:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
that when Real Page UPS those Rents It
 
04:04:34.590 --> 04:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
it affects thousands of units across
 
04:04:37.790 --> 04:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
their portfolio so the government sees
 
04:04:40.269 --> 04:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
that that as price
 
04:04:40.279 --> 04:04:42.269 align:start position:0%
that that as price
fixing

04:04:42.269 --> 04:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
fixing
 
04:04:45.550 --> 04:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
um and so first of all I thought that
 
04:04:47.429 --> 04:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
the bill we probably belonged in
 
04:04:49.710 --> 04:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee um since it was a
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
series of antitrust suits for Price
 
04:04:54.710 --> 04:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
setting at any rate it is unknown if a
 
04:04:57.670 --> 04:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
suit was initiated in New Hampshire I
 
04:04:59.269 --> 04:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
think it would be unwise for a New
 
04:05:01.030 --> 04:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tenant under nonpayment
 
04:05:03.149 --> 04:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
eviction to test the courts by refusing
 
04:05:04.590 --> 04:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
to pay the increased
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
rents I am thinking the bill should be
 
04:05:08.950 --> 04:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
itl since we do not have a New Hampshire
 
04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
ruling on it um it's not so much a landl
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
tenant issue it's a price fixing
 
04:05:17.630 --> 04:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
issue I of course I would defer to our
 
04:05:19.389 --> 04:05:19.399 align:start position:0%
lawyers on the house Judiciary Committee
 
04:05:22.950 --> 04:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
to um tell me otherwise thank
 
04:05:27.070 --> 04:05:27.080 align:start position:0%

1432
 
04:06:48.110 --> 04:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
um uh I I want to uh here I want to ask
 
04:06:52.149 --> 04:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
representative Manos to to uh uh discuss
 
04:06:54.269 --> 04:06:54.279 align:start position:0%
this but I what I would like to say
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
before we get to that is um I think
 
04:06:58.830 --> 04:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be ready to vote on
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
this today for a couple of reasons first
 
04:07:03.149 --> 04:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
of all
 
04:07:05.189 --> 04:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
um we without even getting to
 
04:07:07.389 --> 04:07:07.399 align:start position:0%
representative Manos is uh proposed
 
04:07:09.630 --> 04:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
amendment which I at least parts of
 
04:07:12.149 --> 04:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
which I I think are very good and maybe
 
04:07:16.110 --> 04:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
maybe even more than Parts but um the I
 
04:07:20.189 --> 04:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
think there are two issues one the um
 
04:07:20.199 --> 04:07:23.109 align:start position:0%
think there are two issues one the um
the

04:07:23.109 --> 04:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:28.590 --> 04:07:28.600 align:start position:0%
um the communications industry who um I
 
04:07:31.790 --> 04:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
have who I think were here at the for
 
04:07:34.670 --> 04:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
the hearing but I've had some po hearing
 
04:07:37.309 --> 04:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
Communications with them have raised had
 
04:07:40.109 --> 04:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
raised some concerns several of which I
 
04:07:42.070 --> 04:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
agreed with and made changes one of
 
04:07:43.830 --> 04:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
which I was
 
04:07:46.189 --> 04:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
questioning uh until yesterday and I got
 
04:07:48.189 --> 04:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
some further information that led me to
 
04:07:50.269 --> 04:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
think that the points that they raised
 
04:07:53.149 --> 04:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
about political advertising paid
 
04:07:55.189 --> 04:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
political advertising that I had some
 
04:07:57.269 --> 04:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
questions about I think they're they
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
they showed me some Authority that I
 
04:08:02.469 --> 04:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
think says that they're correct
 
04:08:04.990 --> 04:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
um uh and so I think we would need to
 
04:08:07.349 --> 04:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
make some changes anyway then we have
 
04:08:09.149 --> 04:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
repes resentative Manos has a proposed
 
04:08:10.870 --> 04:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
amendment which I as I said I think has
 
04:08:13.950 --> 04:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
some very valid points um and then the
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
last thing is um we have artificial
 
04:08:19.510 --> 04:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
intelligence bills before four
 
04:08:22.790 --> 04:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
committees um and I'm told that there is
 
04:08:24.750 --> 04:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
there are some significant conflicts
 
04:08:27.389 --> 04:08:27.399 align:start position:0%
between for example what we Define as
 
04:08:30.030 --> 04:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence so it's probably
 
04:08:32.030 --> 04:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
not a good idea for us to send some to
 
04:08:36.630 --> 04:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
the floor um right away um hopefully
 
04:08:38.590 --> 04:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
over the next week because we do have to
 
04:08:41.469 --> 04:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
act on this by next week and I I would
 
04:08:44.550 --> 04:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
if possible like to move something
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
forward um uh so we're going to have to
 
04:08:51.109 --> 04:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
act pretty quickly but um that's I think
 
04:08:52.630 --> 04:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
probably what was likely to happen with
 
04:08:55.990 --> 04:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
1432 representative Manos um I turned
 
04:08:59.109 --> 04:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
the floor over to you thank you Mr chair
 
04:09:02.990 --> 04:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
um uh my cohort on working on this
 
04:09:05.229 --> 04:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
amendment is representative Corman and
 
04:09:07.790 --> 04:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
he's here and so the committee might
 
04:09:09.630 --> 04:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
want to hear from him because he has
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
expertise in this area this is um
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative gon's underlying Bill and
 
04:09:20.429 --> 04:09:20.439 align:start position:0%
um I work to make some changes to it I
 
04:09:22.149 --> 04:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
distributed the
 
04:09:25.429 --> 04:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
amendment um my there are four different
 
04:09:29.309 --> 04:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
committees that have proposed uh bills
 
04:09:34.349 --> 04:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
on that intersect or relate to AI um and
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
those committees are our committee
 
04:09:41.790 --> 04:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
criminal law Edna and election law um my
 
04:09:43.269 --> 04:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
understanding is that representative
 
04:09:46.349 --> 04:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
Smith communicated with the speaker to
 
04:09:49.590 --> 04:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
ask him for about the possibility of a
 
04:09:52.109 --> 04:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
special committee so that we could the
 
04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
four committees could reconcile their
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
definitions of artificial intelligence
 
04:10:00.030 --> 04:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
um and I think several of the bills
 
04:10:02.109 --> 04:10:02.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps at least this bill deals with
 
04:10:04.870 --> 04:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
deep fakes um and so that's another
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
issue that might need to be reconciled
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
across committees um so um the purpose
 
04:10:18.109 --> 04:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
of my Amendment um is to um start with
 
04:10:21.189 --> 04:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
representative gon's underlying Bill and
 
04:10:26.070 --> 04:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
strengthen it and use um Professor
 
04:10:28.389 --> 04:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
Corman representative Corman helped me
 
04:10:30.510 --> 04:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
with the definition of artificial
 
04:10:33.550 --> 04:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
intelligence the definition of deep fake
 
04:10:38.830 --> 04:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
so we've um used those um um and
 
04:10:40.990 --> 04:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
then um we
 
04:10:45.189 --> 04:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
included um audio which I believe was
 
04:10:48.149 --> 04:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
not included in representative Grayson's
 
04:10:50.870 --> 04:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
bill um we
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
also as I understand it representative
 
04:11:00.790 --> 04:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
gon had proposed that um for example if
 
04:11:05.149 --> 04:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
I if there's a deep fake of me created
 
04:11:09.429 --> 04:11:09.439 align:start position:0%
that shows me threatening another person
 
04:11:12.469 --> 04:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
and I am arrested for
 
04:11:15.550 --> 04:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
that that pursuing to representative
 
04:11:19.309 --> 04:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
gon's Bill the person who created the
 
04:11:24.670 --> 04:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
Deep fake would then be charged with a a
 
04:11:28.149 --> 04:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
level of crime that corresponds with the
 
04:11:31.349 --> 04:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
level of crime that I have been charged
 
04:11:35.389 --> 04:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
with um and we changed that in this so
 
04:11:38.109 --> 04:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
04:11:40.870 --> 04:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
person that created the Deep fake would
 
04:11:43.349 --> 04:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
be charged with the clas B felony and we
 
04:11:47.710 --> 04:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
just left it at that um I think there
 
04:11:51.309 --> 04:11:51.319 align:start position:0%
could be problems with um judicial
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
scrutiny on charging the creator of the
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
deep fake with um a with a level of
 
04:12:04.349 --> 04:12:04.359 align:start position:0%
crime that's not related to the crime
 
04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
that that person actually committed um
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
so that was another change we made um we
 
04:12:15.550 --> 04:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
did take out the um section
 
04:12:20.349 --> 04:12:20.359 align:start position:0%
on um election law and the reason that
 
04:12:22.910 --> 04:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
we did that was because the election law
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
committee has a bill relating to Ai and
 
04:12:28.750 --> 04:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
we felt that it was more appropriate for
 
04:12:31.309 --> 04:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
them to deal with that constellation of
 
04:12:33.910 --> 04:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
issues rather than for it to be dealt
 
04:12:36.269 --> 04:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
with peac meal between two different
 
04:12:40.910 --> 04:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
committees so we did that and um I
 
04:12:43.670 --> 04:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
created a side by side comparison so you
 
04:12:46.590 --> 04:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
can visually see the changes we made
 
04:12:48.349 --> 04:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
because the version of the amendment
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
that um OS provided did not have the um
 
04:12:55.790 --> 04:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
the interlacing or the interlining and
 
04:12:59.109 --> 04:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
the red lining um so I think those are
 
04:13:01.910 --> 04:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
the highlights of the changes that we
 
04:13:04.990 --> 04:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
made but it might be very helpful to
 
04:13:08.429 --> 04:13:08.439 align:start position:0%
hear from representative Corman with his
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
um deep Professional Knowledge and
 
04:13:11.040 --> 04:13:12.950 align:start position:0%
um deep Professional Knowledge and
academic

04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
academic
 
04:13:14.750 --> 04:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
expertise I'm sorry representative
 
04:13:16.070 --> 04:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
Corman I wonder if we could ask you to
 
04:13:18.990 --> 04:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
just come up and share your wisdom with
 
04:13:19.000 --> 04:13:26.229 align:start position:0%
just come up and share your wisdom with
us

04:13:26.229 --> 04:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:28.349 --> 04:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman for the
 
04:13:31.349 --> 04:13:31.359 align:start position:0%
record Tom Corman I represent the fight
 
04:13:35.469 --> 04:13:35.479 align:start position:0%
15th Grafton 15 which is W 3 of
 
04:13:38.510 --> 04:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
Lebanon I was a computer science
 
04:13:41.269 --> 04:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
professor at Dartmouth for 29 and a half
 
04:13:44.550 --> 04:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
years I have degrees in computer science
 
04:13:46.269 --> 04:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
from Princeton and graduate my
 
04:13:48.389 --> 04:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
undergradu from Princeton my grad from
 
04:13:52.030 --> 04:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
MIT uh AI I should say is was not my
 
04:13:54.189 --> 04:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
research area my research area was
 
04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
algorithms I co-authored the leading
 
04:13:57.950 --> 04:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
textbook on computer
 
04:14:00.269 --> 04:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
algorithms that said I chaired the
 
04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
computer science dep department at
 
04:14:04.910 --> 04:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth for six years and I had to
 
04:14:06.349 --> 04:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
really keep a breast of what was going
 
04:14:09.070 --> 04:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
on in the field of course I've I I've
 
04:14:11.109 --> 04:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
actually been in computer science for 50
 
04:14:12.710 --> 04:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
years and I've tracked what's going on
 
04:14:17.389 --> 04:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
in Ai and I was very concerned about the
 
04:14:20.750 --> 04:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
potential for misuse of AI so I filed uh
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
hb1 1688 which went to Edna and that
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
bill restricts what our state agencies
 
04:14:29.429 --> 04:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
are allowed to do with AI and
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
subsequently I learned about bills in
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
other committees uh HB 1596 an election
 
04:14:37.670 --> 04:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
law filed by representative Brennan HB
 
04:14:40.309 --> 04:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
1500 in criminal justice filed by
 
04:14:42.630 --> 04:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative mamila and then the bill
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
here filed by representative gon uh
 
04:14:47.630 --> 04:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
talking with representative Manos you
 
04:14:49.910 --> 04:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
know we realize that yes these bills all
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
have different definitions of AI and
 
04:14:55.830 --> 04:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
deep fakes and it seems that that could
 
04:15:00.070 --> 04:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
be a real problem going forward so we do
 
04:15:02.590 --> 04:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
need a consistent definition ideally
 
04:15:04.710 --> 04:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
what we'd like to see would be a place
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
in law that has the definition and then
 
04:15:11.189 --> 04:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
the other uh parts of law just refer to
 
04:15:13.790 --> 04:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
that particular section of the RSA the
 
04:15:16.590 --> 04:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
problem is that with four bills being
 
04:15:18.990 --> 04:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
filed simultaneously we have no idea
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
which ones go forward and therefore
 
04:15:23.710 --> 04:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
which ones we can even reference so at
 
04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
this point it probably makes the most
 
04:15:28.469 --> 04:15:28.479 align:start position:0%
sense to uh just try to get a consistent
 
04:15:32.269 --> 04:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
definition in each of the bills uh I
 
04:15:34.510 --> 04:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
should mention also 1500 the one in
 
04:15:37.349 --> 04:15:37.359 align:start position:0%
criminal justice uh it hasn't gone to
 
04:15:40.030 --> 04:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
the floor yet but it was unanimously
 
04:15:42.510 --> 04:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
voted for interim study by criminal
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
justice so it it won't really be acted
 
04:15:48.389 --> 04:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
on this year the other bills are still
 
04:15:52.830 --> 04:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
alive uh the the the one I filed um 1688
 
04:15:57.550 --> 04:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
Inna is most most likely going to a
 
04:16:00.269 --> 04:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um yeah
 
04:16:02.790 --> 04:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
so we had concerns about the definition
 
04:16:05.790 --> 04:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
of AI and also the definition of deep
 
04:16:09.109 --> 04:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
fakes and in fact in the amendment that
 
04:16:10.830 --> 04:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh that was distributed the one that
 
04:16:13.710 --> 04:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
representative mtis and I wrote uh this
 
04:16:15.229 --> 04:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
morning I discovered yeah we admitted
 
04:16:17.349 --> 04:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
one other thing uh probably be good to
 
04:16:21.429 --> 04:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
put in um and specifically about the
 
04:16:24.710 --> 04:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh representative gon and
 
04:16:27.149 --> 04:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
chair Lyn filed that that representative
 
04:16:29.149 --> 04:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
maners and I were looking at one of the
 
04:16:31.070 --> 04:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
things we realized is it's actually not
 
04:16:33.790 --> 04:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
as much about AI as it is about deep
 
04:16:36.910 --> 04:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
fakes so we changed some of the headings
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
to replace artificial intelligence by
 
04:16:42.550 --> 04:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
Deep fake but we need a definition of
 
04:16:44.349 --> 04:16:44.359 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence within the
 
04:16:46.429 --> 04:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
definition of deep fake so we left the
 
04:16:48.590 --> 04:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
definition of artificial intelligence in
 
04:16:52.030 --> 04:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
there um and then also as representative
 
04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
Mano said uh our Amendment removes the
 
04:16:57.070 --> 04:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
section on Election law because there is
 
04:16:59.630 --> 04:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
a bill in election law
 
04:17:01.990 --> 04:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
1596 and it just seems to make more
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
sense to allow that committee to work on
 
04:17:06.269 --> 04:17:06.279 align:start position:0%
it but you I am very concerned that we
 
04:17:08.429 --> 04:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
get the definition consistent we spoke
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
with representative Smith yesterday on
 
04:17:14.309 --> 04:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
Sunday and and uh we're hoping to get
 
04:17:17.750 --> 04:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
some sort of committee together to at at
 
04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
the very least come up with a standard
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
definition of AI generative AI which
 
04:17:26.710 --> 04:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
appears in in my bill and deep
 
04:17:30.429 --> 04:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
fake right so I um no well thank no
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that um I guess
 
04:17:37.229 --> 04:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
what what I um what I I'd like to
 
04:17:38.990 --> 04:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
suggest and I want to hear from others I
 
04:17:43.710 --> 04:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to suggest is that we um
 
04:17:46.670 --> 04:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
we not vote on this today and that very
 
04:17:52.269 --> 04:17:52.279 align:start position:0%
quickly meaning you know uh starting uh
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
within within the next week we get
 
04:17:56.070 --> 04:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
together with the four with the four
 
04:18:00.990 --> 04:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
committees um uh to to sort of make sure
 
04:18:03.990 --> 04:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
that we may not we may not be able to
 
04:18:05.830 --> 04:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
cons it probably would not make sense to
 
04:18:08.109 --> 04:18:08.119 align:start position:0%
com to consolidate them all into one
 
04:18:09.910 --> 04:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill but what we should have is I think
 
04:18:12.429 --> 04:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
as you suggest at least a consistent
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
definition of what AI is and what a deep
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
fake is um and then if there you know if
 
04:18:21.269 --> 04:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
election law wants to have its its uh
 
04:18:24.750 --> 04:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
bill for election law uh and us for
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
non-election law uh that may make sense
 
04:18:28.990 --> 04:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative Gon Do you have any
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:34.469 --> 04:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
this well I like the amendment uh and I
 
04:18:36.389 --> 04:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
like what's been done I think it has
 
04:18:38.189 --> 04:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
been done with really good intentions
 
04:18:40.710 --> 04:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
and very well very well done uh taking
 
04:18:44.309 --> 04:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
out the election law part of it is uh
 
04:18:45.710 --> 04:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
completely acceptable I understand the
 
04:18:47.710 --> 04:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind it I had put it in
 
04:18:49.550 --> 04:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
there not knowing about the existence of
 
04:18:52.149 --> 04:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
the other bills so no no issues with
 
04:18:54.550 --> 04:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
that at all I like what has been done uh
 
04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
I do think uniformity in definitions is
 
04:19:00.349 --> 04:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
essential um otherwise we just create
 
04:19:05.429 --> 04:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
chaos so I I I like I like the amendment
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh there are two things
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
that have to be in a bill for me to
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
support it and that is a personal right
 
04:19:13.870 --> 04:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
of action the private right of action
 
04:19:15.429 --> 04:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
where a person who as the victim can go
 
04:19:16.710 --> 04:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
after the person who who's the
 
04:19:19.349 --> 04:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
perpetrator and then a penalty for the
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
person who did it uh a criminal penalty
 
04:19:24.990 --> 04:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
so the class B felony I'm all over that
 
04:19:27.750 --> 04:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's totally cool with me um so
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
you guys you guys maintain the
 
04:19:31.189 --> 04:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
objectives that we were going for there
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
at least as far as I was concerned um as
 
04:19:37.149 --> 04:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
far as um uh putting it together with
 
04:19:38.550 --> 04:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
with the amendment that representative
 
04:19:42.109 --> 04:19:42.119 align:start position:0%
Lynn and I had um I'd have to do another
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
side by side with that to see if there's
 
04:19:45.229 --> 04:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
anything that we needed to pick out of
 
04:19:47.389 --> 04:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
there but just from first blush I like
 
04:19:50.030 --> 04:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment and think we need to at
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
least take this see what the other uh uh
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
committees have and then make sure that
 
04:19:56.269 --> 04:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
we have a a de definition going forward
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
but next week we need to have something
 
04:19:59.550 --> 04:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
we we we need to take at least one of
 
04:20:01.790 --> 04:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
these four bills needs to go to the
 
04:20:04.109 --> 04:20:04.119 align:start position:0%
floor in the next couple of weeks
 
04:20:06.149 --> 04:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
representative Alex preferably this one
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and I want to
 
04:20:10.109 --> 04:20:10.119 align:start position:0%
thank representative gon I think this is
 
04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
an important bill to start the
 
04:20:15.189 --> 04:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
conversation with um I you know I
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
studied public policy and the first
 
04:20:18.990 --> 04:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
thing you talk about when you you study
 
04:20:20.710 --> 04:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
get your Masters in public policy is
 
04:20:21.910 --> 04:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
public policy is a study of what
 
04:20:24.309 --> 04:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
government should do and not do and I
 
04:20:26.910 --> 04:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
think in this situation we should do
 
04:20:29.469 --> 04:20:29.479 align:start position:0%
something right but we have to pump the
 
04:20:31.469 --> 04:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
brakes on how fast this is being done I
 
04:20:33.389 --> 04:20:33.399 align:start position:0%
think with when you have multiple bills
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
in different committees discussing
 
04:20:36.269 --> 04:20:36.279 align:start position:0%
different parts of AI I think we need to
 
04:20:38.349 --> 04:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
be very very careful about coming up
 
04:20:39.870 --> 04:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
with definitions of things that we
 
04:20:41.830 --> 04:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
actually don't know like what the
 
04:20:44.030 --> 04:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
development of AI is going to look like
 
04:20:46.349 --> 04:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
in six months from now like it's it's to
 
04:20:48.109 --> 04:20:48.119 align:start position:0%
me it's a really scary Prospect like
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
this is something that's evolving right
 
04:20:53.630 --> 04:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
in front of our eyes so I I appreciate
 
04:20:55.870 --> 04:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
the conversation being started I wish
 
04:20:57.469 --> 04:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
the federal government would act on this
 
04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
and the states didn't have to but if we
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
have to act I think we should um but I
 
04:21:06.510 --> 04:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
caution and I I just want to pump the
 
04:21:08.510 --> 04:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
breaks on all of these AI bills I think
 
04:21:11.070 --> 04:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
we're moving too quickly I think putting
 
04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
together commiss I hate commissions
 
04:21:14.910 --> 04:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes but like this is one of these
 
04:21:16.590 --> 04:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
broad ranging topics that we have so
 
04:21:18.109 --> 04:21:18.119 align:start position:0%
many bills in different committees it
 
04:21:19.790 --> 04:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
might be useful to do a commission or a
 
04:21:21.149 --> 04:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
study committee or something like that
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
but looking at the the language of this
 
04:21:24.510 --> 04:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
and then comparing it to other bills and
 
04:21:26.030 --> 04:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
other committees I think we're moving
 
04:21:28.510 --> 04:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
way too quick so I just caution the
 
04:21:30.710 --> 04:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
committee and the legislature to slow
 
04:21:32.429 --> 04:21:32.439 align:start position:0%
down a little bit let's take a breath
 
04:21:34.389 --> 04:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
figure out what the best steps forward
 
04:21:36.469 --> 04:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
are let's study it and then move forward
 
04:21:38.070 --> 04:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
with the best product when we know what
 
04:21:41.389 --> 04:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
we're actually talking about thanks what
 
04:21:44.030 --> 04:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative Manos thank you I ju I
 
04:21:47.910 --> 04:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to um point out to
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative grion in in particular
 
04:21:54.030 --> 04:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
that on page two Roman numeral 2 we do
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
have a private right of action so that
 
04:21:58.670 --> 04:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
is in there and could you just remind me
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:09.109 --> 04:22:09.119 align:start position:0%
was changed the the penalty
 
04:22:12.469 --> 04:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
for you're your example of you you
 
04:22:14.469 --> 04:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
somebody makes a video of you harming
 
04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
someone there's a penalty that goes with
 
04:22:18.510 --> 04:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
that you've been arrested for that so
 
04:22:21.389 --> 04:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
it's determined is a deep fake that the
 
04:22:22.790 --> 04:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
charging somebody with the crime
 
04:22:25.349 --> 04:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
equivalent to the crime that you were
 
04:22:27.070 --> 04:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
you just made a class be felony right
 
04:22:28.830 --> 04:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with that so you protected the
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
two things I wanted to be protected yes
 
04:22:32.710 --> 04:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative M um the other thing I
 
04:22:34.990 --> 04:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to just emphasize is that we did
 
04:22:37.950 --> 04:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
put in here because one of the outcomes
 
04:22:40.630 --> 04:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
of this situation if if somebody makes a
 
04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
deep fake of me threatening somebody and
 
04:22:45.349 --> 04:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'm arrested for that then I'm going to
 
04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
have expenses of Defense I'm going to
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
have costs for a an expert to say this
 
04:22:54.189 --> 04:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
is a deep fake and it isn't reality and
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
so we did add in here that you can um
 
04:23:02.109 --> 04:23:02.119 align:start position:0%
also recover your a cost for defense and
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
for uh uh
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:07.990 align:start position:0%
for uh uh
Witnesses

04:23:07.990 --> 04:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
Witnesses
 
04:23:10.950 --> 04:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative Andrew thank you Mr
 
04:23:13.870 --> 04:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
chair after listening to everybody and
 
04:23:16.149 --> 04:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
being not being knowledgeable in this
 
04:23:19.590 --> 04:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
whole area I believe that either interim
 
04:23:21.750 --> 04:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
study or a commission or something
 
04:23:24.030 --> 04:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to do should come
 
04:23:26.670 --> 04:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
about I mean if we have four
 
04:23:29.149 --> 04:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
bills and everybody's putting in their
 
04:23:31.670 --> 04:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
own definitions we're wasting a lot of
 
04:23:34.670 --> 04:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
time and I believe people should get
 
04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
together from all four committee
 
04:23:40.349 --> 04:23:40.359 align:start position:0%
and come up with standard
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
definitions right other representative
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
Perez I think we need to put something
 
04:23:49.229 --> 04:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
in place sooner rather than later and
 
04:23:51.229 --> 04:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
then as we were told on earlier bills
 
04:23:54.429 --> 04:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
the legislation can go ahead and tweak
 
04:23:56.309 --> 04:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
it if they want
 
04:23:59.990 --> 04:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
to any other comment yes yes sir please
 
04:24:02.070 --> 04:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you Mr chairman so uh a
 
04:24:04.030 --> 04:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
couple of uh things I want to say to
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander's comments and
 
04:24:07.950 --> 04:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
I certainly understand your point Mr
 
04:24:10.070 --> 04:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
chair is this a member of the committee
 
04:24:11.990 --> 04:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
or are we I guess I'm wondering like
 
04:24:14.990 --> 04:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
where in exact like is another member of
 
04:24:17.469 --> 04:24:17.479 align:start position:0%
the committee allowed to reut a member
 
04:24:19.870 --> 04:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I guess I'm wondering like I I get
 
04:24:21.790 --> 04:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
it if he was like a sitting member of
 
04:24:25.389 --> 04:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
the executive session but I I I'm
 
04:24:27.670 --> 04:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
confused well well
 
04:24:31.269 --> 04:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
I if I guess we have a subject yeah
 
04:24:32.750 --> 04:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
somebody who has a great deal of subject
 
04:24:34.870 --> 04:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
matter we invited him to be here I think
 
04:24:36.349 --> 04:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
we should hear from him so please please
 
04:24:40.870 --> 04:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
continue thank you Mr chair so uh when
 
04:24:44.149 --> 04:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
hb500 was heard in criminal justice this
 
04:24:46.149 --> 04:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
whole question about the definitions
 
04:24:49.349 --> 04:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
came up and chairman Roy actually came
 
04:24:51.550 --> 04:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
to me afterward and suggested the very
 
04:24:53.830 --> 04:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
commission that that people have talked
 
04:24:56.109 --> 04:24:56.119 align:start position:0%
about and asked if I would be on it and
 
04:24:58.429 --> 04:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
I said sure and he did contact the
 
04:25:00.830 --> 04:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
speaker about it and the speaker did not
 
04:25:02.790 --> 04:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
express interest in creating such a
 
04:25:05.830 --> 04:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
commission so uh we would need to
 
04:25:05.840 --> 04:25:06.990 align:start position:0%
commission so uh we would need to
actually

04:25:06.990 --> 04:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:25:08.910 --> 04:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
have some sort of legislation rather
 
04:25:11.070 --> 04:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
than than something that the speaker
 
04:25:14.030 --> 04:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
creates the other thing I would say is
 
04:25:17.109 --> 04:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
that as a back stop if these bills go
 
04:25:20.030 --> 04:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
through without consistent definitions I
 
04:25:22.149 --> 04:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
suppose there is the possibility of when
 
04:25:24.590 --> 04:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
they get to the Senate telling the
 
04:25:26.429 --> 04:25:26.439 align:start position:0%
senate about this and asking them to
 
04:25:28.990 --> 04:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
amend the bills to make the definitions
 
04:25:31.309 --> 04:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
consistent you know can I well I guess
 
04:25:33.630 --> 04:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to suggest because I I I
 
04:25:34.830 --> 04:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
understand your point representative
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
Alexander but I guess guess what I would
 
04:25:41.269 --> 04:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
like to suggest is is this would it make
 
04:25:41.279 --> 04:25:42.590 align:start position:0%
like to suggest is is this would it make
sense

04:25:42.590 --> 04:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
for um representative Manos myself
 
04:25:46.000 --> 04:25:47.109 align:start position:0%
for um representative Manos myself
representative

04:25:47.109 --> 04:25:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:25:50.670 --> 04:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
gon um uh and I don't want to I don't
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
want to get a subcommittee too big but
 
04:25:54.950 --> 04:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
but representative Manos myself
 
04:25:57.070 --> 04:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative grion and hopefully you
 
04:25:59.429 --> 04:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
would be willing to uh to join us as
 
04:26:03.870 --> 04:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
sort of an next parte um to get together
 
04:26:08.910 --> 04:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
early next week and see if we can I'll
 
04:26:10.309 --> 04:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
I'll have been in touch with the with
 
04:26:13.229 --> 04:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
the other four chairs see if we
 
04:26:17.189 --> 04:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
can sort of fix this in a timely way to
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
be able to exec next Wednesday if it
 
04:26:22.429 --> 04:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
turns out that we can't do that that
 
04:26:24.510 --> 04:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's you know that it really is or we're
 
04:26:25.950 --> 04:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
not comfortable because we feel like
 
04:26:28.229 --> 04:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
we're moving too quickly then maybe the
 
04:26:30.149 --> 04:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing is an interim study
 
04:26:33.189 --> 04:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
motion but I would really I mean I agree
 
04:26:34.309 --> 04:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
with representative Perez and
 
04:26:36.510 --> 04:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative grion that to me the
 
04:26:39.149 --> 04:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
preferred thing would be to move forward
 
04:26:41.109 --> 04:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that we're doing it
 
04:26:43.389 --> 04:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
consistently um with the other
 
04:26:46.030 --> 04:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
committees does that does that make that
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
make sense as a way to move
 
04:26:52.109 --> 04:26:52.119 align:start position:0%
forward man thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:26:53.590 --> 04:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
that does make sense to me I just wanted
 
04:26:55.550 --> 04:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
to point out that the election committee
 
04:26:57.590 --> 04:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
does plan on executing their version of
 
04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
the bill on Monday Al I also sit on
 
04:27:04.030 --> 04:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
Election so um they plan on executing
 
04:27:05.670 --> 04:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
that all their bills on Monday they
 
04:27:07.870 --> 04:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to hold on to any more bills
 
04:27:10.229 --> 04:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
so just to put that out there but I
 
04:27:13.590 --> 04:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
suppose if where if you were going to go
 
04:27:15.469 --> 04:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
in the direction of keeping I know it
 
04:27:17.469 --> 04:27:17.479 align:start position:0%
originally had the election section in
 
04:27:19.309 --> 04:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
there like maybe that committee could
 
04:27:22.309 --> 04:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
just itl it if you guys are going to be
 
04:27:23.870 --> 04:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
fixing that particular area but just
 
04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to point that out okay um do do
 
04:27:29.309 --> 04:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
you ever do you have representative man
 
04:27:31.550 --> 04:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
or does anybody Happ to know what the is
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
the definition of AI in the election law
 
04:27:36.309 --> 04:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
Bill different than than this this one
 
04:27:38.590 --> 04:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
it is okay all right representative
 
04:27:41.269 --> 04:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
Manos I I just wanted to point out that
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
um or remind remind us that
 
04:27:46.030 --> 04:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I believe did reach
 
04:27:48.189 --> 04:27:48.199 align:start position:0%
out to the speaker he did decline it the
 
04:27:49.510 --> 04:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
first time and then I think
 
04:27:51.309 --> 04:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
representative Smith reached out to him
 
04:27:54.149 --> 04:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
a second time to ask about a special
 
04:27:58.030 --> 04:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
committee and um maybe that'll uh if I
 
04:28:00.510 --> 04:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
could respond to that yes I did I sent
 
04:28:04.710 --> 04:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
an email to him and copied the uh the
 
04:28:07.229 --> 04:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
chairs and the rank ing members of the
 
04:28:10.830 --> 04:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
four committees I haven't had a response
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
um we all know how busy he is um I uh
 
04:28:19.189 --> 04:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
just a little while ago did send um a
 
04:28:23.030 --> 04:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
copy of that to uh the chief of staff uh
 
04:28:23.040 --> 04:28:24.429 align:start position:0%
copy of that to uh the chief of staff uh
to

04:28:24.429 --> 04:28:24.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:28:27.149 --> 04:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
say perhaps the speaker hadn't had a
 
04:28:29.710 --> 04:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
chance yet to look at that okay and I I
 
04:28:33.229 --> 04:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
did I I did the same I also um left
 
04:28:34.870 --> 04:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
messages for the speaker saying I wanted
 
04:28:36.309 --> 04:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
to talk you know talked to him about a
 
04:28:37.469 --> 04:28:37.479 align:start position:0%
couple of things but this was one of
 
04:28:38.990 --> 04:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
them and I haven't heard back from him
 
04:28:41.870 --> 04:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
yet but um I mean I I will make it a
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
point to to reach out to him again um so
 
04:28:48.070 --> 04:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
I guess I mean does that does that make
 
04:28:50.349 --> 04:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
sense as a way forward to appoint this
 
04:28:52.189 --> 04:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with an idea that we'll
 
04:28:53.910 --> 04:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
we'll work we'll get together very
 
04:28:57.269 --> 04:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
quickly um and try to try to do uh to do
 
04:28:59.309 --> 04:28:59.319 align:start position:0%
something on this does that make sense
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
all right so then why don't uh uh why
 
04:29:06.389 --> 04:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
don't we do that and uh we'll
 
04:29:09.630 --> 04:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be back next week been a
 
04:29:11.550 --> 04:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to exec this and thank
 
04:29:13.269 --> 04:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much cor really
 
04:29:16.510 --> 04:29:16.520 align:start position:0%

04:29:16.520 --> 04:29:19.710 align:start position:0%
appreciate it all right
um

04:29:19.710 --> 04:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:19.720 --> 04:29:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
1497

04:29:21.910 --> 04:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
1497
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
um uh restricting trial courts trial
 
04:29:26.670 --> 04:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
courts in criminal Matters from imposing
 
04:29:28.670 --> 04:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
certain sentences following a plea
 
04:29:33.510 --> 04:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
bargain um do I have a motion on that
 
04:29:36.910 --> 04:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
anybody wish to make a motion on that
 
04:29:40.990 --> 04:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
um all right well then I 1497 I'll make
 
04:29:43.309 --> 04:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
the motion of
 
04:29:48.389 --> 04:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
itl seconded by representative Smith um
 
04:29:48.399 --> 04:29:53.790 align:start position:0%
itl seconded by representative Smith um
I

04:29:53.790 --> 04:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:56.550 --> 04:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
um I think there's not a lot to say
 
04:30:00.389 --> 04:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
about this uh it proposes to limit the
 
04:30:04.830 --> 04:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
bill proposes to limit um a Court's
 
04:30:07.429 --> 04:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
authority to ose a sentence if a person
 
04:30:09.070 --> 04:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
rejects a plea
 
04:30:09.080 --> 04:30:12.070 align:start position:0%
rejects a plea
bargain

04:30:12.070 --> 04:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
bargain
 
04:30:15.870 --> 04:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
um plea bargaining is a huge part of the
 
04:30:19.030 --> 04:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system over 90% of
 
04:30:20.990 --> 04:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
cases are resolved by some kind of a
 
04:30:23.630 --> 04:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
plea bargain
 
04:30:23.640 --> 04:30:25.790 align:start position:0%
plea bargain
um

04:30:25.790 --> 04:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:30.070 --> 04:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
the if you actually had a system that
 
04:30:30.080 --> 04:30:31.670 align:start position:0%
the if you actually had a system that
prevented

04:30:31.670 --> 04:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
prevented
 
04:30:36.429 --> 04:30:36.439 align:start position:0%
courts from imposing a sentence that was
 
04:30:38.990 --> 04:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
um more than
 
04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
somebody um more than was the subject of
 
04:30:44.109 --> 04:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
a plea
 
04:30:47.630 --> 04:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
bargain uh offer then Pro I mean it
 
04:30:49.149 --> 04:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
 
04:30:51.469 --> 04:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
prosecutors would know that and there
 
04:30:54.630 --> 04:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
would they would adjust their ple
 
04:30:57.790 --> 04:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
bargain offers in uh in in uh to to
 
04:30:59.349 --> 04:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
account for that and the result I
 
04:31:02.590 --> 04:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
suspect would be that uh criminal
 
04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
defendants would not get the benefit of
 
04:31:07.229 --> 04:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
of a plea bargain that they might
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
otherwise get the benefit of uh now um
 
04:31:14.990 --> 04:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
so I I I think I mean I don't think the
 
04:31:17.630 --> 04:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think the idea has any Merit but
 
04:31:20.830 --> 04:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
even if it did have Merit um it you know
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
we certain that certainly hasn't been
 
04:31:24.910 --> 04:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
shown to us by the one witness who
 
04:31:29.070 --> 04:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
offered the offered the uh offered this
 
04:31:33.469 --> 04:31:33.479 align:start position:0%
bill um and and and as he stated had you
 
04:31:36.670 --> 04:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
know sort of has a had a
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh his his interest in doing so was
 
04:31:43.070 --> 04:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
based on a personal experience so I I
 
04:31:48.109 --> 04:31:48.119 align:start position:0%
think it itl is the appropriate U motion
 
04:31:50.349 --> 04:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
here uh anyone else wish to speak
 
04:31:53.670 --> 04:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative HG well it um it it
 
04:31:55.670 --> 04:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
attempts to bind federal judges too
 
04:31:57.309 --> 04:31:57.319 align:start position:0%
which I'm not sure what jurisdiction we
 
04:31:58.710 --> 04:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
have over them and
 
04:32:01.630 --> 04:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
also there may be cases where federal
 
04:32:05.870 --> 04:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
judge might be inclined to uh uh make a
 
04:32:07.990 --> 04:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
less favorable plea par than the state
 
04:32:12.109 --> 04:32:12.119 align:start position:0%
state judge um either because just s the
 
04:32:13.750 --> 04:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
standards with somewh offence are
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
different in those two those two courts
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
or also sometimes you'll have an
 
04:32:19.469 --> 04:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
individual here in New Hampshire who
 
04:32:22.030 --> 04:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
will commit a crime that cross the state
 
04:32:24.149 --> 04:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
lines and obviously if they worked out
 
04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
something with New Hampshire that could
 
04:32:28.030 --> 04:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
only probably could only cover what they
 
04:32:29.630 --> 04:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
did you know that's strictly within the
 
04:32:31.030 --> 04:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
state lines but there could be a
 
04:32:34.149 --> 04:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
parallel federal case that's going to
 
04:32:36.109 --> 04:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
Merit a much higher penalty because the
 
04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
same offender committed similar offenses
 
04:32:43.990 --> 04:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
um in in other states so I think um so I
 
04:32:45.910 --> 04:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
think even if we could do it I don't
 
04:32:47.630 --> 04:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
think it would be a good idea to try to
 
04:32:49.309 --> 04:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
prevent the federal judges from
 
04:32:52.670 --> 04:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
exercising their discretion so all right
 
04:32:55.469 --> 04:32:55.479 align:start position:0%
uh representative Perez on the other
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
hand it could make
 
04:32:57.960 --> 04:32:59.950 align:start position:0%
hand it could make
judges

04:32:59.950 --> 04:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
judges
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
rethink or go along with what a
 
04:33:05.551 --> 04:33:05.561 align:start position:0%
prosecutor may have it could be either
 
04:33:08.109 --> 04:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
change the prosecutor or change the
 
04:33:11.310 --> 04:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
judge I think more and more people are
 
04:33:16.230 --> 04:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
not given or are pressured into not
 
04:33:18.830 --> 04:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
exercising the right of a trial and I
 
04:33:21.910 --> 04:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
find that very sad right other com
 
04:33:21.920 --> 04:33:23.029 align:start position:0%
find that very sad right other com
representative

04:33:23.029 --> 04:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:25.830 --> 04:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
Stapleton yeah I I think this case
 
04:33:28.869 --> 04:33:28.879 align:start position:0%
getting too far into the weeds which we
 
04:33:32.150 --> 04:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't really be doing but I got a
 
04:33:35.869 --> 04:33:35.879 align:start position:0%
question is there does a person have a
 
04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
right of appeal on the
 
04:33:45.349 --> 04:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
sentencing it well it I mean in in state
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
in the in the state court
 
04:33:48.959 --> 04:33:50.470 align:start position:0%
in the in the state court
practice

04:33:50.470 --> 04:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
practice
 
04:33:54.070 --> 04:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:33:56.789 --> 04:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
the the general answer to that is no
 
04:33:58.789 --> 04:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
because it is agreed upon in other words
 
04:34:00.830 --> 04:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
if the
 
04:34:03.429 --> 04:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
the there's a big difference between I
 
04:34:05.551 --> 04:34:05.561 align:start position:0%
think this may be part of there's a big
 
04:34:07.670 --> 04:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
between state and federal in state
 
04:34:09.949 --> 04:34:09.959 align:start position:0%
practice a plea
 
04:34:12.349 --> 04:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
bargain means that the parties have
 
04:34:14.349 --> 04:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
agreed to the plea
 
04:34:16.949 --> 04:34:16.959 align:start position:0%
bargain and the
 
04:34:20.510 --> 04:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
judge H if if the judge either accepts
 
04:34:23.830 --> 04:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
The Plea or rejects it but what the
 
04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
judge can't do is accept the plea and
 
04:34:31.949 --> 04:34:31.959 align:start position:0%
then impose a harsher sentence with one
 
04:34:34.230 --> 04:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
caveat there is what is called in the
 
04:34:38.709 --> 04:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
system a cap plea which means that for
 
04:34:41.390 --> 04:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
example the the parties can
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
agree that the that the um that the
 
04:34:48.390 --> 04:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
maximum that the judge can can impose
 
04:34:50.349 --> 04:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
for example if he accepts this plea is
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
let's say 10 years in prison but the
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
defendant reserves his right to argue
 
04:34:57.830 --> 04:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
for Less um but the defendant knows that
 
04:34:59.990 --> 04:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
he is exposed
 
04:35:03.429 --> 04:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
to the the a maximum of 10 years even
 
04:35:05.070 --> 04:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
though the statute might say the maximum
 
04:35:07.789 --> 04:35:07.799 align:start position:0%
of 15 years the parties have agreed uh
 
04:35:10.590 --> 04:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
to the cap and and if the judge wants to
 
04:35:12.789 --> 04:35:12.799 align:start position:0%
accept that plea he is bound by that
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
agreement in the federal system it is
 
04:35:20.910 --> 04:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
considerably different um the the judge
 
04:35:25.510 --> 04:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
with some exceptions but generally the
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
judge whether there's a plea or not
 
04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
retains the right to impose the sentence
 
04:35:32.949 --> 04:35:32.959 align:start position:0%
that within the limits of the law that
 
04:35:35.910 --> 04:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
the judge feels is appropriate so there
 
04:35:38.910 --> 04:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
there's more of a risk in the federal
 
04:35:41.390 --> 04:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
system than there is in the in the state
 
04:35:42.910 --> 04:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
system and I I don't know that any of
 
04:35:45.189 --> 04:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
the details of this person's agreement
 
04:35:47.470 --> 04:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
but I think you know that may well
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
explain what what happened in his case I
 
04:35:51.949 --> 04:35:51.959 align:start position:0%
don't know but that so that case was a
 
04:35:54.029 --> 04:35:54.039 align:start position:0%
federal it was a federal case yes it was
 
04:35:56.910 --> 04:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
a federal case Okay representative tur
 
04:35:59.830 --> 04:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
yeah just one quick comment I I I don't
 
04:36:01.470 --> 04:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
feel that this legislation should go
 
04:36:05.470 --> 04:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
forward but uh I did sort of want to and
 
04:36:06.869 --> 04:36:06.879 align:start position:0%
I think maybe in a couple of comments
 
04:36:09.310 --> 04:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
around the table it did feel like at at
 
04:36:12.670 --> 04:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
its core the question of whether or not
 
04:36:15.750 --> 04:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
huge differential um potential sentences
 
04:36:18.109 --> 04:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
between standard sentencing versus what
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
a plea can go down to does have the
 
04:36:23.869 --> 04:36:23.879 align:start position:0%
potential to to at some level thwart
 
04:36:28.629 --> 04:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
people's you know ability to to to seek
 
04:36:31.230 --> 04:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
you know a trial so yeah no I I I I mean
 
04:36:33.349 --> 04:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
I do age I agree at some point I think
 
04:36:35.510 --> 04:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's probably that that probably is
 
04:36:37.949 --> 04:36:37.959 align:start position:0%
true and I think you know
 
04:36:41.150 --> 04:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
most hopefully most judges would take
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
that you know they might in other words
 
04:36:45.629 --> 04:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
I think it probably there is an
 
04:36:48.109 --> 04:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
Institutional interest
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
in resolving cases that make it
 
04:36:54.189 --> 04:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate I think for the system to
 
04:36:56.910 --> 04:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
offer a reward to somebody who is
 
04:36:58.629 --> 04:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
willing to accept responsibility and
 
04:37:01.230 --> 04:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
avoid a trial and all that but there I
 
04:37:02.910 --> 04:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
agree that there is a limit to that it
 
04:37:07.150 --> 04:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
can't you know it it it shouldn't
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
be like you know a Hu just a huge Hammer
 
04:37:13.390 --> 04:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
um and and sometimes I think it probably
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
is uh particularly in the federal system
 
04:37:19.269 --> 04:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
but anyway um all right are we ready uh
 
04:37:23.230 --> 04:37:23.240 align:start position:0%

seconds um representative Alexander you
 
04:38:51.789 --> 04:38:51.799 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your motion yeah I I
 
04:38:54.189 --> 04:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
think still this being my bill I think
 
04:38:56.070 --> 04:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Merit to this bill I
 
04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
think that um when when speaking about
 
04:39:00.629 --> 04:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
housing issues it's important to make
 
04:39:02.310 --> 04:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
sure state agencies understand that
 
04:39:02.320 --> 04:39:03.390 align:start position:0%
sure state agencies understand that
housing

04:39:03.390 --> 04:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:39:05.990 --> 04:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
is per the citizens of New Hampshire one
 
04:39:08.109 --> 04:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
of the biggest problems facing our state
 
04:39:11.910 --> 04:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to see um this become a
 
04:39:14.429 --> 04:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
true interm study where the members of
 
04:39:16.029 --> 04:39:16.039 align:start position:0%
this committee that would like to join
 
04:39:18.310 --> 04:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
me and look into how state agencies are
 
04:39:20.429 --> 04:39:20.439 align:start position:0%
dealing with permits related to housing
 
04:39:23.709 --> 04:39:23.719 align:start position:0%
in particular um in other rulings they
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
would join me in a nice summer recess um
 
04:39:29.230 --> 04:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
into this committee room and we can look
 
04:39:31.551 --> 04:39:31.561 align:start position:0%
into that I spoke with Dees and they
 
04:39:32.949 --> 04:39:32.959 align:start position:0%
indicated there's a lot of things that
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing on the rues side to
 
04:39:39.070 --> 04:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
expedite some of these um permits um you
 
04:39:40.708 --> 04:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
know they think there's a simple rule
 
04:39:43.350 --> 04:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
change they can make to move not just
 
04:39:46.990 --> 04:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
the workforce housing um permits to the
 
04:39:48.390 --> 04:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
top of the pile which is already allowed
 
04:39:50.910 --> 04:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
under RSA but all housing permits to the
 
04:39:52.190 --> 04:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
top of the pile because I believe
 
04:39:54.150 --> 04:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
strongly if we are increasing the supply
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
of housing it doesn't matter what the
 
04:39:58.070 --> 04:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
housing is if we get it built it'll help
 
04:39:59.948 --> 04:39:59.958 align:start position:0%
lower the price for everybody so I hope
 
04:40:02.670 --> 04:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
that you'll um at least support me and
 
04:40:04.590 --> 04:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be a part of this but
 
04:40:06.628 --> 04:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
um at least allow me the opportunity to
 
04:40:10.948 --> 04:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
study this more thank you any other uh
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%

for a motion thank you Mr chair um I
 
04:41:16.190 --> 04:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that um I would like
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.638 --> 04:41:50.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:41:50.190 --> 04:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
represent could I just ask are you
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
passing it out just for discussion or I
 
04:41:55.708 --> 04:41:55.718 align:start position:0%
I was under the impression there was
 
04:41:57.788 --> 04:41:57.798 align:start position:0%
going to be an i an interim study mode
 
04:42:01.510 --> 04:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
yes I am g i i but I wanted to have to
 
04:42:02.948 --> 04:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
have have the amendment and see the
 
04:42:04.990 --> 04:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
amendment but yes I am going to move
 
04:42:08.550 --> 04:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
interim study this is a bill which um
 
04:42:11.708 --> 04:42:11.718 align:start position:0%
and with the amendment which allows in
 
04:42:16.430 --> 04:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
um Dees cases uh once it has gone
 
04:42:20.788 --> 04:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
through um a hearing with the you may
 
04:42:24.070 --> 04:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
remember there are four special councils
 
04:42:27.788 --> 04:42:27.798 align:start position:0%
in Dees that hear appeals and then after
 
04:42:30.470 --> 04:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
that the only appeal would be to the New
 
04:42:33.390 --> 04:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court and the gist of
 
04:42:35.948 --> 04:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
this amendment is that it would
 
04:42:38.910 --> 04:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
allow um a complainant
 
04:42:42.868 --> 04:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
to the situation that arises is the um
 
04:42:45.390 --> 04:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
is the science is overcoming is
 
04:42:49.150 --> 04:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
developing faster than the um than the
 
04:42:51.670 --> 04:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
Appellate process and so in order to be
 
04:42:54.750 --> 04:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
able to open up the acceptance of new
 
04:42:58.750 --> 04:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
evidence um this amendment allows the
 
04:43:01.150 --> 04:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
complaintant to file a complaint with
 
04:43:02.430 --> 04:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
the Superior
 
04:43:05.390 --> 04:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
Court however um in thinking about the
 
04:43:07.390 --> 04:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
bill further and in talking with other
 
04:43:11.670 --> 04:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
people it became clear that this um
 
04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
applies across the board to any number
 
04:43:18.350 --> 04:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
of administrative agencies and so the
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
question becomes whether this should be
 
04:43:23.830 --> 04:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
broader than just Dees and why have we
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
singled out Dees in particular and so
 
04:43:29.788 --> 04:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
I'm moving inm study so that we can look
 
04:43:32.830 --> 04:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
at the broader issues and can consider
 
04:43:36.628 --> 04:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
whether um we should be looking at other
 
04:43:38.708 --> 04:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
um the broader
 
04:43:41.830 --> 04:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
totality um and so that's why I'm moving
 
04:43:43.030 --> 04:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
in term study all right is there a
 
04:43:45.310 --> 04:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
second on the motion for study seconded
 
04:43:47.750 --> 04:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
by representative Alexander um
 
04:43:49.030 --> 04:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander did you want to
 
04:43:51.390 --> 04:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
speak at so you know what I I I think
 
04:43:53.390 --> 04:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
I'm completely in support of the interim
 
04:43:57.310 --> 04:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
study the only thing that I would ask um
 
04:43:58.750 --> 04:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
the people that are going to be involved
 
04:44:01.628 --> 04:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
in the interim study on both of these uh
 
04:44:04.510 --> 04:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
1602 and this and and if you want me to
 
04:44:07.270 --> 04:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to you know spend at least
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
devote at least some of my summer to
 
04:44:11.230 --> 04:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
working on this not not the majority but
 
04:44:14.190 --> 04:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
some um the only thing I'd ask you to uh
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
think about is to be sure
 
04:44:20.470 --> 04:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
that the the idea of move of of
 
04:44:23.110 --> 04:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
streamlining the process I think is
 
04:44:24.310 --> 04:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
particularly important for the reasons
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
that Al just uh representative Alexander
 
04:44:27.360 --> 04:44:29.310 align:start position:0%
that Al just uh representative Alexander
mentioned

04:44:29.310 --> 04:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
um I think you need to be careful though
 
04:44:35.390 --> 04:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
that in doing that you don't create like
 
04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
another level of I mean for example this
 
04:44:39.150 --> 04:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment that you just discussed
 
04:44:40.750 --> 04:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative Manos it might be it
 
04:44:43.270 --> 04:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
might be good but it does create another
 
04:44:45.628 --> 04:44:45.638 align:start position:0%
another level of review which might mean
 
04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
that things get slowed down so just
 
04:44:49.590 --> 04:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
something to think about as you're as
 
04:44:52.750 --> 04:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
you're doing it but the motion is um uh
 
04:44:54.788 --> 04:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
interim study uh anybody have anything
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
further they want to say on that all
 
04:44:58.190 --> 04:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
right then I'd ask the clerk to call the
 
04:44:58.200 --> 04:44:59.788 align:start position:0%
right then I'd ask the clerk to call the

legislate is there a
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%

Alexandri would you like to speak to
 
04:46:13.390 --> 04:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
your motion yes yes briefly um this is
 
04:46:16.270 --> 04:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
one of these bills that um has come up I
 
04:46:17.708 --> 04:46:17.718 align:start position:0%
believe six out of the six years I've
 
04:46:20.270 --> 04:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
been on this committee um we've we
 
04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
looked at similar legislation last year
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
as well I think there's things that this
 
04:46:27.230 --> 04:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
bill similar to the last year still do
 
04:46:30.750 --> 04:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
not solve language wise um first of all
 
04:46:32.910 --> 04:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
um this would create a cause of action
 
04:46:35.390 --> 04:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
through a violation of um the con State
 
04:46:37.070 --> 04:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Constitution or Federal
 
04:46:40.270 --> 04:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution um there's there's really
 
04:46:42.868 --> 04:46:42.878 align:start position:0%
no standard on negligence so if any
 
04:46:45.708 --> 04:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
employee violates a right um whether
 
04:46:47.590 --> 04:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
they did it intentionally or not the
 
04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
state is held liable this is going to
 
04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
open up the flood gates to lawsuits to
 
04:46:54.628 --> 04:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities um additionally I asked
 
04:46:56.190 --> 04:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
the question during the public hearing
 
04:46:58.190 --> 04:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
about um the new Constitutional
 
04:46:59.948 --> 04:46:59.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment regarding right to privacy
 
04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's now a constitutional amendment
 
04:47:04.830 --> 04:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
per the voters in the 2018 election so I
 
04:47:07.590 --> 04:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
I asked if 91a would follow under that
 
04:47:09.628 --> 04:47:09.638 align:start position:0%
um you know and the attorney said yes I
 
04:47:12.510 --> 04:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
I have a real problem over um I
 
04:47:14.470 --> 04:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
understand 91a should not be violated
 
04:47:16.230 --> 04:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
but this would open up um a ton of
 
04:47:20.110 --> 04:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuits on if a if a town intentionally
 
04:47:22.708 --> 04:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
or unintentionally violated 91a um this
 
04:47:25.590 --> 04:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
would open up this lawsuit so um there's
 
04:47:28.270 --> 04:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
already Immunity on the books for when
 
04:47:31.070 --> 04:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
an individual uh acts in a wanting or
 
04:47:33.150 --> 04:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
Reckless way um and that's clearly
 
04:47:36.030 --> 04:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
defined in in case law so um for that
 
04:47:37.868 --> 04:47:37.878 align:start position:0%
reason I think that we should continue
 
04:47:40.948 --> 04:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
the tradition of um trusting that most
 
04:47:43.390 --> 04:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
employees um most government officials
 
04:47:47.948 --> 04:47:47.958 align:start position:0%
act in a um decent and um positive way
 
04:47:49.430 --> 04:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
and we should trust that we continue to
 
04:47:51.470 --> 04:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
do that while also holding the ones that
 
04:47:53.788 --> 04:47:53.798 align:start position:0%
do not accountable and making sure we're
 
04:47:55.750 --> 04:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
training all of our employees correctly
 
04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
so that's it any other anyone else wish
 
04:48:02.070 --> 04:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
to be heard on uh House Bill
 
04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%

it thank you Mr chair members of
 
04:50:52.510 --> 04:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
Judiciary during the public testimony on
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
this bill there was lots of questions
 
04:50:57.510 --> 04:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
regarding when does Discovery start what
 
04:50:59.350 --> 04:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
triggers Discovery in a medical
 
04:51:01.110 --> 04:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
malpractice suit there was also
 
04:51:04.548 --> 04:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
questions relative to the length of time
 
04:51:07.708 --> 04:51:07.718 align:start position:0%
that a person undergoing a d transition
 
04:51:10.708 --> 04:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
treatment could have access to medical
 
04:51:12.990 --> 04:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
malpractice liability standards those
 
04:51:15.788 --> 04:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
causes of action are already in statute
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
today there's a three-year time limit
 
04:51:20.310 --> 04:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
there's a beginning of the discovery
 
04:51:22.510 --> 04:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
window when the when the patient
 
04:51:24.510 --> 04:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
realizes harm was done that's when the
 
04:51:26.868 --> 04:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
clock starts ticking this amendment
 
04:51:28.750 --> 04:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
adopts the language that is in the
 
04:51:30.868 --> 04:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
Senate version Senate Bill
 
04:51:34.110 --> 04:51:34.120 align:start position:0%
304 that is the beginning of that
 
04:51:36.548 --> 04:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
Discovery window happens when the person
 
04:51:39.150 --> 04:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
begins a d transition that would be like
 
04:51:41.070 --> 04:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
some action whether they saw another
 
04:51:42.830 --> 04:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
doctor and and did something different
 
04:51:45.150 --> 04:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
whether they discontinued taking certain
 
04:51:49.830 --> 04:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
medications or whether they
 
04:51:53.470 --> 04:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
um um started taking in the case of
 
04:51:55.788 --> 04:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
taking hormones they went from taking
 
04:51:58.150 --> 04:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
estrogen back to testosterone or vice
 
04:51:59.708 --> 04:51:59.718 align:start position:0%
versa so at that point there's a
 
04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
positive action on the part of the of
 
04:52:04.590 --> 04:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
the patient and that makes an easy time
 
04:52:07.708 --> 04:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
zero so this just clarifies where in the
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
law um a transition a d transition would
 
04:52:14.070 --> 04:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
have access to any medical malpractice
 
04:52:18.390 --> 04:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you um all right uh any
 
04:52:21.990 --> 04:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to uh be heard on this
 
04:52:24.910 --> 04:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative
 
04:52:29.590 --> 04:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
Perez so I have a acquaintance who has a
 
04:52:31.230 --> 04:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
child that is
 
04:52:33.310 --> 04:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
detransitioning and I think we have
 
04:52:38.030 --> 04:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
worked very hard to make
 
04:52:42.708 --> 04:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
um to attempt to and to make some um
 
04:52:45.868 --> 04:52:45.878 align:start position:0%
laws for people transitioning and I real
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
feel very strongly that we have really
 
04:52:52.510 --> 04:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
no guide guidance or
 
04:52:56.390 --> 04:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
no support or anything for those that
 
04:52:56.400 --> 04:52:57.110 align:start position:0%
no support or anything for those that
are

04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:53:00.750 --> 04:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
detransitioning and there are thousands
 
04:53:04.030 --> 04:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
and thousands and thousands of uh
 
04:53:06.708 --> 04:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
individuals that are attempting to undo
 
04:53:09.070 --> 04:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
what they feel they did wrong to
 
04:53:12.990 --> 04:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
themselves and or was done wrong to them
 
04:53:16.548 --> 04:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
and I think we need a way to allow them
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
to have a back end to fight um for what
 
04:53:24.390 --> 04:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
was done to them so I feel very strongly
 
04:53:26.830 --> 04:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
that this by the amendment I didn't like
 
04:53:30.270 --> 04:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
the age 18 20 years and all this stuff
 
04:53:31.708 --> 04:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
but I think this
 
04:53:35.150 --> 04:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
amendment does support support
 
04:53:37.590 --> 04:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
detransitioning individuals who also
 
04:53:38.910 --> 04:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
right all right other anyone else wish
 
04:53:44.510 --> 04:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
to be heard on this yes representative
 
04:53:47.430 --> 04:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
kab thank you Mr
 
04:53:50.430 --> 04:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I guess it it still troubles me
 
04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
in this amendment that somebody a
 
04:53:54.310 --> 04:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
50-year-old who chooses to take
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
medication to transition could then go
 
04:54:00.270 --> 04:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
and a doctor because they changed their
 
04:54:04.190 --> 04:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
mind about it and I just
 
04:54:05.788 --> 04:54:05.798 align:start position:0%
if an adult makes a decision of their
 
04:54:07.628 --> 04:54:07.638 align:start position:0%
own free will why aren't they liable for
 
04:54:09.548 --> 04:54:09.558 align:start position:0%
it why is the doctor doctor liable for
 
04:54:10.948 --> 04:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
it I just don't even this concept
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense to me so for that
 
04:54:14.310 --> 04:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
reason I'll be voting against it thank
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%

04:54:18.830 --> 04:54:18.840 align:start position:0%

through this um do representative press
 
04:54:30.190 --> 04:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
do you mean in New Hampshire or
 
04:54:31.150 --> 04:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the
 
04:54:33.270 --> 04:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
country I mean throughout the country
 
04:54:36.190 --> 04:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
but there are many here too if you um go
 
04:54:38.788 --> 04:54:38.798 align:start position:0%
on to if you are allowed to go on to
 
04:54:40.750 --> 04:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
some of the detransitioning which I had
 
04:54:43.230 --> 04:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
authorization by an individual
 
04:54:45.390 --> 04:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
detransitioning to go they have a
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
support group and there are a lot of
 
04:54:50.190 --> 04:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
young individuals from New Hampshire
 
04:54:53.110 --> 04:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
that are attempting to d d transition go
 
04:54:54.990 --> 04:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
follow up please of course yeah just so
 
04:54:56.590 --> 04:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
that I can get an idea of the scope of
 
04:54:58.230 --> 04:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
the number in New Hampshire what do you
 
04:55:00.430 --> 04:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
have um for a number in New Hampshire or
 
04:55:03.150 --> 04:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
people detransitioning thank you I don't
 
04:55:05.190 --> 04:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
have number but I think we need to
 
04:55:07.510 --> 04:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
protect people even if it's one just
 
04:55:09.670 --> 04:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
like we need to protect children even if
 
04:55:09.680 --> 04:55:10.548 align:start position:0%
like we need to protect children even if
it's

04:55:10.548 --> 04:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:55:12.750 --> 04:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
one other
 
04:55:15.190 --> 04:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
comments um all right so I guess what I
 
04:55:17.350 --> 04:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
the only the only thing that I would say
 
04:55:18.868 --> 04:55:18.878 align:start position:0%
about this is I told this to
 
04:55:21.150 --> 04:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
representative who is
 
04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I voted in favor and I know many
 
04:55:25.548 --> 04:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
people on this committee did not but I
 
04:55:27.030 --> 04:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
voted in favor and I think a number of
 
04:55:28.548 --> 04:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
people on the committee also voted in
 
04:55:31.230 --> 04:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill we recently passed uh
 
04:55:34.548 --> 04:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
to prohibit uh trans just
 
04:55:38.590 --> 04:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
transitioning surgery for miners um
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
personally I would if I would be be
 
04:55:45.868 --> 04:55:45.878 align:start position:0%
amenable I I guess I want to see exactly
 
04:55:47.708 --> 04:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
what was proposed but I would be
 
04:55:51.510 --> 04:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
amenable to Banning for miners um even
 
04:55:51.520 --> 04:55:53.150 align:start position:0%
amenable to Banning for miners um even
non-surgical

04:55:53.150 --> 04:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
non-surgical
 
04:55:53.160 --> 04:55:55.270 align:start position:0%
non-surgical
transitioning

04:55:55.270 --> 04:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
transitioning
 
04:55:57.948 --> 04:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
um but this the problem I have with this
 
04:56:02.750 --> 04:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
bill is it that it would basically say
 
04:56:04.030 --> 04:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
even though
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
that may even though nonsurgical or or
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
at least right now even surgical
 
04:56:12.070 --> 04:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
transitioning of minors is legal we're
 
04:56:14.390 --> 04:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
somehow going to be able to go after the
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
doctors um so or somebody's going to be
 
04:56:20.830 --> 04:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
able to go after the doctors way later
 
04:56:23.430 --> 04:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
on the analogy I drew to representative
 
04:56:25.150 --> 04:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
Hol and I think it applies is that's
 
04:56:27.708 --> 04:56:27.718 align:start position:0%
like saying you know the we're going to
 
04:56:30.150 --> 04:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
go after the Firearms manufacturers
 
04:56:32.110 --> 04:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
because somebody shot somebody with a
 
04:56:35.310 --> 04:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
gun um that it's that that it's not the
 
04:56:37.868 --> 04:56:37.878 align:start position:0%
person that that made the decision to do
 
04:56:39.990 --> 04:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
that it's GNA it's the it's the big bad
 
04:56:42.788 --> 04:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
Firearms manufacturers I don't support
 
04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
that and I can't support this um so
 
04:56:47.708 --> 04:56:47.718 align:start position:0%
anyway other
 
04:56:50.670 --> 04:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
comments all right um I guess then we're
 
04:56:53.830 --> 04:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
ready for a vote the the vote is on the
 
04:56:57.470 --> 04:56:57.480 align:start position:0%

main bill um representative Alexander do
 
04:58:19.190 --> 04:58:19.200 align:start position:0%

don't not okay all right um is there any
 
04:58:22.080 --> 04:58:25.270 align:start position:0%
don't not okay all right um is there any

04:58:29.910 --> 04:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
motion I to pass all right uh motion is

04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
second right second by representative uh
 
04:58:36.718 --> 04:58:38.390 align:start position:0%
second right second by representative uh
gon

04:58:38.390 --> 04:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
gon
 
04:58:41.110 --> 04:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
um and representative Perez you wish to
 
04:58:44.670 --> 04:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
speak to your uh
 
04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
motion we need to start something to
 
04:58:49.750 --> 04:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
help those
 
04:58:52.708 --> 04:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
who feel that
 
04:58:52.718 --> 04:58:54.470 align:start position:0%
who feel that
they

04:58:54.470 --> 04:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:58:57.628 --> 04:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
were made decisions were forc or pushed
 
04:59:00.548 --> 04:59:00.558 align:start position:0%
or coerced into making that seems to be
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
a big word right now coerced into making
 
04:59:07.948 --> 04:59:07.958 align:start position:0%
decisions that they later regretted and
 
04:59:10.750 --> 04:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
I think we need to start helping them
 
04:59:14.070 --> 04:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
and again as is said so many times today
 
04:59:16.390 --> 04:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
if the bill is imperfect we can ask the
 
04:59:19.910 --> 04:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
legislators to change it later all right
 
04:59:23.030 --> 04:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
any other anyone else representative
 
04:59:26.510 --> 04:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
gon I wonder why we sneer at the idea
 
04:59:28.910 --> 04:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
that somebody would change their
 
04:59:31.470 --> 04:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
mind we we think going from male to
 
04:59:34.750 --> 04:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
female or female to to male you're born
 
04:59:36.830 --> 04:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
biologically male and you be want to
 
04:59:38.150 --> 04:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
transition to
 
04:59:40.270 --> 04:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
female but somehow or another it's
 
04:59:42.070 --> 04:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
different than if you wanted to go back
 
04:59:44.750 --> 04:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
to being male from being female that
 
04:59:46.750 --> 04:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
somehow or another that's not possible
 
04:59:48.910 --> 04:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
or that's ridiculous nobody wants to do
 
04:59:50.830 --> 04:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
that or there should not be any
 
04:59:52.868 --> 04:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
protections similar to going from one to
 
04:59:54.190 --> 04:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
the other you're not allowed to change
 
04:59:56.708 --> 04:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
your mind is what it sounds like to
 
05:00:00.070 --> 05:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
me and I do believe that a lot of people
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
are caught up in a world of confusion
 
05:00:07.670 --> 05:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
and there's pressure to conform to
 
05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
things that maybe they don't really want
 
05:00:10.430 --> 05:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
to conform to but they're not sure what
 
05:00:13.150 --> 05:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
they want to do and so they're making
 
05:00:15.990 --> 05:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
decisions that have long lasting effects
 
05:00:16.000 --> 05:00:16.868 align:start position:0%
decisions that have long lasting effects
they're

05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:00:19.708 --> 05:00:19.718 align:start position:0%
irreversible severe consequences to it
 
05:00:21.750 --> 05:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
and there just needs to be a measure
 
05:00:24.590 --> 05:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
involved to try to protect those people
 
05:00:27.470 --> 05:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
who said wow I think I've gone too far
 
05:00:30.948 --> 05:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
in this I got to try to go back to some
 
05:00:33.910 --> 05:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
semblance of sanity
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
other comments representative
 
05:00:40.548 --> 05:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
kutab so I would absolutely agree if
 
05:00:41.990 --> 05:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
somebody transitioned and they want to
 
05:00:43.430 --> 05:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
go back they should absolutely be able
 
05:00:47.910 --> 05:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
to do so I just I don't feel that if you
 
05:00:50.310 --> 05:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
used inform consent to consent to taking
 
05:00:51.948 --> 05:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
medications and chose to take the
 
05:00:53.590 --> 05:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
medications that the doctor should be
 
05:00:55.390 --> 05:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
liable that you changed your mind I
 
05:00:57.110 --> 05:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
guess that's the part that I'm kind of
 
05:00:59.590 --> 05:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
hung up on and again like this bill
 
05:01:01.548 --> 05:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't just apply to to miners either
 
05:01:04.390 --> 05:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
it applies to a yearold chooses to take
 
05:01:06.390 --> 05:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
the medication when they're 50 and then
 
05:01:08.190 --> 05:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
they change their mind when they're 60 I
 
05:01:10.430 --> 05:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
just I'm not sure why a doctor should be
 
05:01:10.440 --> 05:01:11.510 align:start position:0%
just I'm not sure why a doctor should be
liable

05:01:11.510 --> 05:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
liable
 
05:01:14.030 --> 05:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
for a patient changing their mind after
 
05:01:15.670 --> 05:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
they've given informed consent that's
 
05:01:18.310 --> 05:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
that to me that's would be a similar
 
05:01:21.310 --> 05:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
concept to if a man chose to have a
 
05:01:22.990 --> 05:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
vasectomy or a woman chose to have her
 
05:01:24.590 --> 05:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
tubes tied and then they changed their
 
05:01:26.750 --> 05:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
mind we're going to now say that the
 
05:01:29.150 --> 05:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
doctor civil liable
 
05:01:31.910 --> 05:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
that the patient changed their mind I
 
05:01:34.350 --> 05:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
just I guess that's a part that I don't
 
05:01:36.110 --> 05:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to me thank you
 
05:01:36.120 --> 05:01:37.190 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to me thank you
representative

05:01:37.190 --> 05:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:01:40.350 --> 05:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
Stapleton yeah thank you Mr chair
 
05:01:44.708 --> 05:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
um cultural pressure peer
 
05:01:48.150 --> 05:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
pressure um just the ongoing way our
 
05:01:50.470 --> 05:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
society has
 
05:01:54.190 --> 05:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
transitioned um is almost
 
05:01:59.708 --> 05:01:59.718 align:start position:0%
uh a difficult Force for young people to
 
05:02:03.470 --> 05:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
resist um did we have any test testimony
 
05:02:06.230 --> 05:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
that this kind of bill passed in
 
05:02:08.708 --> 05:02:08.718 align:start position:0%
Virginia and had a great chilling effect
 
05:02:12.430 --> 05:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
upon transitional surgeries and or am I
 
05:02:14.070 --> 05:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
thinking of another I think I think I
 
05:02:16.628 --> 05:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
think it was Missouri not Virginia if I
 
05:02:18.350 --> 05:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
recall correctly I think that I thought
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's what representative po had told
 
05:02:24.230 --> 05:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
me that was Missouri that passed it
 
05:02:26.030 --> 05:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay no it's all right I don't think it
 
05:02:28.230 --> 05:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
makes much I I was wondering if this
 
05:02:32.548 --> 05:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
bill was based on that Virginia Missouri
 
05:02:35.310 --> 05:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
or what whatever that's yeah I think it
 
05:02:38.470 --> 05:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
was I think it was based on some
 
05:02:41.470 --> 05:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
other no no I just I mean it was some
 
05:02:43.830 --> 05:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
other I think it was some other state as
 
05:02:43.840 --> 05:02:45.628 align:start position:0%
other I think it was some other state as
I

05:02:45.628 --> 05:02:45.638 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:02:50.070 --> 05:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
understand so Tim oh yes representative
 
05:02:53.510 --> 05:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
Oregon yes I'm trying to wrap my head
 
05:02:55.390 --> 05:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
around the idea that large numbers of
 
05:02:58.990 --> 05:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
people are being coerced to go into a
 
05:03:01.030 --> 05:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
gender transition which in spite of what
 
05:03:02.430 --> 05:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
some people believe is really one of the
 
05:03:04.270 --> 05:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
most difficult things a person can do
 
05:03:06.070 --> 05:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
and is something that
 
05:03:09.510 --> 05:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
um I just and also I just don't
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
understand why how you could C someone
 
05:03:14.350 --> 05:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
into doing something that difficult
 
05:03:15.830 --> 05:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
unless the person who was doing the
 
05:03:17.230 --> 05:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
transitioning was pretty highly
 
05:03:20.708 --> 05:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
motivated to to do it especially given
 
05:03:23.788 --> 05:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
that um just about everything in our
 
05:03:25.708 --> 05:03:25.718 align:start position:0%
society most other societ is very
 
05:03:27.948 --> 05:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
divided into male and females so I think
 
05:03:29.910 --> 05:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
if somebody's Crossing that line and
 
05:03:33.548 --> 05:03:33.558 align:start position:0%
then would always sort of be at
 
05:03:35.590 --> 05:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
least I'm not sure why somebody would
 
05:03:37.628 --> 05:03:37.638 align:start position:0%
cross that line unless they really
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
really deeply felt that they they wanted
 
05:03:42.548 --> 05:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
they wanted to so I just don't exactly
 
05:03:43.868 --> 05:03:43.878 align:start position:0%
know what these people are supposed toly
 
05:03:45.830 --> 05:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
coursing young people into changing
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
their gender what they're gaining from
 
05:03:50.150 --> 05:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
it so it seems me the social pressure is
 
05:03:54.070 --> 05:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
all the other way to stay in the same uh
 
05:03:55.868 --> 05:03:55.878 align:start position:0%
gender to which you were assigned at at
 
05:03:58.510 --> 05:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
at Birth and um I might also start a
 
05:04:01.910 --> 05:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
question the idea of biological sex is
 
05:04:04.390 --> 05:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
more Central than your gender identity
 
05:04:07.070 --> 05:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
unless I think like what what you
 
05:04:09.670 --> 05:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
believe yourself to be is more important
 
05:04:10.990 --> 05:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
than what you present as and way you
 
05:04:12.270 --> 05:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
present on is obviously much more
 
05:04:14.670 --> 05:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
important than like so-called biological
 
05:04:16.910 --> 05:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
things you like you especially you know
 
05:04:19.350 --> 05:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
the X and Y chromosomes which we can't
 
05:04:21.230 --> 05:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
even see and we and which were only
 
05:04:22.708 --> 05:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
discovered in the last century or so
 
05:04:25.430 --> 05:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
long before people had the concept of
 
05:04:27.110 --> 05:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
male and female which they voice that so
 
05:04:29.670 --> 05:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
I just don't quite
 
05:04:31.750 --> 05:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
understand how you can successfully
 
05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
course someone into changing their
 
05:04:36.030 --> 05:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
changing their their gender unless they
 
05:04:37.310 --> 05:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
unless the person who is doing the
 
05:04:39.868 --> 05:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
changing really strongly felt that they
 
05:04:42.430 --> 05:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to do it so all right other
 
05:04:44.708 --> 05:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
representative D Lorenzo thank you Mr
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
chair not withstanding this
 
05:04:52.548 --> 05:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
bill people who are medically injured
 
05:04:54.990 --> 05:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
have a right
 
05:04:58.708 --> 05:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
um to damages recover damages um on
 
05:05:01.750 --> 05:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
account of medical injury uh and that's
 
05:05:04.390 --> 05:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
based in talk to IT contract law or
 
05:05:09.910 --> 05:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise so if we take out the um
 
05:05:13.310 --> 05:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
transitional aspect of this bill it's
 
05:05:15.910 --> 05:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
still on its face if a person is injured
 
05:05:18.788 --> 05:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
medically injured they um are entitled
 
05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
to damages period no matter what the um
 
05:05:24.830 --> 05:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
procedure is thank you right other
 
05:05:27.430 --> 05:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative fore first of all
 
05:05:31.948 --> 05:05:31.958 align:start position:0%
children do not have a right an ability
 
05:05:36.590 --> 05:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
Maybe to give informed consent so it is
 
05:05:39.310 --> 05:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
not them that are giving the informed
 
05:05:39.320 --> 05:05:42.110 align:start position:0%
not them that are giving the informed
consent

05:05:42.110 --> 05:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
consent
 
05:05:44.110 --> 05:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
secondly I know you're not going to like
 
05:05:46.868 --> 05:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
this but we just passed to go to the
 
05:05:49.548 --> 05:05:49.558 align:start position:0%
house a bill that everybody has said
 
05:05:51.628 --> 05:05:51.638 align:start position:0%
it's only going to be a few people very
 
05:05:53.470 --> 05:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
rare very rare that are going to want to
 
05:05:56.788 --> 05:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
have medical assisted termination of
 
05:06:01.590 --> 05:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
life but yet we are talking about people
 
05:06:03.470 --> 05:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
who need to
 
05:06:06.548 --> 05:06:06.558 align:start position:0%
protected mostly people who had this
 
05:06:11.070 --> 05:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
done as children as un
 
05:06:15.230 --> 05:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
non-adults from being offered some
 
05:06:17.868 --> 05:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
protection to write a wrong that they
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
feel was done to them I I it's
 
05:06:24.430 --> 05:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
mindboggling to me that we can sit here
 
05:06:26.510 --> 05:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
on one hand and say one thing and sit
 
05:06:28.350 --> 05:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
here on another hand and say another
 
05:06:32.590 --> 05:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
thing it's like this is real and I'll do
 
05:06:34.910 --> 05:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
respect representative Horgan this is
 
05:06:37.788 --> 05:06:37.798 align:start position:0%
happening every single day planned
 
05:06:41.110 --> 05:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
parenthood is giving out the drugs here
 
05:06:44.510 --> 05:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire every single day and
 
05:06:47.788 --> 05:06:47.798 align:start position:0%
the surgery is being done every single
 
05:06:50.868 --> 05:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
day and in Massachusetts you're paying
 
05:06:54.868 --> 05:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
for the surgery so I mean it is going on
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
these people need to be protected
 
05:07:01.390 --> 05:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
too representative de I'd like to follow
 
05:07:04.270 --> 05:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
up on us representative PR's statements
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
first of all um the surgery is not just
 
05:07:09.070 --> 05:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
for children it's for adults and
 
05:07:12.750 --> 05:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
children all generations secondly um do
 
05:07:14.990 --> 05:07:15.000 align:start position:0%

05:07:17.868 --> 05:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
um inferences about the volume of
 
05:07:19.788 --> 05:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
surgeries that are going on you said in
 
05:07:21.270 --> 05:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Massachusetts do you
 
05:07:23.868 --> 05:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
have any back up on
 
05:07:25.628 --> 05:07:25.638 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
05:07:27.708 --> 05:07:27.718 align:start position:0%

Smith uh thank you I'm I'm I'm following
 
05:07:35.590 --> 05:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
up on representative D Lorenzo's Point
 
05:07:37.230 --> 05:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
could you give me the documentation of
 
05:07:42.750 --> 05:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:44.548 --> 05:07:44.558 align:start position:0%
par Call

Dairy go on theirs and they will say
 
05:07:52.868 --> 05:07:52.878 align:start position:0%
that they offer hormone
 
05:07:57.190 --> 05:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
and transition really yes really or call
 
05:07:58.708 --> 05:07:58.718 align:start position:0%

05:08:05.990 --> 05:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
there right all right um any other
 
05:08:08.590 --> 05:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
comments so I guess I I I I know I'm
 
05:08:11.788 --> 05:08:11.798 align:start position:0%
repeating myself and I apologize but
 
05:08:14.510 --> 05:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
the the problem I have is this as I
 
05:08:17.110 --> 05:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
think representative kab pointed out it
 
05:08:23.190 --> 05:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
this we're saying this is this this is
 
05:08:26.310 --> 05:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
just like the the there was a recent New
 
05:08:27.750 --> 05:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court case that you
 
05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
probably all very very recent dealing
 
05:08:32.270 --> 05:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
with the immunity statute for firearms
 
05:08:35.548 --> 05:08:35.558 align:start position:0%
dealers and under the law the Firearms
 
05:08:39.510 --> 05:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
dealer legally sold the handgun to the I
 
05:08:40.750 --> 05:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
think it was a handgun or whatever it
 
05:08:43.390 --> 05:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
was uh to the person who shot the police
 
05:08:45.830 --> 05:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
officers but the police and that and it
 
05:08:45.840 --> 05:08:46.750 align:start position:0%
officers but the police and that and it
was

05:08:46.750 --> 05:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:08:49.510 --> 05:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
legal the police the police officers
 
05:08:51.628 --> 05:08:51.638 align:start position:0%
decided to bring a suit against the
 
05:08:54.190 --> 05:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
dealer the theory being that well it
 
05:08:55.750 --> 05:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
might have been legal but you really
 
05:08:58.708 --> 05:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have sold the gun that's the
 
05:09:01.590 --> 05:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
that was the theory that to me was was a
 
05:09:03.390 --> 05:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
crazy area and the New Hampshire Supreme
 
05:09:05.670 --> 05:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
Court made the right decision we would
 
05:09:08.390 --> 05:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
be doing sort of the same thing here
 
05:09:11.868 --> 05:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
it's all right to to perform these
 
05:09:13.830 --> 05:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
surgeries it's legal which maybe it
 
05:09:15.548 --> 05:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
should be may I I would tend to say it
 
05:09:18.230 --> 05:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be but it is it's legal and
 
05:09:20.070 --> 05:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is go after the
 
05:09:22.270 --> 05:09:22.280 align:start position:0%
doctor for doing something that was
 
05:09:26.390 --> 05:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
legal um I don't see how that makes any
 
05:09:28.430 --> 05:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
sense and as representative D Lorenzo
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
pointed out if there has really been
 
05:09:33.670 --> 05:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
some malpractice
 
05:09:37.470 --> 05:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
um the the minor has a claim for for
 
05:09:39.190 --> 05:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
that kind of malpractice just like they
 
05:09:41.750 --> 05:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
would have for any other malpractice so
 
05:09:43.990 --> 05:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
I I don't see any reason for this sort
 
05:09:45.150 --> 05:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
of special
 
05:09:51.510 --> 05:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill um other other uh representative
 
05:09:54.868 --> 05:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
Stapleton boy it's really hair splitting
 
05:09:56.868 --> 05:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
um with good points on both sides of
 
05:09:59.390 --> 05:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
this I just
 
05:09:59.400 --> 05:10:01.030 align:start position:0%
this I just
wonder

05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
wonder
 
05:10:01.040 --> 05:10:04.270 align:start position:0%
wonder
um

05:10:04.270 --> 05:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:04.280 --> 05:10:05.670 align:start position:0%
 
lost

05:10:05.670 --> 05:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
lost
 
05:10:05.680 --> 05:10:08.470 align:start position:0%
lost
it

05:10:08.470 --> 05:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:10:12.190 --> 05:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
um Physicians are they not held to a
 
05:10:14.990 --> 05:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
higher standard and that's the last
 
05:10:17.628 --> 05:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
resort for reasonable
 
05:10:21.230 --> 05:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
decision parents come to the physician
 
05:10:23.868 --> 05:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
for Trans treatment with the
 
05:10:25.948 --> 05:10:25.958 align:start position:0%
child and
 
05:10:29.030 --> 05:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
um the the physician has to make an
 
05:10:31.350 --> 05:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation not only just write the order
 
05:10:34.910 --> 05:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
and say yes but investigate a little bit
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
and query a little bit to see if uh
 
05:10:40.628 --> 05:10:40.638 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong here or they
 
05:10:43.548 --> 05:10:43.558 align:start position:0%
should step back from it sure I think I
 
05:10:45.070 --> 05:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
think so there's held to the standard of
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
care of a reasonable physician in those
 
05:10:49.270 --> 05:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
circumstan I would think that that
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely would impose upon the phys
 
05:10:54.190 --> 05:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does it it puts
 
05:10:57.430 --> 05:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
the onus on the position to be the last
 
05:10:59.830 --> 05:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
bull workk but that I mean that that
 
05:11:02.390 --> 05:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
onus already exists under existing law
 
05:11:05.430 --> 05:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
if the if the physician has hasn't done
 
05:11:07.948 --> 05:11:07.958 align:start position:0%
that they're liable under existing law
 
05:11:11.310 --> 05:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
yeah it may be redundant but but it's an
 
05:11:14.390 --> 05:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
Awakening all right other yes
 
05:11:14.400 --> 05:11:16.990 align:start position:0%

05:11:29.430 --> 05:11:29.440 align:start position:0%

05:11:34.430 --> 05:11:34.440 align:start position:0%

05:18:40.270 --> 05:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
motion no all
 
05:18:43.350 --> 05:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
right that's fine sorry representative
 
05:18:45.070 --> 05:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
Stapleton anything you wants to say yeah
 
05:18:47.548 --> 05:18:47.558 align:start position:0%
I give it a few words um I didn't see
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
any value or much of a value in the
 
05:18:52.628 --> 05:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
amendment and I don't see any value in
 
05:18:55.510 --> 05:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
the underlying Bill uh I think it goes
 
05:18:57.390 --> 05:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
over the fence relative to the
 
05:18:57.400 --> 05:18:58.510 align:start position:0%
over the fence relative to the
traditional

05:18:58.510 --> 05:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
05:19:02.470 --> 05:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
lawful um definition of Consortium and
 
05:19:06.070 --> 05:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
expands it what else is next beyond that
 
05:19:08.110 --> 05:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
uh I I just think it's not a good way to
 
05:19:11.510 --> 05:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
go so I'm opposed to I'm I'm for the itl
 
05:19:14.350 --> 05:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
all right any other representative Kenny
 
05:19:16.708 --> 05:19:16.718 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman so I fully
 
05:19:18.310 --> 05:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
understand the slipy slope argument and
 
05:19:20.190 --> 05:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
I fully understand why people are
 
05:19:22.948 --> 05:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
supporting itl um some of you may know
 
05:19:25.590 --> 05:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
may not know I used to be chair of the
 
05:19:27.868 --> 05:19:27.878 align:start position:0%
animal protection caucus with Kathy
 
05:19:30.548 --> 05:19:30.558 align:start position:0%
Rogers um so although I don't think this
 
05:19:32.310 --> 05:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
bill is necessarily ready for prime time
 
05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't and I know the amendment
 
05:19:36.670 --> 05:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough support um I am going
 
05:19:38.830 --> 05:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
to vote against itl but I fully
 
05:19:41.030 --> 05:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
understand why everyone is um voting the
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
way they are thank you all right any
 
05:19:44.910 --> 05:19:44.920 align:start position:0%

where they fell on it
 
05:20:27.670 --> 05:20:27.680 align:start position:0%

the Humane Society fell on it or if they
 
05:20:35.548 --> 05:20:35.558 align:start position:0%
