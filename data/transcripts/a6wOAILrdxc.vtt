Pearl representative representing
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
Merrimack District 26 the talents of
 
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
Loudoun Canterbury Northfield Boston and
 
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
Ward 3 of Franklin
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to introduce House Bill
 
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419 align:start position:0%
532 establishing a animal records
 
00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:57.419 align:start position:0%
database excuse me
 
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
the uh so this bill as uh representative
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
major stated it came to the environment
 
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
and agricultural committee and it's a
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
bill that was in the works from last
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
year as well we made some significant
 
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
changes through the amendment process
 
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
when it came into our committee this
 
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
this bill does establish an animal
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
database and in its original form would
 
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
have uh tracked health certificate
 
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
transfers as well as it would have
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
included rabies certificates and there
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
was uh several fees that were associated
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
with the uh and with the health
 
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
certificates and the rabies certificates
 
00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:36.899 align:start position:0%
can we spend a long time on this bill
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
especially behind the scenes
 
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby and I have probably
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
have close to 40 hours into fixing this
 
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
bill and making some changes and getting
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
it to the Fine form that is being
 
00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:49.019 align:start position:0%
presented to you today in
 
00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
the some of the major changes that we've
 
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
made is we removed the uh all of the
 
00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
fees that were in the bill and we made
 
00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
them into an appropriation
 
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
again I'm winging this here I don't have
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
the notes on this one exactly so my
 
00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
apologies if I I Stumble a little bit
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
we uh we also added a lot of database
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
security into the build because there
 
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
was some issues with that and we added
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
in a doit position because we worked
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
with commissioner Jasper and with
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner Goulet from doit and we
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
found that there was a real need for a
 
00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:29.779 align:start position:0%
doit position inside of the uh
 
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
the agricultural Department not only for
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
this bill but other areas where they're
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
already working they were they were
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
really short so we decided we would just
 
00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:39.899 align:start position:0%
address it completely in this bill and
 
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
put one full-time person in I'll let the
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner speak more to them but I
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
believe if my memory serves me correctly
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
they had like one twentieth of one
 
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.769 align:start position:0%
they had like one twentieth of one
person

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
dedicated to uh to doing their doit work
 
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
which translates to roughly two hours a
 
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
week and they they were falling short in
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
that area as well
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
so we have we did add that in sort of a
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
little bit of the background on this not
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
to take up too much of your time but in
 
00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
the 2019 budget there were some changes
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
that were made in requirements for
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
becoming a pet vendors and registering
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
as a pet vendor excuse me the threshold
 
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
was was cut right in half and it swept
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
in a whole group of other people that
 
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
are breeders that were transferring
 
00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
animals and that hadn't originally had
 
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
to register as they've had done there
 
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
so when the department was asked to
 
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
manage this they were doing it by
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
tracking Health certificates and the
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner again can speak to that but
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
they we received testimony in DNA that
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
they were receiving somewhere I mean it
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
was an astronomical number 60 or 80 000
 
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
of these certificates a year that they
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
were trying to manage and track and they
 
00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:47.579 align:start position:0%
were all coming in in paper form they
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
still are
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
and so uh what this database will do
 
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
will is it will move them up to the 21st
 
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
century and allow them to the
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
veterinarians to directly enter that
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
information and into the database and
 
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
therefore the department will not have
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
to try and they figure out how to manage
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
these um and again the commissioner can
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
speak to what they've been doing they've
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
set up some type of a Excel spreadsheet
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
or something of that form that they've
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
been trying to re-enter these
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
certificates in and it's very
 
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
problematic and basically they can't do
 
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
their job they can't do what was
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
mandated of them so
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
we in in a nutshell we brought this back
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
down we narrowed it down to just Health
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
certificates uh there is some areas
 
00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
within the uh build that are dealing
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
with using monies for other dedicated
 
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
funds which is why it's in front of you
 
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
for the initial setup but the funding of
 
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
the of the bill itself will come from uh
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
the appropriation that we've put in
 
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
I think I'm going to stop there because
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
I've covered most all of it and I don't
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
want to Ramble On too far and I'll open
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
up for questions and answer what I can
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
and again the some of the technical
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
questions about uh part of it you may
 
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
want to throw to the commissioner as
 
00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
well so with that I'll I'll be happy to
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that I'm able to
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Pearl uh
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
representative Bromley followed by
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
representative Elmer
 
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl uh
 
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the fiscal note and uh I
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
have a sinking feeling that the fiscal
 
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.329 align:start position:0%
have a sinking feeling that the fiscal
note

00:12:20.329 --> 00:12:20.339 align:start position:0%
note
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
was before the bill was amended uh one
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
thing it says is that there's a two
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
dollar fee
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
the bill establishes a two dollar fee on
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
the submission of animal health
 
00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.690 align:start position:0%
the submission of animal health
certificates

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
is that fee gone
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
yes it is in my apologies that was one
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
other point that I meant to uh to
 
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
mention the the fiscal note was on the
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
original bill it was not updated I had
 
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
spoken with Dave alaconis about updating
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
this fiscal note when it was in our
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
committee and he informed me that he was
 
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
not able to do that until it passed the
 
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
house floor I was under the assumption
 
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
that when it came to you as a second
 
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
committee bill that that would have been
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
done but I see it was not again my
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
apologies I'm not mentioning that that
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
was part of my notes I guess I skipped
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
over quickly here
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
oh and uh it does it does talk about
 
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh transfer of funds there's a certain
 
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
like the product scale testing fund
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
and let's stay with that one for
 
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
instance so that's still in place in the
 
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:26.870 align:start position:0%
instance so that's still in place in the
bill

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh there's still going to be transfer
 
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
funds from certain dedicated funds is
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
that is correct I I would uh defer you
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner to give you some
 
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
real details on that as he is much more
 
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
versed on those individual funds than I
 
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.009 align:start position:0%
versed on those individual funds than I
am

00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:43.019 align:start position:0%
am
 
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
just just for the record uh members who
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
were here last year uh we spent a lot of
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
time on this bill as well so I was
 
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:53.540 align:start position:0%
someone familiar with it
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
is much appreciated we when we adopted
 
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
the language we used these suggestions
 
00:13:59.810 --> 00:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
that were made last year in the Ways and
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
Means Committee so we appreciate that
 
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.629 align:start position:0%
Means Committee so we appreciate that
work

00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay representative
 
00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:10.459 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:12.839 align:start position:0%
also spent a lot of time working on this
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
last year and on the new version of this
 
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
which takes out the fees on then makes
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
no way as far as I can tell to reimburse
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
the the two funds that are being rated
 
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:34.019 align:start position:0%
from and we determined last term that uh
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
the Agricultural Product and scale
 
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:38.339 align:start position:0%
testing which is actually mostly animal
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
feed uh sales uh that that one is
 
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
receiving in more money than it really
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
needs and is built up quite a surplus
 
00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:51.380 align:start position:0%
that could be used but it wasn't enough
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
for the objective which was to to create
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
the on the software
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
for this new uh database
 
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
and so they added in the integrated Pest
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
Management fund which on only had a
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
surplus because they had been without an
 
00:15:17.329 --> 00:15:17.339 align:start position:0%
integrated Pest Management staffer for I
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
forget a couple of years at least an
 
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
integrated test management is really
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
important to agriculture
 
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:29.180 align:start position:0%
and um in this state
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
and on
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
the idea at the time was that if on
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
those new fees came in enough they would
 
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
completely reimburse the integrated Pest
 
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
Management fund and then uh as much as
 
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
they could in within two years after
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
which it would just stabilize on they
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
would reimburse the animal feed
 
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
on program
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
which on oversees on all of our pet food
 
00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:05.459 align:start position:0%
mostly but also animal food for for
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
Farmers on and make sure that people
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
aren't being soldings that are uh
 
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.790 align:start position:0%
aren't being soldings that are uh
dangerous

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.230 align:start position:0%
dangerous
so

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
um that's my brief version of it so my
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
question is have you discussed
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
how what is going to happen to the
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
integrated Pest Management program of
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.509 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
um

00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
with no extra money coming in and those
 
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
two funds being on what we call when
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
we're not being polite rated
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative I
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate you filling in some of the uh
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
the background in the blanks I I was
 
00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
trying to keep it brief I again I'm
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
going to defer a lot of the technical
 
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
parts of that to the commissioner
 
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
because he has done a lot of work on on
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
those funds and what the sustainability
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
of them and what their ability is to uh
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
have some funds withdrawn from them I
 
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
will add this um the committee looked at
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
the fee portion of this bill for a long
 
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:08.339 align:start position:0%
time and have a good amount of
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
discussion about it and we really felt
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
that the legislature had had enacted
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
this um this requirement on the
 
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
department back in the 2019 budget and
 
00:17:20.929 --> 00:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
we didn't feel that it was fair to put
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
that onto the backs of all of the animal
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
owners of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
through the fees on rabies certificates
 
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
and health transfers by putting a two
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
dollar fee on the rabies certificates
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
you virtually are affecting every animal
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
owner in the state of New Hampshire and
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
we just did not feel that was fair and
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
it was good policy for for New Hampshire
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
animal Agriculture and for the pet
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
owners and so we uh we stripped that out
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
of it and uh I guess you can use the
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
word rated I'm fine with that
 
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
we still feel that those funds are being
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
used within the uh within the
 
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
agricultural community and so we didn't
 
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
have a as big of an issue but I do
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
understand there was a concern with the
 
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
IPM and I know that commissioner Jasper
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
has a lot of information nation that he
 
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
can share on that so I'll defer the
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
details to him
 
00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:10.700 align:start position:0%
also representative
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
yes for the moment
 
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:16.730 align:start position:0%
okay there's no other hands up
 
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:17.870 align:start position:0%
okay there's no other hands up
[Music]

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper
 
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record I am
 
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
commissioner Sean Jasper the New
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Agriculture
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
markets and food and it's always a
 
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be before my uh
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
formal former committee
 
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:33.890 align:start position:0%
formal former committee
um

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
that I was a member of for several terms
 
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
in my former life as a state
 
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.909 align:start position:0%
in my former life as a state
representative

00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of questions out there
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
it might be more productive but I leave
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
that to you
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
for us to just fill in the blanks and
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
talk about this through the questions
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
rather than me
 
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
um rambling on which I'm always happy to
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
do anyhow but um
 
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
you might prefer to to get to the points
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
by asking
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
um questions I could of course respond
 
00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:03.299 align:start position:0%
to some of Representative almie's
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:11.780 align:start position:0%
uh did you want to respond to any of her
 
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
comments sure so
 
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
while you know frankly I am a a
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
proponent of of fees for user fees which
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
this primarily
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
um would have been uh the house decided
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
to to take that out which complicates
 
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
things and so there is a 250 000
 
00:19:33.059 --> 00:19:35.390 align:start position:0%
things and so there is a 250 000
appropriation

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
um within the bill to to fund the
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing maintenance
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh now what is not appropriate at this
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
point we are expecting a updated fiscal
 
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
note from uh commissioner Goulet as to
 
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
the cost of the new position that is
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
also not in the bill and so the that'll
 
00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
be somewhere in the vicinity of of a
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars so the total
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
cost without the fee to the general fund
 
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
would be about three hundred and fifty
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
uh annually in terms of the funds right
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
from the beginning
 
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
um I I recognize that it was probably
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
pretty much impossible to get a million
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
dollar appropriation which is our
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
estimate working with various vendors of
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
what it might cost to actually develop
 
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
this program and so between that and the
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
fee I was trying to make this uh whole
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
program neutral to the general fund that
 
00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:36.539 align:start position:0%
was before we really realized that it
 
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
was going to be necessary to have an I.T
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
person as well
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.150 align:start position:0%
so the
um

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
product and scale testing fund which is
 
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.730 align:start position:0%
product and scale testing fund which is
somewhat

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:48.740 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
misnamed because it really has nothing
 
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
to do with scale testing for some reason
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
money was coming out of here related to
 
00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
weights and measures in the scale
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
testing but no Revenue comes into it
 
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
from that so this is really all just
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
money that comes in from animal products
 
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
animal foods and treats and anything
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
that an animal might
 
00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.130 align:start position:0%
that an animal might
consume

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
consume
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that fund is estimated
 
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.409 align:start position:0%
so that fund is estimated
um in

00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
in this next year to peek out at a
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
balance of about 1.7 million dollars you
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
know of course that's an estimate right
 
00:21:30.409 --> 00:21:30.419 align:start position:0%
now we we closed out fiscal year 20 with
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
about a million and a half left in in
 
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
the fund
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
due to the covet pandemic and the
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
governor's orders to uh reduce our
 
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
budgets we've pulled more out of this
 
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.310 align:start position:0%
budgets we've pulled more out of this
budget

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
uh to avoid layoffs in the department
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
and so with that taken into
 
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.990 align:start position:0%
and so with that taken into
consideration

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.590 align:start position:0%
consideration
um

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
at the end of fiscal year 23 we're
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
anticipating a balance of their in that
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
fund of still about nine hundred
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
um now
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
and I will will tell you that since the
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
governor last week
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
opened the budget up a little bit
 
00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:15.059 align:start position:0%
because of the revenues and increasing
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'm probably going to seek permission to
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
get some of the money back in these two
 
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
funds that we have budgeted for ongoing
 
00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:24.539 align:start position:0%
operations because neither of these
 
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
funds will be sustainable if this
 
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
becomes the way we try to fund the the
 
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.610 align:start position:0%
becomes the way we try to fund the the
department

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
um so obviously going from you know a
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
million and a half and twenty to nine
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
in um in 23 without taking any money out
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
for this program makes this fund
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
non-sustainable as to the pesticides
 
00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:48.169 align:start position:0%
non-sustainable as to the pesticides
fund

00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh we closed out
 
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 with just over 2 million
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
in it
 
00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and we're looking to to budget about
 
00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
three quarters of a million dollars out
 
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
of that between the normal programs that
 
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
and we've asked and the governor did
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
include it in hospital too a provision
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
to allow us to fund the division uh part
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
of the division from that fund so that
 
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
three quarters of a million dollars
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
of expenditure compares to about five
 
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars of income
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
so again is not sustainable at that
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
level long term but this was a stop Gap
 
00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:29.630 align:start position:0%
level long term but this was a stop Gap
measure

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
measure
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
um we're we're projecting that with that
 
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
without anything to do with the database
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
we ended up about a million and a half
 
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
left in the fund at the close of fiscal
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
year 23. so drawing that down for
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
budgetary purposes by by about a half a
 
00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
million dollars so between the two funds
 
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
we're projecting
 
00:23:53.649 --> 00:23:53.659 align:start position:0%
that we would close out fiscal year 23
 
00:23:57.289 --> 00:23:57.299 align:start position:0%
with just about two million dollars in
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
the fund which leaves us plenty of money
 
00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
between the two funds to uh to fund this
 
00:24:03.179 --> 00:24:07.010 align:start position:0%
between the two funds to uh to fund this
database

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
and so I'll stop there and you really
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
worked hard in trying to accomplish this
 
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
well it's we're not doing the job that
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
the legislature has has mandated us to
 
00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:22.010 align:start position:0%
the legislature has has mandated us to
do

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
um and the only way to do it is with a
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
database so as representative Pearl said
 
00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
uh we're doing everything manually but
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
what he didn't tell you is there's about
 
00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:32.990 align:start position:0%
what he didn't tell you is there's about
80

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
80
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
000 Health certificates that are issued
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
in the state a year
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
we don't receive anywhere near 80 000
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
here because we have no way to file them
 
00:24:45.649 --> 00:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
we have no way even if we got them we
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
don't have enough room to have filing
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
cabinets to put those 80 000 documents
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
in a year
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
so primarily some veterinarians just
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
send them in
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
but most of the ones we get is are the
 
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
ones that we request because we suspect
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
there may be people who are operating as
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
pet vendors without a license or where
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
you know something related to that and
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
we request from in one case we looked at
 
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
a a range
 
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
um of veterinarians within uh
 
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
the the location of the person we
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
suspected was a pet vendor and requested
 
00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:27.299 align:start position:0%
the records from all of those
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
veterinarians and in some cases we had
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
to request them several times because we
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
suspect some you know didn't want to be
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
seen as ratting out if you will on their
 
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.470 align:start position:0%
seen as ratting out if you will on their
client

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
client
 
00:25:42.049 --> 00:25:42.059 align:start position:0%
uh so it's very time consuming and then
 
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
we had to sort through all of those and
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
having a database would allow us to to
 
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
do those type of searches with a push of
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
the button
 
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
and be able to comply with what the
 
00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:53.870 align:start position:0%
and be able to comply with what the
state

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh would do
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
um being in the you know dealing with
 
00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:00.059 align:start position:0%
pet vending is not something the
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture really wants
 
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
to be doing but it's what you've told us
 
00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
you want us to do and so we need to do
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
it the best we can and this is
 
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
this is the only way that we can even
 
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
come close to doing what you've asked us
 
00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
to do thank you commissioner
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bromley I have a question
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh always good to see you
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
good to see you so um so the two funds
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
agriculture product fund and the
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
integrated Pest Management fund
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I'm clear on
 
00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:36.059 align:start position:0%
this are going to be used to fund
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
the development of the software is that
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
correct that is that is correct because
 
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
currently they're both carrying a
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
balance higher than anything we we could
 
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
possibly anticipate needing that that
 
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
balance or
 
00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:51.740 align:start position:0%
and follow-up would be uh and then
 
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
instead of asking for a two dollar fee
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
for rabies vaccinations or whatever
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
you've now chosen a 350
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
000 annual appropriation
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
to maintain the database well we haven't
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
asked for that um that was not something
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
we were proponents of that was what the
 
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
environment AG committee decided to do
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
they didn't want want the fee that's the
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
legislative prerogative my job was to
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
come up with a way to fund this uh they
 
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
also didn't feel that it was necessary
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
to have the rabies uh certificates
 
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
included in this uh and that's that's
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
fine it does make the program a little
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
bit simpler we just felt that at the
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
time that was probably something that uh
 
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
was a good thing to do but it's not
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
necessary for our our mission
 
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
would have helped Town clerks and police
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
departments but really not the
 
00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture so while this
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't change the maintenance
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
fee if there were a fee in here just on
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
the health certificates
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
which we're changing to certificates of
 
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.930 align:start position:0%
which we're changing to certificates of
transfer

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
we would probably be looking at a a fee
 
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.130 align:start position:0%
we would probably be looking at a a fee
of

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
for the total cost to make this Revenue
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
neutral probably be in the vicinity of
 
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
four dollars and fifty cents
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
um or so to make it totally Revenue
 
00:28:20.159 --> 00:28:23.029 align:start position:0%
um or so to make it totally Revenue
neutral

00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.169 --> 00:28:26.179 align:start position:0%
um and that needs to be weighed against
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
the fact that you know when you're
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
looking at transfers particularly of
 
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
dogs you can be looking at cost of about
 
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars a dog I mean
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
obviously some are much less than that
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
but you're still talking hundreds the
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
veterinary examination is not going to
 
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
be cheap so you know our particular
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
feeling is that
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
um a fee of you know four dollars and
 
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
fifty cents or five dollars a transfer
 
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
certificate is um
 
00:28:59.450 --> 00:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
very reasonable and not a not a burden
 
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
but that's not our call that that is
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature's call to make I just
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to put it into perspective for
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
you uh follow up Mr chair
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
okay so this is something that you're
 
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
proposing here it's not in the bill
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh the uh
 
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh agriculture committee didn't
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
recommend us
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh but this is you're saying that if if
 
00:29:26.769 --> 00:29:26.779 align:start position:0%
we did not want a general fund
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
appropriation this is for the ongoing
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
this is for the ongoing money yes
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
if we don't want to go to the to the
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
general fund to get money
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
to maintain this these programs
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
that a 4.50
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh fee on health certificates is one
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
option that we we could consider is that
 
00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm hearing is that correct
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
that's our our best estimate in in that
 
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
in with the fact that we actually don't
 
00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
know how many Health certificates are
 
00:29:59.690 --> 00:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
currently being issued because we don't
 
00:30:02.169 --> 00:30:02.179 align:start position:0%
receive them all right our best estimate
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
is the um
 
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
eight eighty thousand a year
 
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
and so if you do the the math based on
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
um you know come close to 450 to to
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
cover the total expenses Mr chair I have
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
one more just one more now one more
 
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.630 align:start position:0%
one more just one more now one more
follow-up

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:24.059 align:start position:0%
um so the two funds the agriculture
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
product fund and the integrated Pest
 
00:30:29.049 --> 00:30:29.059 align:start position:0%
Management fund
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
refresh refresh our memories as to on
 
00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:33.539 align:start position:0%
the normal times or currently current
 
00:30:33.539 --> 00:30:34.510 align:start position:0%
the normal times or currently current
times

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
where does that money go who is it just
 
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
wind up in your general budget no uh how
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
is that how are those dollars spent now
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
the product and scale testing fund is a
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
is a fund that
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
um we are you free to use
 
00:30:59.570 --> 00:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
however we want based on on the budget
 
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
so we have been budgeting
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
all our of our vehicles through that
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
fund we have been
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
budgeting the director of weights and
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
measures and other uh at least another
 
00:31:12.889 --> 00:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
position there so in normal times we
 
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
have been spending
 
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.250 align:start position:0%
have been spending
around

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:31:20.289 --> 00:31:20.299 align:start position:0%
you know probably on average about 400
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh to 500 000 in that and it's been
 
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
bringing in about five hundred thousand
 
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:27.830 align:start position:0%
bringing in about five hundred thousand
dollars

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
of Revenue it has been growing slightly
 
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:32.810 align:start position:0%
of Revenue it has been growing slightly
um

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
in that and that varies so what I've
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
done in this current budget is have it
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
more aligned more accurately now for
 
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
savings and looking at our Fleet we've
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
decided to forego buying
 
00:31:47.159 --> 00:31:47.930 align:start position:0%
decided to forego buying
um

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
new cars we may have one or two in there
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
this time but primarily focusing on
 
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:57.059 align:start position:0%
using that to avoid layoffs so we've
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
moved that up to um total expenditure of
 
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.930 align:start position:0%
moved that up to um total expenditure of
900

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
900
 
00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
000 versus a revenue of
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars in in
 
00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
round round numbers so that's why not
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
sustainable that's why I I'm hoping to
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
talk to the other representative Ober
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
who is the uh division chairman for my
 
00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
budget uh to see if we can at least do
 
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
something in the second year because I
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
think as you all know it's going to be
 
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
harder to get a lot of money back going
 
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
forward and
 
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to put these funds in
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
danger as terms of the pesticide fund
 
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of that is for uh has
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
been for programming
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
in Grants
 
00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:45.059 align:start position:0%
nowhere near enough of the those grants
 
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
have been coming in so we've been
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
getting about again about half half a
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars into that fund and let
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
me back up a minute so on the
 
00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.149 align:start position:0%
me back up a minute so on the
uh

00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
fund relative to the uh
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
um product and scale testing fund that's
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
a 50 50 split between
 
00:33:09.169 --> 00:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
um general fund and the uh
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
in our in our fund so 50 of what we
 
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
collect goes into the general fund 50
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
stays here in the pesticide fund it's 75
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
of what we collect goes to the state
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
general fund and 25 goes into this this
 
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
fund so we've been collecting about a
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars we've been
 
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.470 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars we've been
spending

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
spending
 
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh roughly a quarter of a million
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
dollars a year so that fund has been
 
00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
building up rather rapidly and I do
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
think it makes a great deal of sense to
 
00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:45.059 align:start position:0%
be funding other positions
 
00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:48.299 align:start position:0%
um from from this fund uh the fee has
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
not gone up it
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
in either of these areas the fees have
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
not gone up in uh in decades
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
um and so we're we're quite reasonable
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
and actually lower than than many other
 
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
states in both of these areas but we are
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
budgeting out of uh the pesticide fund
 
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
three quarters of a million dollars
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
versus the
 
00:34:11.399 --> 00:34:12.290 align:start position:0%
versus the
um

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
the half a million of
 
00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
so again pulling down these funds
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
neither are sustainable
 
00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:19.430 align:start position:0%
neither are sustainable
um

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we do with the
 
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
with the database at the current level I
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
can't sustain the funds but it was a way
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
to make sure we didn't lay off employees
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
and particularly in the air pesticides
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
that would be a huge mistake to lay
 
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
people off because we need to have good
 
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
regulations of pesticides and those who
 
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:45.500 align:start position:0%
are who are applying those those
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
pesticides to our um
 
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
to fields and homes and Orchards and
 
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
everywhere so
 
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers your question thank
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
you commissioner a lot of us have chats
 
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.410 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
on commissioner you had last time said
 
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
that the IPM fund was supposed to have a
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
staffer who worked with integrated Pest
 
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
Management that's what it's called
 
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:20.540 align:start position:0%
that's what it's supposed to do
 
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:25.640 align:start position:0%
uh and now you're telling us that
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
that um it's basically feeding the
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
and that there's not enough money for
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
either a staffer or the grants that were
 
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:40.940 align:start position:0%
being done no I I'm sorry
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
no I I apologize if I if I let you to
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
that conclusion that's 700
 
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.650 align:start position:0%
that conclusion that's 700
um

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
roughly seven seven hundred fifty
 
00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
thousand does include that staffer that
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
was currently authorized plus I believe
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
two more plus all of the grants that we
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
anticipate being so it's all related to
 
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
the any expenditures would actually be
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
related to the programs and the uh in
 
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
the operation of
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh of pesticides so nothing other than
 
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
what we might be taking out for
 
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
um for the the database everything else
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's coming out of there is directly
 
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
except for the three quarters of it that
 
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
goes to the general fund yeah that's and
 
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
that's always been the way so if you
 
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
look at the department as a whole
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
um now the governor did approve our our
 
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.930 align:start position:0%
um now the governor did approve our our
priorities

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
so with these funds with everything else
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
we do the Department of Agriculture is
 
00:36:52.849 --> 00:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
almost Revenue neutral without the
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
set-asides we we the department is
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
revenue positive to the general fund by
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand but that does not
 
00:37:00.839 --> 00:37:02.030 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand but that does not
include

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
million dollars roughly from uh
 
00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
pesticides it goes to the general fund
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
anyhow and the 500 000 that goes to
 
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:16.910 align:start position:0%
anyhow and the 500 000 that goes to
um

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
from from the product scale testing so
 
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
that's an additional million and a half
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
so our whole operation is very much net
 
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
so excuse me but what that means is that
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
agriculture which a lot of people think
 
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
is important to this state on and which
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
in a worse economic position than of
 
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
most of the industry in this state is
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
paying money into the general fund
 
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.790 align:start position:0%
paying money into the general fund
uh

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:59.290 --> 00:37:59.300 align:start position:0%
on a net basis correct
 
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
and things like making sure that there
 
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
isn't pesticide that's going to kill us
 
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
on our apples uh
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
is underfunded
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
well I I wouldn't say
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
I mean under we don't have any
 
00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
additional requests but had we not gone
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
this route we would have to lay off
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
people in in the department that is that
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
is correct we were not given
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
um enough appropriation within the
 
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.069 align:start position:0%
um enough appropriation within the
governor's

00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:31.079 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:32.270 align:start position:0%
governor's
um

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
budget to fully fund all our positions
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
so I had to raid raid the funds and seek
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
authorization which was has been granted
 
00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:47.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
I understand on if your agency has been
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
a step child in the budget process for a
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
very long time first at least as long as
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
I've been around
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
so on I did want to ask some other
 
00:39:11.329 --> 00:39:11.339 align:start position:0%
questions though on if I may go ahead Mr
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you on there are I
 
00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
understand that was I hadn't noticed
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
what that was put in by the environment
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
and agriculture committee there is an
 
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
appropriation which is only for the
 
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the database once it is
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
set up uh and your estimate is that the
 
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
debate database is going to cost about a
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars to set it up and that's
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
what it was last term too on and I
 
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
understand that if we keep this uh
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
requirement for
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
um on using the health certificates I
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
believe it was mostly on
 
00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
part of an initiative to make sure that
 
00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be on a lot of unhealthy
 
00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.170 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be on a lot of unhealthy
animals

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
animals
 
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
on traded in the state
 
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
but on
 
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
that as long as that initiative is there
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
that it is pretty much impossible for
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
you to carry out the job without the
 
00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.109 align:start position:0%
you to carry out the job without the
database

00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
on but there's an appropriate that
 
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
appropriation for 250
 
00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:23.579 align:start position:0%
000 Plus
 
00:40:23.579 --> 00:40:25.069 align:start position:0%
000 Plus
uh

00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand for a technical new
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
technical person in doit is something
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
that has to be considered in the budget
 
00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.230 align:start position:0%
that has to be considered in the budget
itself

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
by the finance committee and ended up
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
because there were originally fees in it
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
with the bill which is only in our
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
possession at this point it can't go to
 
00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:50.099 align:start position:0%
finance officially and I would like to
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
ask our chairman uh what we're going to
 
00:40:58.569 --> 00:40:58.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
we're still here I'll get a hold of Ken
 
00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
and discuss this with them
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
yeah and and went over because she's in
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
charge of division one which was my
 
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
division when I was on finance we did a
 
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
lot of Agriculture work
 
00:41:17.569 --> 00:41:17.579 align:start position:0%
is the chairman of Lynn is the vice
 
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
are you also being honest
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.609 --> 00:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
yes uh can you hear me yes uh good
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
morning commissioner good to see you
 
00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:38.660 align:start position:0%
you're looking very Dapper Dan today
 
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
and uh let me uh Begin by saying that I
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
love animals I had a Britney spaniel uh
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
hunting dog that I went out into the
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
woods with for over 20 years in my
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
younger days
 
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
and uh so I really want to emphasize
 
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
that I do love animals
 
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
number two you mentioned a commissioner
 
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
that you were thinking about a cost of
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
four to five four to four dollars and
 
00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
fifty cents and I would uh personally
 
00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:14.579 align:start position:0%
feel that it would not be
 
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
uh detrimental to me as a hunter uh to
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
be charged the the fee of five dollars
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
as much uh in order to get the
 
00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:29.579 align:start position:0%
certificate uh is that anathema
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
to tell just the hunter or the just the
 
00:42:35.569 --> 00:42:35.579 align:start position:0%
people that have animals that they're
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay a five dollar
 
00:42:41.089 --> 00:42:41.099 align:start position:0%
certificate would that kill that bill I
 
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
think he talked about the fourth
 
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.030 align:start position:0%
think he talked about the fourth
district

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:47.180 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to keep this
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
self-supporting because feed has been
 
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
removed by the agricultural committee so
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about the fee right
 
00:42:55.079 --> 00:42:58.250 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about the fee right
now

00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
I thought the fee of two dollars was
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it's been withdrawn yes
 
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
and there's there's no new fee that
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
we're considering at this point in time
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
all right so my my point is that if I
 
00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
were to write a bill to say that you got
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
to pay five dollars if you're an animal
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
owner would that be appropriate at this
 
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
time to ask the commissioner if that
 
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.089 --> 00:43:35.099 align:start position:0%
this time it wouldn't be considered
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
until next year
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Elliott one of
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
the things and
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
um my words were sort of used against me
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
on on the floor speech
 
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:49.220 align:start position:0%
um on this bill because what I said was
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm really not worried about
 
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
getting into the details of this bill at
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
that at this point because it's going to
 
00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
take a couple years to develop this
 
00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:00.170 align:start position:0%
take a couple years to develop this
database

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.430 align:start position:0%
database
so

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
what's really the only thing that's
 
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
important to me right now
 
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
uh is to be able to begin the
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
development and have the authorization
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
to develop it so if the legislature were
 
00:44:17.329 --> 00:44:17.339 align:start position:0%
to rethink the idea of
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
um having a fee that could be done
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
anytime within the next two years the
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
appropriation that we're looking for for
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
the I.T uh person while that position
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
to have on board as this this is
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
developed we won't need the 250 000
 
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
at very least
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
um it very soonest until the second year
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
of the biennium probably not even then
 
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
but if we don't have the you know if
 
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
we're not honest about this moving
 
00:44:49.609 --> 00:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
forward it's going to be very difficult
 
00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
to come back and say oh yeah by the way
 
00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
we need 250 000. so what we're really
 
00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
looking for is the 250 000 and the
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
second second year of the biennium
 
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.390 align:start position:0%
second second year of the biennium
probably

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
uh if we're lucky some of that will be
 
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
needed in the second year but probably
 
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
not a full Year's maintenances
 
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
um we have a database that is being
 
00:45:11.819 --> 00:45:12.950 align:start position:0%
um we have a database that is being
developed

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
to replace one that was created by
 
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.089 align:start position:0%
to replace one that was created by
prisoners

00:45:17.089 --> 00:45:17.099 align:start position:0%
prisoners
 
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
that contract was signed with dlit
 
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
before I became commissioner and if
 
00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
we're lucky we'll be going live with
 
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
that weights and measures program this
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
year and I've been commissioner now for
 
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
for three years so I not really thinking
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
we're gonna gonna get this going too
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
quickly because even if it's approved
 
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
July 1st we'll have to go out to bid
 
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
um probably won't be awarding a contract
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
earlier than the end of the year and
 
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.309 align:start position:0%
earlier than the end of the year and
then

00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
you know that only leaves a year and a
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
half for development within this
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
biennium so any other changes as I I've
 
00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.470 align:start position:0%
biennium so any other changes as I I've
said

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
not really concerned about right now the
 
00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:02.339 align:start position:0%
bill Works mechanically
 
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
but I recognize that people may have
 
00:46:08.329 --> 00:46:08.339 align:start position:0%
some other other ideas on how to fund it
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
or what should be in it what shouldn't
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
be plenty of time to discuss that um
 
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
in another year
 
00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Pearl
 
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:20.690 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Pearl
foreign

00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I just wanted to
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
add that I've had extensive
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
conversations with the finance uh chair
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
Weiler about this bill and he is
 
00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
understanding of what it requires and
 
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
what it would need to uh to be in the
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
budget so I just wanted to give some
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
Assurance to the committee that Finance
 
00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
is well aware of this they're well aware
 
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
of the 250 000 appropriation and that we
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
were looking for uh a doit position my
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
estimate to uh chairman Weiler was
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
around 350 000 would need to be in the
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
budget and he has um mentioned to me
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
that he would uh when the time is right
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
he would like me to draft up a couple of
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
amendments adding that into house bill
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
2. so just so the committee is aware
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you great information about that
 
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.270 align:start position:0%
thank you great information about that
Pearl

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative the model
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
it was a hand but it's gone so
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to comment or a
 
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:28.309 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to comment or a
question

00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:30.980 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
yeah uh this is for you Mr chair so to
 
00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
me it looks like the the only issues
 
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
that are before us
 
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
are addressing whether or not
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh the uh agriculture product fund and
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
the integrated Pest Management fund
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
some of those fees can be used for the
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
development of the software
 
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
am I missing something or is that
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
correct is that a correct statement
 
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
without destroying a little fund right
 
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
but this is something that will be be
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
discussing I'm sure yes okay the
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative tell me
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'd like to ask
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to provide a written
 
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
version of the statement he made early
 
00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
on about on all of where all the money
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
funds are on amounts are going and
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
coming from in those two funds on I
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
don't believe when the dedicated fund
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
committee looked at agriculture I can't
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
remember which year it was that on we
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
learned that we knew that on the animal
 
00:48:49.609 --> 00:48:49.619 align:start position:0%
products fund was essentially a general
 
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
fund of the department for instance
 
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's um I think it's very pertinent to
 
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
this whether there is enough money there
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
or can be put enough money there with
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
the help of Finance which we need to
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
collaborate with on those amendments
 
00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:12.530 align:start position:0%
collaborate with on those amendments
um

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
to make this work Sorry my phone's going
 
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.550 align:start position:0%
to make this work Sorry my phone's going
off

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
I'll be glad to um email to the entire
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
committee the
 
00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
the budget for those two funds

life I am very familiar with the history
 
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
of this database and I have
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
um several concerns and questions I was
 
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
not able to testify at the first
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
committee but I did listen to the
 
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
testimony that was provided there
 
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh what I have done and um I'll save you
 
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
the time-consuming uh you know my
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
background why I'm entitled to speak if
 
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
you have questions about my background
 
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
after I'm finished raising my concerns I
 
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
would invite questions about it or you
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
can simply do an internet search for my
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
name Lisa Marie mulkarn
 
00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.710 align:start position:0%
name Lisa Marie mulkarn
okay

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
um I went to the um what I'm concerned
 
00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
about now it sounds as if uh hearing
 
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner uh who has had um
 
00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:29.339 align:start position:0%
prisoners work on the database for
 
00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
weights and means which is very
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
concerning to me when I look at the
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
audit report from 2017 that was done on
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
the department and the significant
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
deficiencies that were noted by the
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
Auditors about how various fees and
 
00:52:50.089 --> 00:52:50.099 align:start position:0%
funds are reconciled there in the
 
00:52:50.099 --> 00:52:50.990 align:start position:0%
funds are reconciled there in the
department

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
there were very concerning um
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
deficiencies particularly regarding the
 
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
animal population control fund as an
 
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
example a random sample of you know 40
 
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
nearly 44 samples of those applications
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
for funding for the spay neuter program
 
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
there in New Hampshire
 
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
um 20 of them indicated that they didn't
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
qualify so nearly half of the people
 
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:25.140 align:start position:0%
sampled didn't even qualify so they were
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
not even financially qualified to
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
receive the low-cost spay neuter
 
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.470 align:start position:0%
receive the low-cost spay neuter
assistance

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
yet they they got it and then the
 
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information on
 
00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:38.339 align:start position:0%
all of those applications which includes
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
Social Security numbers drivers licenses
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
bank statements anything that you would
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
have to submit to prove neediness
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
were found to be uh subject to anyone
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
obtaining that information so there was
 
00:53:59.650 --> 00:53:59.660 align:start position:0%
significant identity theft opportunities
 
00:54:03.049 --> 00:54:03.059 align:start position:0%
there in in in that case and now I'm
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
hearing from the commissioner well you
 
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
know let's not add the five dollar fee
 
00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:09.059 align:start position:0%
to the pet to pet owners that's what
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
really you know killed it in the last
 
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
Committee just give me the money for the
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
database let's get that going I need
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
that appropriation no we also have
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
significant deficiencies in um our
 
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
administrative rules listed in that
 
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
audit report
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
and as far back as I believe it was 2012
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
or 2013
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
when the state veterinarian under the
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture moved to have
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
this quarantine
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
48-hour quarantine put in place for the
 
00:54:44.329 --> 00:54:44.339 align:start position:0%
animals that were coming through
 
00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:46.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
I asked I I volunteered my time
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
specifically I wanted to know what was
 
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
really the threat where was the threat
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
were there complaints being made where
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
these animals really causing harm where
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
their communicable diseases and not and
 
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
and I pulled a foia request out of the
 
00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
department and there was nothing to
 
00:55:08.329 --> 00:55:08.339 align:start position:0%
substantiate that quarantining back in
 
00:55:08.339 --> 00:55:10.329 align:start position:0%
substantiate that quarantining back in
2012-2013.

00:55:10.329 --> 00:55:10.339 align:start position:0%
2012-2013.
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
then in 2015
 
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 505 was offered to correct
 
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
some of the significant deficiencies in
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
RSA 437 to include simple things like
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
defining a licensed veterinarian
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
to allow people in New Hampshire to
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
engage in interstate commerce
 
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
as they're entitled to under the rights
 
00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution to obtain their pets
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
from any location any state and to
 
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
ensure its Health by allowing the state
 
00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:47.579 align:start position:0%
veterinarian to accept an out-of-state
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
health certificate
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
but no
 
00:55:53.569 --> 00:55:53.579 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen that bill got killed
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
and now you're telling me you need a
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars for a database a million
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
dollars for a database
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.710 align:start position:0%

to develop application software
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
that does far more than some random
 
00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
database for 80 000 Health certificates
 
00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
where is that number coming from
 
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
in this fiscal note it says it's coming
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
from some random random uh you know uh
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
data from some avma report or something
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
really I want to know where they're
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
coming from in the state of New
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I want to know how this money
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
is going to be managed what what the
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
processes are going to be put in place
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
this bill needs to be euthanized
 
00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:56.089 align:start position:0%
this bill needs to be euthanized
immediately

00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your testimony any
 
00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:03.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
I say no no questions in the committee
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to testify for or
 
00:57:09.119 --> 00:57:10.450 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to testify for or
against

00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:10.460 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:57:14.089 --> 00:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
representative major there's a Stacy
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.599 --> 00:57:23.150 align:start position:0%
 
representing

00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
representing
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
I mean commissioner Jasper did you want
 
00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
to make a comment
 
00:57:30.049 --> 00:57:30.059 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
I would encourage you to to go back and
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
look at the audit report which I have
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
just done
 
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
um and there are many inaccuracies in in
 
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
what you you heard
 
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.190 align:start position:0%
what you you heard
the

00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
um issue of course these were all things
 
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
the audit was performed before I became
 
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.609 align:start position:0%
the audit was performed before I became
commissioner

00:57:49.609 --> 00:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
the database that I refer to the weights
 
00:57:55.329 --> 00:57:55.339 align:start position:0%
and measures
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
developed that was something that was
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
done I think in the 70s and the 80s by
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire it was not at
 
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
the request of the Department of
 
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
Agriculture to have databases
 
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
constructed by the uh by prisoners I as
 
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
soon as I learned that I thought that
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
was a horrific idea
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
the numbers that we came up with for the
 
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
database were done through conversations
 
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
with three different uh vendors
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
particularly some who are already
 
00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
working with um with Vital Records out
 
00:58:30.049 --> 00:58:30.059 align:start position:0%
of the Secretary of State's office
 
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
because to to some degree it's a similar
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
system so those are not numbers that
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
came from some random organization they
 
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
came from meetings with vendors who are
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
interested in bidding on them and giving
 
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
us their best estimate
 
00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:50.819 align:start position:0%
and but certainly even the the audit
 
00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
does not I'm not sure what this has to
 
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
do with any of this
 
00:58:54.599 --> 00:58:55.730 align:start position:0%
do with any of this
but

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
um the identified
 
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
20 instances where the support of the
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
applications eligibility did not meet
 
00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
the administrative rule criteria
 
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
that's far different from saying they
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
did they were not eligible there just
 
00:59:14.569 --> 00:59:14.579 align:start position:0%
was a lack of documentation
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
uh put in there so I I think you know
 
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
you can judge testimony based on the
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
accuracy of information that is given to
 
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
you and um I would I would leave it at
 
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
that but the audit you can get a copy of
 
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
I'm from the LBA and we are working on
 
00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:36.500 align:start position:0%
all of the things that
 
00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:39.260 align:start position:0%
that were identified as
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
areas of concerns in in the audit
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
and I'll leave it there thank you thank
 
00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
you commissioner okay um
 
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
Stacy Ober has her hands up from the
 
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
yes good morning thank you for this
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak in support of
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
amended house 532 the animal records
 
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
database my name is Stacy Ober I Am The
 
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
Advocate in New England for the American
 
01:00:13.849 --> 01:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
Kennel Club and can speak to you and
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
express appreciation to all the work
 
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
that the house environment and
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee did in
 
01:00:23.049 --> 01:00:23.059 align:start position:0%
collaboration with commissioner Jasper
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
we had brought forward with the New
 
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dog owners of the Granite
 
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
State Angela Ferrari had signed up to
 
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:34.140 align:start position:0%
testify but had a work obligation at 10
 
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
o'clock so I'm just jumping in uh to
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of both AKC and New
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dogs with regard to the
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
removal of the rabies vaccination fee
 
01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:47.900 align:start position:0%
and also the removal of the fee for
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
electronic health record transfers
 
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
um just by way of quick background and
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
why we support an appropriation to
 
01:01:02.089 --> 01:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
maintain the database is that those fees
 
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
in the original proposal would have
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impacted dog owners
 
01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:10.940 align:start position:0%
um when the Senate included
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
this expansion of the pet vendor license
 
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.140 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Agriculture
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
issues back in 2019 the Senate included
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
this language in the Senate budget and
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
there was no change to the requirement
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
of dog owners to obtain dog licenses
 
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
from their municipality which is an
 
01:01:31.609 --> 01:01:31.619 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism for the rabies
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
vaccination dog owners pay for those dog
 
01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:37.940 align:start position:0%
licenses and they also are required to
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
contribute money that goes into the
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
animal population fund that the state
 
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
maintains for spay neuter Services when
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
the animal records database was
 
01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
originally conceptualized the fee would
 
01:01:53.569 --> 01:01:53.579 align:start position:0%
be on dog owners again for rabies
 
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
vaccinations to now fund enamel records
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
database and also for health certificate
 
01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.990 align:start position:0%
database and also for health certificate
transfers

01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
transfers
 
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
the dog owners in New Hampshire feel as
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
though this is a disproportionate fee
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
being placed on them because arguably
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
when you look look at the scope of the
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
animal records database it includes cat
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
owners ferret owners and by virtue of
 
01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:21.559 align:start position:0%
the broad Authority initially
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
included in the database we all
 
01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
anticipated the Department of
 
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and entering the 21st
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
century would also be utilizing the
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
database for instance in monitoring
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
livestock and other health records of
 
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
other animals and therefore
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
um we were grateful to the environment
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
and AG committee for understanding uh
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
that dog owners are already paying these
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
fees this would be a duplication of fees
 
01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:50.339 align:start position:0%
and uh that it would be more appropriate
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
to yes incrementally establish the
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
database with an understanding that it
 
01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
will bring the department into the 21st
 
01:02:58.930 --> 01:02:58.940 align:start position:0%
century in a way that it can actually
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
provide for all animals domestic and
 
01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
livestock you know in in the state of
 
01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:11.220 align:start position:0%

anybody else wish to testify for or

01:09:11.809 --> 01:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Kiara dolcino I'm the
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
general counsel at the New Hampshire
 
01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:14.420 align:start position:0%
banking Department
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is at the request of the
 
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
banking Department it accomplishes a
 
01:09:23.289 --> 01:09:23.299 align:start position:0%
number of important changes to our laws
 
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
none of the changes will have an overall
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact due to the manner in which
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
the department is funded
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
any additional revenue or any cost
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
savings only operates to reduce or
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
affect the assessment that is imposed on
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
our chartered and licensed institutions
 
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
so the overall effect of the bill any
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact is really uh does not
 
01:09:51.849 --> 01:09:51.859 align:start position:0%
affect the bottom line
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
I've submitted some written testimony
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
which I hope is helpful I can go through
 
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
the bill quickly to explain how the bill
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
makes changes to our laws
 
01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
um and then I'm happy to answer any
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
questions okay if you could briefly go
 
01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:09.380 align:start position:0%
through the bill
 
01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:14.780 align:start position:0%
sure so sections one through fifteen
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
we're only concentrating on the part
 
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
that deals with the revenue okay
 
01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:23.050 align:start position:0%
that deals with the revenue okay
understood

01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:23.060 align:start position:0%
understood
 
01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
um sections one through 15 really have
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
no physical impact
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
um they're just requiring licensees to
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
register excuse me license and Report
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
through the nmls system so I won't
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
discuss that any further
 
01:10:42.169 --> 01:10:42.179 align:start position:0%
sections 16 through 19 do impose some
 
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
additional fiscal cost on our trust
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
companies these changes arose through
 
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill 98 study committee and
 
01:10:54.649 --> 01:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
would now require that any new directors
 
01:10:56.209 --> 01:10:56.219 align:start position:0%
that are appointed to a Trust Company
 
01:10:59.209 --> 01:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
undergo a background investigation and
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
bear the cost of that background
 
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
bear the cost of that background
investigation

01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh section 20 of the bill also has
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact again this was a provision
 
01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
that came out of the Senate Bill 98
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
study committee it would increase the
 
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
fee for applications for new Charters
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
new Banks trust companies or credit
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
unions from ten thousand dollars to
 
01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand dollars
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
what we were finding were that certain
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
applications were taking significant
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
amounts of time
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
um and so we felt it was appropriate to
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
have the applicant bear that cost rather
 
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
than shift that cost to all institutions
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh who would pick up the the difference
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh section 21 of the bill does not
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
really have a fiscal impact it was just
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
to clarify that institutions have to pay
 
01:11:57.410 --> 01:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
their required assessment even if they
 
01:11:59.930 --> 01:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
dissolve um during the the course of the
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
section 22
 
01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
um has modest fiscal impact and that it
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
um eliminate the need of the department
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
to calculate the interest rate for
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
escrow funds that are escrowed for
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
purposes of mortgages and paying taxes
 
01:12:20.890 --> 01:12:20.900 align:start position:0%
and insurance
 
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
that ties it to the federal funds rate
 
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
and we believe that will help reduce
 
01:12:28.450 --> 01:12:28.460 align:start position:0%
staff time at the department
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
sections finally sections 23 to 28 also
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
have some cost Savings in that we are
 
01:12:36.370 --> 01:12:36.380 align:start position:0%
requesting the ability to transmit
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints via email rather
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
than certified mail and there will be
 
01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions uh
 
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
regarding any of the bill well thank you
 
01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
for your testimony questions from the
 
01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
testimony as you're speaking
 
01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
I had a flashback was this bill did we
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
deal with this bill last year and it
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
didn't make it through the Senate yes
 
01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
sir that's correct it did actually make
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
it through the Senate some of the
 
01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
provisions were will be familiar because
 
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
a number of bills did a pass both the
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate unfortunately the
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
bill was included in the Omnibus bills
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
that went to the governor and uh was all
 
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
this the bills were ultimately vetoed
 
01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
that that that's helpful so the big
 
01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
change really is the uh
 
01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
on page six line 36
 
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
the 10 000 going to the fifteen thousand
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
correct oh and I did I'm sorry I did uh
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
forget to mention
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
um the bill would also allow the
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner to charge additional uh
 
01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.870 align:start position:0%
commissioner to charge additional uh
charges

01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
charges
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
um if in reviewing an application
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
um the even the fifteen thousand dollars
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't sufficient to cover the
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
Department's time
 
01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
um and so that provision again was
 
01:13:57.010 --> 01:13:57.020 align:start position:0%
something that you saw last year in HB
 
01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:00.179 align:start position:0%
1696 uh again it passed the House and
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
Senate and it's before you again
 
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as last year there's a
 
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
slight change that was requested by the
 
01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
chartered institutions
 
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
um just some additional language so that
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
they would have
 
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
um to discuss the notice they would
 
01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
receive if the department determined
 
01:14:21.649 --> 01:14:21.659 align:start position:0%
that their application was going to
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
exceed the fifteen thousand dollar
 
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
threshold and we need to charge
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
additional funds
 
01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
um but it just added some notice a
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
provision to let them know that was
 
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
going to occur and to give them the
 
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity to withdraw the application
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
at that time do you remember what the
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
vote was coming out of the
 
01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
Commerce committed
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
I believe it it was
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
um a park I believe there were two
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
Representatives who voted
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
um uh against the bill I believe it was
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative Sanborn and
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative Warden I'm not entirely
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
sure but I'm sure it's in the record but
 
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
otherwise it did pass okay
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
I I checked
 
01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes I have it there was I had a
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee it came out 19 to nothing this
 
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
year's bill
 
01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I thought you meant last
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
year right so last year it was that vote
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
but this year I had I checked it was 19.
 
01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
yes and it was I think it was probably
 
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
on consent calendar because it was a
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
Voice vote Yes right can I have one
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up if I know there's others who
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak but
 
01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:30.729 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak but
um

01:15:30.729 --> 01:15:30.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
so it looks like you read instead of
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
using ABCD we went to uh parentheses one
 
01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
two three four I just want to make sure
 
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
the committee understands that all these
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
other fees were already in existence
 
01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
can you just verify that
 
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
you there I'm sorry um can you uh I mean
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill now which sections
 
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
are you referring to go to page six
 
01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
uh down the bottom line start with 36
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes oh yes in in that for yes those
 
01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
those fees are all existing fees correct
 
01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
yes you just read numbered it was just
 
01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
the renumbering that correct okay
 
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
that's all I have thank you
 
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh represent Almy followed by
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you on it's still Cino do you um
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
could you please explain for our newer
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
members the
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
um way that the department of banking is
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
funded and what it would mean that
 
01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:40.940 align:start position:0%
certain uh members uh users of the bank
 
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh Department of banking on pay in if
 
01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
they pay particular things in fees or
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
fines how that relates to the total
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
funding of the banking Department yes
 
01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.490 align:start position:0%
funding of the banking Department yes
certainly

01:16:55.490 --> 01:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
um I um in my written testimony I
 
01:16:59.689 --> 01:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
explained that the department collects
 
01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
over the course of the year uh
 
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
application fees
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
um examination fees
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
um and then penalties and other costs
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
that are imposed and if there's a
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
deficiency between what we collect and
 
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
the charges the cost for running the
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
department then we impose an assessment
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
on our institutions
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
um to to collect those the deficiency so
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we are self-funded
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
we collect all funds necessary to cover
 
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:33.659 align:start position:0%
the Department's costs if we collect
 
01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue it would reduce the
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
assessment if we impose additional costs
 
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
it would reduce the assessment and if
 
01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
there's a less a cost of the department
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
to do its business then the assessment
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
is reduced so in the end it's a zero sum
 
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
game there's no overall impact to the
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
bottom line only a difference in the
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
amount of the assessment imposed
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you if I could just follow up for
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
a second
 
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
represent only go ahead just to make
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
that clear if I on a bank on
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
puts in on for work done by the
 
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
department which costs a lot more than
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
it does to anyone else on and there is
 
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
no way to pay for it in fees then all of
 
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
the banks will be paying for it correct
 
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
there's a cost shifting yes and we're
 
01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
trying to address that in this bill by
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
charging the fees that we think are
 
01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.070 align:start position:0%
charging the fees that we think are
necessary

01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
so that that cost is not shifted to the
 
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
other institutions
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative Pillsbury
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm just curious
 
01:18:47.209 --> 01:18:47.219 align:start position:0%
how for how long a time has the fee been
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
set at ten thousand
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question I'm not sure
 
01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I can look at the bill and see when
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
the last amendment was in place but I
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
believe it hasn't changed since at least
 
01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.410 align:start position:0%
believe it hasn't changed since at least
2015.

01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
2015.
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.169 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:19:08.169 --> 01:19:08.179 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
Bernstein did you have your hand up
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative I did but my question was
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
just asked okay uh representative Bronte
 
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
uh my recollection from last year was
 
01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
uh my recollection from last year was
that

01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
it was more than just a ten thousand it
 
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
seemed like it was ten thousand
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
you're assessing a new bank or a new
 
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
Credit Union
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
to initially pay ten thousand but if
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
your work took you beyond that ten
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
thousand that you would assess another
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
ten thousand is that correct
 
01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
yeah well there is a provision that says
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
if the if the new fee the fifteen
 
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars doesn't cover the cost
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
of the department staff and reviewing
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
the application then the commissioner
 
01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
will notify the institution or the
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
applicant explain that it appears that
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
the applicant has exceeded the fifteen
 
01:19:58.330 --> 01:19:58.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
fee and that we will need to start
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
charging additional cost what we find is
 
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have applicants who come to
 
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
the department who are not really
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
prepared in submitting the application
 
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
and you know we do a lot of work
 
01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
reviewing it and they have to come back
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
to us with multiple
 
01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
um business plans or multiple revisions
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
um and so you know those kinds of
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
applications take a lot of time and a
 
01:20:25.729 --> 01:20:25.739 align:start position:0%
lot of effort on the book Department's
 
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
end so the bill would permit the
 
01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
commissioner to notify the applicant
 
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
that they are now exceeding the fifteen
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar fee and that we would
 
01:20:36.649 --> 01:20:36.659 align:start position:0%
have to start charging them additional
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
costs and then at that point they would
 
01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
have the ability to either withdraw
 
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
their application or continue
 
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
with that can I do a follow-up so with
 
01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
that continuation be a time of materials
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a charge
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
um we would if you're asking how we
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
would impose the charge we would um it's
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
the based on the per diem exam fee
 
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
that's already in the law and the
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
department tracks the time spent on the
 
01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
application and we would Bill based on
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
that per DM fee
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up is it is it my
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
understanding that that was kind of the
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
practice with the 10 000 as well no the
 
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
additional charges is a new provision
 
01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
that came out of the Senate Bill 98
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
study committee okay thank you
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
tests and none rehab somebody from the
 
01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.550 align:start position:0%
tests and none rehab somebody from the
attendee

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
attendee
 
01:21:34.729 --> 01:21:34.739 align:start position:0%
uh Lee oxenham could you let me
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think she might be on for the next
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
bill but maybe we should ask her for
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
Lee oxenham uh you making a comment on
 
01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
do you have a comment for House Bill 610
 
01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.669 align:start position:0%
do you have a comment for House Bill 610
.

01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
.
 
01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
all right then anybody else have
 
01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
questions or comments on House Bill 610.
 
01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
we have nobody signed up in a position
 
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
only signed up in support and only one
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify and we just heard
 
01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:27.719 align:start position:0%
from us
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing on
 
01:23:04.090 --> 01:23:04.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the public hearing on
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 614--fm
 
01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
an act exempting the state and political
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
subdivision from payment of the cost of
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
compliance with a renewable portfolio
 
01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:28.970 align:start position:0%
compliance with a renewable portfolio
standard

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
Michael wants here
 
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
I just
 
01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
promoted him to panelists
 
01:23:39.659 --> 01:23:42.110 align:start position:0%
promoted him to panelists
good

01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Voss
 
01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
we want to introduce your bill
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you remember that
 
01:23:55.490 --> 01:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
the policy has been voted by the science
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
technology energy committee and we're
 
01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.590 align:start position:0%
technology energy committee and we're
only

01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:24:02.630 --> 01:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
listening to Pops that would affect
 
01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
revenues representative Ross
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good morning
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
honorable colleagues thanks for letting
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
me uh introduce this bill to you this
 
01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.510 align:start position:0%
me uh introduce this bill to you this
morning

01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:24:17.689 --> 01:24:17.699 align:start position:0%
I sent you a written testimony
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
um yesterday or the day before I can't
 
01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
remember exactly when
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
um so you should have that in your inbox
 
01:24:27.770 --> 01:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
that'll give you the basics on what this
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
bill does
 
01:24:31.729 --> 01:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
I'm going to skip directly to attachment
 
01:24:34.209 --> 01:24:34.219 align:start position:0%
one in my written testimony which is the
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
estimate of the financial impact of this
 
01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.430 align:start position:0%
estimate of the financial impact of this
bill

01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.930 align:start position:0%
bill
so

01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
there's a spreadsheet there that shows
 
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
the last five years of data about the
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire's
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
um electricity usage
 
01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
and you will notice that uh
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
the state has used about 76 to 77
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
million kilowatt hours of electricity
 
01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
every year from 2016 to 2019 those
 
01:25:09.169 --> 01:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
numbers came from The Office of the
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
State energy manager
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
the 2020 number which is considerably
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
higher at 105 million kilowatts actually
 
01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
came from the Public Utilities
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
Commission and their data was part of
 
01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet that they used or the
 
01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
worksheet that they used to come up with
 
01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:29.050 align:start position:0%
worksheet that they used to come up with
the

01:25:29.050 --> 01:25:29.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
Financial note for the bill
 
01:25:35.209 --> 01:25:35.219 align:start position:0%
there is a discrepancy between those
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
numbers but I was not able to get an
 
01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:41.219 align:start position:0%
explanation of that discrepancy
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
nevertheless using those numbers
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
like estimated the amount of money that
 
01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire would save by
 
01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
not paying the renewable portfolio
 
01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
standard and as you'll see under the
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
column labeled RPS
 
01:26:01.729 --> 01:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
over the last five years the state would
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
have received some would have saved
 
01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 356
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
000 to 508 thousand dollars per year
 
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
by not paying the RPS
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
just as a tangential tangential note the
 
01:26:21.169 --> 01:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
state would have saved even more by not
 
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
paying the system benefits charge
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the the average number for
 
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
the State over the last five years is
 
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
roughly four hundred thousand dollars
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
the total over the last five years is
 
01:26:36.649 --> 01:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
almost two million dollars
 
01:26:40.030 --> 01:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
so there are considerable savings to be
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh obtained by passing this bill just
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire
 
01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
and by the way for the record I used the
 
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
number in the far right hand column that
 
01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:55.390 align:start position:0%
number in the far right hand column that
is

01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
.00482 that is the reconciled number
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
that eversource uses to uh compute
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
its costs for complying with the RPS per
 
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour
 
01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
now it is true that the state does not
 
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
buy its electricity from eversource or
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
Unitil or Liberty it contracts with a
 
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
competitive or alternative supplier to
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
get its energy
 
01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
but those uh entities are not regulated
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
by the puc and they're not required to
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
Port report to the puc so I couldn't get
 
01:27:38.689 --> 01:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
exact numbers from those entities about
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
the state or any individual towns
 
01:27:44.890 --> 01:27:44.900 align:start position:0%
electricity costs so I estimated them
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
using that number from eversource which
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
came out of its latest race rate case
 
01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.669 align:start position:0%
came out of its latest race rate case
filing

01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
filing
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
if you go down a little farther on the
 
01:27:58.970 --> 01:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet I also estimated the cost
 
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
savings for a couple of our larger
 
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
cities Manchester and Nashua which based
 
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
on their electricity expenditures in
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
2019 which is data that I got from their
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
Town websites
 
01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.910 align:start position:0%
Town websites
uh

01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
Manchester could save somewhere around
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
173 thousand dollars Nashua could save
 
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 136 thousand dollars by
 
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
not paying the RPS and even my little
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
town of Epping could save somewhere
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
around nine thousand dollars by not
 
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
paying the RPS
 
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
so those are the financial financial
 
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
implications of
 
01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
passing this bill I would just like to
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
point out one other point and that is
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
that there are five Municipal
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
electricity companies in the state that
 
01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
are owned by a municipality Wolfeboro
 
01:28:54.169 --> 01:28:54.179 align:start position:0%
Lancaster and three others in the North
 
01:28:54.179 --> 01:28:55.370 align:start position:0%
Lancaster and three others in the North
country

01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
and none of those Municipal
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
electricities require their customers to
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
pay the RPS or the SBC and they do that
 
01:29:07.330 --> 01:29:07.340 align:start position:0%
to keep costs low for their uh
 
01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who are also the rate payers
 
01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
for the electricity in their towns so
 
01:29:16.729 --> 01:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
it's a concept that has a precedent and
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
a concept that has been proven to work
 
01:29:21.729 --> 01:29:21.739 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the reasons why I
 
01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill
 
01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll uh turn it over to you
 
01:29:28.970 --> 01:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
guys to ask me questions and I'll do my
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
best to answer them thank you
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on I would have
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
appreciated it if we could have had
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
those numbers up on the screen since
 
01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
yesterday was town meeting day and some
 
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
of us were way too busy to be able to
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
try and find this email but
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
um I would like to ask what you are
 
01:30:00.290 --> 01:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to do away with the
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard why didn't
 
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
you just kill it
 
01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
what is going to happen if this is still
 
01:30:11.290 --> 01:30:11.300 align:start position:0%
in place and you are removing
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
what may be ha I don't know how what
 
01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
percentage of the funding it is but
 
01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
what's left seems to be businesses and
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
and individual households
 
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
so what what is the result of removing
 
01:30:29.890 --> 01:30:29.900 align:start position:0%
the funding that is paid by
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities and uh
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
and the state and what services do the
 
01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
state and municipalities lose or do they
 
01:30:43.729 --> 01:30:43.739 align:start position:0%
still on
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
are they still eligible for the benefits
 
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
of this program thank you
 
01:30:51.890 --> 01:30:51.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative All Me for the
 
01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
questions I'll try to remember them all
 
01:30:56.990 --> 01:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh in the first place I'm not trying to
 
01:30:59.689 --> 01:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
eliminate the RPS I'm trying to save
 
01:31:02.689 --> 01:31:02.699 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money the impact on the RPS
 
01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
program from this bill will be roughly I
 
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
estimate about five million dollars a
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
year the program generates about 70
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year for renewable
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
energy so the impact on the RPS itself
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
will not be particularly great but it
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
will provide some relief for taxpayers
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
uh well cities and towns lose anything
 
01:31:30.890 --> 01:31:30.900 align:start position:0%
by not paying the RPS no they won't uh
 
01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
the RPS is
 
01:31:35.689 --> 01:31:35.699 align:start position:0%
a program that supports renewable energy
 
01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
people who already have created a
 
01:31:40.209 --> 01:31:40.219 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:42.900 align:start position:0%
generation project
 
01:31:45.290 --> 01:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
as they produce energy they collect
 
01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
renewable energy or they sell renewable
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
energy certificates and collect the
 
01:31:53.890 --> 01:31:53.900 align:start position:0%
money from that sale
 
01:31:56.689 --> 01:31:56.699 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
towns not paying for the RPS don't lose
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
anything and in fact the exemption from
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
paying the RPS reduces the electric
 
01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:13.510 align:start position:0%
supplier or producers load and
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:15.169 align:start position:0%
supplier or producers load and
[Music]

01:32:15.169 --> 01:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
requires them to buy fewer renewable
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
energy certificates
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
so the only impact will be that if you
 
01:32:22.679 --> 01:32:24.590 align:start position:0%
so the only impact will be that if you
uh

01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
a number of renewable energy
 
01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
certificates will not be required to be
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
next question
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
so the net result is that there would be
 
01:32:44.689 --> 01:32:44.699 align:start position:0%
five million less money going into the
 
01:32:44.699 --> 01:32:47.030 align:start position:0%
five million less money going into the
RPS

01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
RPS
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
which creates
 
01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:50.930 align:start position:0%
which creates
um programs

01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
um programs
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
that on are used by cities and towns and
 
01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
they will still be able to use them but
 
01:32:59.810 --> 01:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
there will be five million less dollars
 
01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
in the system
 
01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
and I would also like a comment on the
 
01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
fact that that the standard ideology of
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
your party is that if you on let the
 
01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
cities and towns have more money they're
 
01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
just going to increase spending
 
01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you once again for the question it
 
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
helps taxpayers by giving towns the
 
01:33:34.610 --> 01:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
option of lowering their property tax
 
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
rates and they can opt in to the program
 
01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
and continue paying the RPS if they want
 
01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
to with a vote of their governing body
 
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
so that gives their local taxpayers the
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
option of saying yes we want to do this
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
or no we don't want to do this we want
 
01:33:53.689 --> 01:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
to save money
 
01:33:55.850 --> 01:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
so I think that that would be a signal
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
to local uh select people and and City
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
councilors if if the citizens of the
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
community say that they want to receive
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
these savings one would hope that the
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
local officials would pass those along
 
01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:17.090 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
of Romney followed by representative
 
01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:20.330 align:start position:0%
of Romney followed by representative
Ames

01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you very
 
01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:24.290 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you very
representative

01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:34:27.169 --> 01:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
um I'm still trying to understand why we
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
have this bill
 
01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:30.290 align:start position:0%
have this bill
but

01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
um you can help me with that but will
 
01:34:35.209 --> 01:34:35.219 align:start position:0%
you say savings to taxpayers
 
01:34:38.209 --> 01:34:38.219 align:start position:0%
I understand that but how about savings
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
to rate payers
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
because of this bill
 
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't save rate payers at
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
all except for municipal uh
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
the municipality itself which is a
 
01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
ratepayer so the the city or town is a
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
ratepayer and this bill will lower their
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
electricity costs by a certain amount
 
01:35:06.169 --> 01:35:06.179 align:start position:0%
and as a result uh taxpayers will
 
01:35:06.179 --> 01:35:07.970 align:start position:0%
and as a result uh taxpayers will
potentially

01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:09.229 align:start position:0%
potentially
uh

01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
have to spend less money to to run their
 
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
government operations so that's how that
 
01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.129 --> 01:35:25.139 align:start position:0%
your mood is the
 
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
decade got it sorry to be slow on that
 
01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:30.950 align:start position:0%
decade got it sorry to be slow on that
um

01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
so I want to inquire about the
 
01:35:38.290 --> 01:35:38.300 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
that in effect
 
01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
those who are energy suppliers supplying
 
01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
to the state or political subdivision
 
01:35:51.610 --> 01:35:51.620 align:start position:0%
that has not opted out
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
will no longer have to make
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:03.179 align:start position:0%
um that in my mind is affecting
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
um essentially a fee or revenues that
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise would flow into a state
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
agency's fund the renewable energy fund
 
01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
so I think it's pertinent to our review
 
01:36:19.729 --> 01:36:19.739 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
um so um then my question to you
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative votes to start with I've
 
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
got a series of questions really is if
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
you consider
 
01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.890 align:start position:0%
you consider
to

01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
competitive let's call them let's just
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
focus on the competitive electricity
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
suppliers that Supply the state
 
01:36:39.610 --> 01:36:39.620 align:start position:0%
with its energy
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
one of which
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
has installed and invested money over
 
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
the years in
 
01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:48.169 align:start position:0%
the years in
[Music]

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:48.179 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:48.179 --> 01:36:50.629 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
um forms of energy that conform to that
 
01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:56.390 align:start position:0%
um forms of energy that conform to that
enable

01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
enable
 
01:36:59.689 --> 01:36:59.699 align:start position:0%
it to earn renewable energy certificates
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
or wrecks
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
and so when at times time comes to uh
 
01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
even up with the state it it
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
points to its wrecks and it meets its
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
its renewable portfolio standard
 
01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:19.940 align:start position:0%
um and then a second
 
01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
electricity supplier
 
01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
that hasn't done that that hasn't made
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
investments in its plant hasn't
 
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
developed let's say the solar field that
 
01:37:31.570 --> 01:37:31.580 align:start position:0%
that other
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
supplier is using to supply to build up
 
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
its us
 
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
supply of energy at sourcing of energy
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
its generation of energy
 
01:37:46.129 --> 01:37:46.139 align:start position:0%
um so it this other energy supplier
 
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
hasn't done that it has no racks it it
 
01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:50.470 align:start position:0%
hasn't done that it has no racks it it
it

01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
can purchase the wrecks or it can pay an
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance fund uh payment
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
into the energy fund
 
01:38:04.570 --> 01:38:04.580 align:start position:0%
um and now it's going to be exempt
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
and under this bill if this bill is
 
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
enacted so we go look forward to next
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
year when it's all in place
 
01:38:15.110 --> 01:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
and the first
 
01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
supplier that has put money into
 
01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
its own plant
 
01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:23.709 align:start position:0%
its own plant
um

01:38:23.709 --> 01:38:23.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
continues to carry those costs
 
01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
and really gains nothing from this
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
exemption other than
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
um well maybe it gains nothing uh let's
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
leave it at that the other supplier
 
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
is now
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
has an exception
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
and under the bill it negotiates reduced
 
01:38:50.209 --> 01:38:50.219 align:start position:0%
rates uh to reflect that so it's going
 
01:38:53.890 --> 01:38:53.900 align:start position:0%
to now be under bidding the first
 
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
electrics of supplier that all of this
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
strikes me as unfair
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
and unreasonable
 
01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that complicated
 
01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
question so competitive suppliers don't
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
receive any kind of an exemption under
 
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.270 align:start position:0%
receive any kind of an exemption under
this

01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
legislation the only entities that
 
01:39:21.649 --> 01:39:21.659 align:start position:0%
receive an exemption are political
 
01:39:21.659 --> 01:39:23.149 align:start position:0%
receive an exemption are political
subdivisions

01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
01:39:23.159 --> 01:39:24.649 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
so

01:39:24.649 --> 01:39:24.659 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
let's use my town of Epping as an
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
example let's say today we're spending
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh two hundred and twenty thousand
 
01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
we buy our electricity from eversource
 
01:39:39.610 --> 01:39:39.620 align:start position:0%
we don't use a competitive supplier but
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
under this bill that bill would be
 
01:39:42.719 --> 01:39:44.090 align:start position:0%
under this bill that bill would be
reduced

01:39:44.090 --> 01:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
by eight thousand dollars roughly or
 
01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
nine thousand dollars based on the fact
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
that the uh the company would no longer
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
charge us for the RPS portion of their
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
rate they would subtract that before
 
01:40:01.610 --> 01:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
they charged the town of Epping
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
and that's how the system works it's
 
01:40:06.169 --> 01:40:06.179 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually fairly simple
 
01:40:08.930 --> 01:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
with regard to your comment about uh
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
alternative compliant compliance
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
payments and the sale of wrecks
 
01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
neither of those things would be
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill
 
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments are
 
01:40:24.649 --> 01:40:24.659 align:start position:0%
purchased by energy suppliers
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
if there are no wrecks to purchase
 
01:40:29.450 --> 01:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
if there are wrecks to purchase they
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
purchase wrecks instead but if they if
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
this the system runs out of Rex then
 
01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:37.739 align:start position:0%
they'll purchase alternative compliant
 
01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
they'll make alternative compliance
 
01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:40.550 align:start position:0%
they'll make alternative compliance
payments

01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:40:42.590 --> 01:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
and those payments don't do go to the
 
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
renewable energy of fund but none of
 
01:40:47.149 --> 01:40:47.159 align:start position:0%
that is impacted by this legislation
 
01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
that's a completely separate uh
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
operation that happens outside the
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
purview of what's going on here this is
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
a simple exemption of political
 
01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
subdivisions from paying the RPS portion
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
of the Energy Service rate that they
 
01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
would normally be charged by their
 
01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:13.270 align:start position:0%
would normally be charged by their
supplier

01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.430 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
representings you have any thoughts yes
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
sir I think I'm are you hearing me
 
01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you are
 
01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:25.310 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you are
um

01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I I first I'd say that
 
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
this is complex stuff and I hope that
 
01:41:34.129 --> 01:41:34.139 align:start position:0%
we'll have a little time in uh reviewing
 
01:41:36.169 --> 01:41:36.179 align:start position:0%
this bill in a work session so that we
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
can take it
 
01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
more than we can here through a few
 
01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:42.290 align:start position:0%
more than we can here through a few
questions

01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:41:45.649 --> 01:41:45.659 align:start position:0%
um but uh I I guess my follow-up
 
01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
question is uh isn't the renewable
 
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
energy fund going to lose money
 
01:41:53.810 --> 01:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
um is the result of this bill
 
01:41:56.930 --> 01:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
in other words there will be I believe
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
the entirety of the renewable energy
 
01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:01.139 align:start position:0%
fund comes from alternative compliance
 
01:42:01.139 --> 01:42:02.149 align:start position:0%
fund comes from alternative compliance
payments

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:42:04.609 --> 01:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
and will there not be less money because
 
01:42:07.010 --> 01:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question actually the
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund gets
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
most of its funding from alternative
 
01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:15.659 align:start position:0%
compliance payments but it gets some
 
01:42:18.649 --> 01:42:18.659 align:start position:0%
funding elsewhere as well and the answer
 
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
to your question is uh
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
in recent experience there have not been
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
very many alternative compliance
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
payments made to this to the renewable
 
01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
energy fund simply because there have
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
been plenty of wrecks for producers to
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
buy so there hasn't been a need for
 
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
making alternative compliance payments
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that would be
 
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
decreased by this program would be
 
01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
extremely small
 
01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
as far as alternative compliance
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
payments are concerned it's hard to
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
estimate it exactly but if the whole
 
01:42:57.129 --> 01:42:57.139 align:start position:0%
program only
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
decreases RPS intake by 5 million
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
alternative client compliance payments
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
are a small fraction of that so it would
 
01:43:07.199 --> 01:43:08.149 align:start position:0%
are a small fraction of that so it would
be

01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
a very small amount
 
01:43:13.490 --> 01:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to leave it at that
 
01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
um representative can you uh
 
01:43:22.090 --> 01:43:22.100 align:start position:0%
provide the committee we were bulletize
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh explanation of the questions and your
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
response because this is complicated
 
01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
so if you could provide the committee
 
01:43:34.090 --> 01:43:34.100 align:start position:0%
with a bulletized
 
01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh summary of the questions and response
 
01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay I'll try I didn't take notes so I
 
01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
can't promise that I'll remember what
 
01:43:49.250 --> 01:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
all the questions were but
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
um I'll do my best thank you
 
01:43:57.490 --> 01:43:57.500 align:start position:0%
uh I noticed in the attendees as early
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
oxhamp has her hand up no Norm you got
 
01:44:02.689 --> 01:44:02.699 align:start position:0%
you got some questions still from the
 
01:44:02.699 --> 01:44:05.810 align:start position:0%
you got some questions still from the
members

01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:09.290 --> 01:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
all right uh yes representative hacken
 
01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:12.109 align:start position:0%
all right uh yes representative hacken
Phillips

01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
here and uh thank you representative
 
01:44:16.729 --> 01:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
boss for or Bose excuse me if I'm
 
01:44:18.290 --> 01:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
mispronouncing your name
 
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
um for testifying this morning
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill and um giving us
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
kind of an introduction of what we can
 
01:44:25.679 --> 01:44:26.990 align:start position:0%
kind of an introduction of what we can
expect

01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
expect
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
um just as a point of um following up on
 
01:44:32.209 --> 01:44:32.219 align:start position:0%
your last question this is being
 
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
recorded So I think you can go back and
 
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
take a look at you know the
 
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
conversations that we're having
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
but if I if I understand correctly your
 
01:44:41.209 --> 01:44:41.219 align:start position:0%
last statement is that you know buy your
 
01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
estimates there's gonna be about a five
 
01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:43.860 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
01:44:46.129 --> 01:44:46.139 align:start position:0%
you know decrease in revenues for the
 
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
fund as a result of this legislative
 
01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:50.510 align:start position:0%
fund as a result of this legislative
change

01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
um and you're saying that's a small
 
01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.450 align:start position:0%
um and you're saying that's a small
fraction

01:44:53.450 --> 01:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
fraction
 
01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:54.129 align:start position:0%
fraction
um

01:44:54.129 --> 01:44:54.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know kind of the overall programming
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh that's being expended here out of the
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
fund so my question is that
 
01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:05.219 align:start position:0%
you know my understanding is that the
 
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire has to
 
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
demonstrate its willingness to be
 
01:45:12.169 --> 01:45:12.179 align:start position:0%
investing in types of programs to
 
01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
address our transition to Renewables in
 
01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
order to you know receive matching or
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
other sources of funding from federal
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
levels as well as you know private
 
01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
organizations and if if we have a five
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
million dollar decrease
 
01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
um how is that going to affect our
 
01:45:31.729 --> 01:45:31.739 align:start position:0%
eligibility for receiving those matching
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
grants moving forward
 
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh just to
 
01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:41.219 align:start position:0%
clarify what I said was that uh
 
01:45:43.729 --> 01:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
a decrease in alternative compliance
 
01:45:46.970 --> 01:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
payments to the program would be a small
 
01:45:51.169 --> 01:45:51.179 align:start position:0%
percentage of the total RPS program not
 
01:45:57.169 --> 01:45:57.179 align:start position:0%
uh a small percentage of the 5 million
 
01:45:59.209 --> 01:45:59.219 align:start position:0%
although it would also be a small
 
01:46:02.450 --> 01:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
percentage of the 5 million uh to answer
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
your question as far as I know there is
 
01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
no dependence on the RPS program and any
 
01:46:13.850 --> 01:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
kinds of federal or or other
 
01:46:17.689 --> 01:46:17.699 align:start position:0%
funding that the state might obtain uh
 
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
about renewable energy so there's
 
01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
nothing certainly in the rsas about the
 
01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
RPS program that indicates that it has
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
to stay at a certain level in order to
 
01:46:33.169 --> 01:46:33.179 align:start position:0%
receive to be eligible for federal
 
01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
funding there's nothing in the
 
01:46:39.169 --> 01:46:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh just as a follow-up
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh no I I think maybe we're just talking
 
01:46:46.669 --> 01:46:46.679 align:start position:0%
past each other a little bit I think
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's eligibility requirements of
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
alternate sources of funding to be
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
applied towards renewable energy
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
programs if our state can also
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that we're you know putting
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
forth an effort to a certain threshold
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
and my question is does this legislation
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
change our ability to meet that
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
threshold for matching funds
 
01:47:10.370 --> 01:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware that there is any such
 
01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:11.930 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware that there is any such
threshold

01:47:11.930 --> 01:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
01:47:15.649 --> 01:47:15.659 align:start position:0%
um but if you can show me that there is
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
such a threshold I'll take a look at
 
01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:18.290 align:start position:0%
such a threshold I'll take a look at
that

01:47:18.290 --> 01:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:26.570 align:start position:0%
 
um representative

01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:30.530 --> 01:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
so is in your muted sorry this is uh
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
fairly new to me but
 
01:47:33.659 --> 01:47:36.350 align:start position:0%
fairly new to me but
um if

01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
um if
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
the the the money that goes into this
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
fund is mostly from
 
01:47:44.159 --> 01:47:46.010 align:start position:0%
fund is mostly from
on

01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:47.330 align:start position:0%
on
from

01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
the uh what do you call those things on
 
01:47:51.119 --> 01:47:52.729 align:start position:0%
the uh what do you call those things on
the

01:47:52.729 --> 01:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
the purchase of the
 
01:47:58.010 --> 01:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
um certificates
 
01:47:58.020 --> 01:48:00.229 align:start position:0%
um certificates
and

01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:02.450 --> 01:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh the wrecks
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
and this money and then if there aren't
 
01:48:09.590 --> 01:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
enough wrecks people are are paying for
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
the alternative energy
 
01:48:11.639 --> 01:48:15.950 align:start position:0%
the alternative energy
uh

01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.490 --> 01:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
energy uh certificate or whatever it is
 
01:48:21.530 --> 01:48:21.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:48:23.209 --> 01:48:23.219 align:start position:0%
um then
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't these be replaceable between
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
themselves within a budget that on
 
01:48:31.729 --> 01:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
people are either paying for one
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
entities are either paying for one or
 
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
for the other and
 
01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:37.370 align:start position:0%
for the other and
um

01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:41.570 --> 01:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
I'm when you were calculating the 5
 
01:48:45.649 --> 01:48:45.659 align:start position:0%
million were you including the effect on
 
01:48:48.590 --> 01:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
not paying for
 
01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:50.030 align:start position:0%
not paying for
the

01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:51.770 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:48:51.770 --> 01:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
um the wreck
 
01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.970 align:start position:0%
um the wreck
in

01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:48:58.609 --> 01:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
in consideration of what was going to be
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
lost or or were you
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
maybe this is in your testimony I'm
 
01:49:05.810 --> 01:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
sorry but it came yesterday afternoon I
 
01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
think and I was erect by the evening
 
01:49:11.810 --> 01:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question yeah I think
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of us were wrecks by yesterday
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
evening uh
 
01:49:18.530 --> 01:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'll try to answer the two questions uh
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
the latter question
 
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:24.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
I've already forgotten
 
01:49:30.590 --> 01:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
you asked what is the impact okay so the
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
way the RPS program works is if I own a
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:38.030 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
facility

01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:49:41.689 --> 01:49:41.699 align:start position:0%
I generate so many megawatt hours of
 
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
electricity during the course of a year
 
01:49:48.370 --> 01:49:48.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm allowed to claim or to to
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
acquire one renewable energy certificate
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
for every one megawatt hour of
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
electricity that I sell so let's say I
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
sell 100 of them at the end of the year
 
01:50:00.890 --> 01:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
I can sell those
 
01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates on a kind
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
of an open market
 
01:50:07.129 --> 01:50:07.139 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of people out there
 
01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
who will buy them
 
01:50:11.709 --> 01:50:11.719 align:start position:0%
let's say the price for one of those uh
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
certificates is 25 dollars so I can sell
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
my 100 renewable energy certificates for
 
01:50:23.689 --> 01:50:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:28.090 --> 01:50:28.100 align:start position:0%
if there are not enough buyers out there
 
01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
who want to buy these certificates and
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
energy suppliers are the ones that buy
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
them like utility companies
 
01:50:37.790 --> 01:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
if they're not enough certificates out
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
there for them to buy then they have to
 
01:50:42.590 --> 01:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
make an alternative compliance payment
 
01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh instead and that money goes to the
 
01:50:49.070 --> 01:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund which is managed
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
by the puc
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
so that's the way the system works and
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh this legislation that I've proposed
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
here today won't have a significant
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
impact on
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
either aspect of the program because the
 
01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
program generates around 70 million
 
01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
dollars a year and this the exemptions
 
01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:16.860 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about will only reduce
 
01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:18.229 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about will only reduce
the

01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:21.169 --> 01:51:21.179 align:start position:0%
Financial impact on the whole program by
 
01:51:23.930 --> 01:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
no more than five million dollars
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned at the beginning of
 
01:51:27.169 --> 01:51:27.179 align:start position:0%
my testimony there are already five
 
01:51:30.890 --> 01:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
communities in the state that don't
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
participate in the program so it's not
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%
like it's an unprecedented program
 
01:51:40.010 --> 01:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you also could I just have a a
 
01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
short follow-up if I can on follow-up
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um if we are allowing
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
some places to opt out
 
01:51:59.930 --> 01:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
and they can
 
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
still take advantage of the program
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
on then
 
01:52:10.609 --> 01:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
isn't that unfair to everybody else that
 
01:52:13.490 --> 01:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
can't opt out as I recall there there's
 
01:52:16.970 --> 01:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
one on Electric Cooperative in the North
 
01:52:20.330 --> 01:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
country that's fairly close to us and
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
they did opt out but they also through
 
01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
their shareholders the towns that are
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
involved they have voted to carry out a
 
01:52:33.290 --> 01:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
number of alternative energy programs on
 
01:52:34.729 --> 01:52:34.739 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:52:38.990 --> 01:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
so that one seems to be separated off
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
from the general program of the state
 
01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like what you're saying is
 
01:52:48.169 --> 01:52:48.179 align:start position:0%
that the others that would opt out now
 
01:52:51.709 --> 01:52:51.719 align:start position:0%
would would still be part of the general
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
energy program of the state
 
01:52:57.649 --> 01:52:57.659 align:start position:0%
can you clarify for us thank you
 
01:53:00.830 --> 01:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
sure thank you I I think you're maybe
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
over complicating this question it's a
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
simple question really do you want to
 
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
give cities and towns the chance to
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
reduce their or the opportunity to
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
reduce their electricity costs
 
01:53:15.609 --> 01:53:15.619 align:start position:0%
which would then enable them to
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
pass those savings along to their
 
01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that's that's the simple
 
01:53:23.290 --> 01:53:23.300 align:start position:0%
question here
 
01:53:26.530 --> 01:53:26.540 align:start position:0%
its effect on the renewable portfolios
 
01:53:30.770 --> 01:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
standard is not particularly great yes
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
it will reduce it some small amount but
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's not an amount that is significant
 
01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:41.209 align:start position:0%
it's not an amount that is significant
and

01:53:41.209 --> 01:53:41.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned taxpayer relief
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
as the governor indicated in his budget
 
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
address earlier this year is a more
 
01:53:54.129 --> 01:53:54.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else wish to testify I wish
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:04.850 --> 01:54:04.860 align:start position:0%
then we will go to the representative
 
01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:07.370 align:start position:0%
then we will go to the representative
yeah

01:54:07.370 --> 01:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
okay who does
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
oh okay I didn't say your name uh go
 
01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
ahead represent names
 
01:54:18.770 --> 01:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
you're just focus in on that last
 
01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
comment about uh
 
01:54:21.239 --> 01:54:21.890 align:start position:0%
comment about uh
um

01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:25.010 --> 01:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
savings at the municipal level
 
01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:25.729 align:start position:0%
savings at the municipal level
um

01:54:25.729 --> 01:54:25.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
isn't it the case that many
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities have taken advantage of
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund to make
 
01:54:35.410 --> 01:54:35.420 align:start position:0%
investments that have lowered their
 
01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
annual consumption of electricity so
 
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
that uh in effect there these
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities and others that may
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
benefit in the future from a healthy
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
robust renewable energy fund or in fact
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
saving more than they uh will save
 
01:54:53.689 --> 01:54:53.699 align:start position:0%
through uh through your proposal
 
01:54:53.699 --> 01:54:56.030 align:start position:0%
through uh through your proposal
Representatives

01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that question and the
 
01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is this
 
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
legislation gives towns the option of
 
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
continuing to pay into the renewable
 
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:09.659 align:start position:0%
energy fund and continuing to take
 
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of the grant opportunities
 
01:55:15.070 --> 01:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
that the renewable energy fund may offer
 
01:55:21.169 --> 01:55:21.179 align:start position:0%
uh the town has to vote to opt into the
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
program again because it's an opt-out
 
01:55:27.169 --> 01:55:27.179 align:start position:0%
program by default but the option is
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
there so if local taxpayers want to
 
01:55:33.310 --> 01:55:33.320 align:start position:0%
participate in the RPS program they can
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh they can do so by instructing their
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
governor governing body to opt them back
 
01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:50.810 align:start position:0%
 
representations

01:55:50.810 --> 01:55:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.169 --> 01:55:54.179 align:start position:0%
so that's interesting so could you
 
01:55:56.450 --> 01:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
clarify uh I don't see it in the
 
01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
legislation if a municipality
 
01:56:04.970 --> 01:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:07.070 --> 01:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which is opted in or opt
 
01:56:10.729 --> 01:56:10.739 align:start position:0%
out this chooses to take advantage of
 
01:56:13.070 --> 01:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
the exemption
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
does that mean that they cannot receive
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
a grant from the renewable energy fund
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
or and in parallel if a state agency
 
01:56:23.639 --> 01:56:24.370 align:start position:0%
or and in parallel if a state agency
um

01:56:24.370 --> 01:56:24.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
wants to go forward with a renewable
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
energy funded project to get a rebate of
 
01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
some sort
 
01:56:35.450 --> 01:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
um does uh the fact that it the state
 
01:56:38.169 --> 01:56:38.179 align:start position:0%
gets this exemption meaning that that
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
project uh is no longer eligible for the
 
01:56:43.970 --> 01:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund again I don't see
 
01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that question yes it's
 
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
in um
 
01:56:57.649 --> 01:56:57.659 align:start position:0%
the paragraph I think it's uh I don't
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
have it right in front of me but I think
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
it's paragraph e it uh states that this
 
01:57:06.590 --> 01:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
is an opt-out program so that when it
 
01:57:09.490 --> 01:57:09.500 align:start position:0%
when it takes effect communities are all
 
01:57:12.290 --> 01:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
automatically automatically Exempted
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
from paying the RPS but they can opt
 
01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
back in by a vote of their governing
 
01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:19.910 align:start position:0%
back in by a vote of their governing
body

01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:57:24.350 --> 01:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
so that's how the program works and yes
 
01:57:26.689 --> 01:57:26.699 align:start position:0%
you are correct they do have to opt back
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
in in order to be eligible to uh request
 
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
grants from the new renewable energy
 
01:57:35.470 --> 01:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
fund but that option is there for them
 
01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
so voters in a town can make that
 
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:57:47.570 --> 01:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd like to leave it there
 
01:57:50.089 --> 01:57:50.099 align:start position:0%
representative major but again I think
 
01:57:52.729 --> 01:57:52.739 align:start position:0%
this is uh there are details here and
 
01:57:55.250 --> 01:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
complexities that need to be reviewed in
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
a work session
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay there is one of trendy that's on
 
01:58:04.129 --> 01:58:04.139 align:start position:0%
the list uh it's an opposition so Jimmy
 
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
could you let
 
01:58:08.570 --> 01:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
I just promoted her representative
 
01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:10.870 align:start position:0%
I just promoted her representative
oxenham

01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
oxenham
 
01:58:13.689 --> 01:58:13.699 align:start position:0%
Lee Oxford
 
01:58:21.410 --> 01:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative oxen
 
01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:30.229 align:start position:0%
okay representative oxen
uh

01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:32.930 --> 01:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
you're in opposition you're all set to
 
01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:36.290 align:start position:0%
you're in opposition you're all set to
testify

01:58:36.290 --> 01:58:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.290 --> 01:58:47.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:50.810 --> 01:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
I don't have that capability to unmute
 
01:58:50.820 --> 01:58:52.250 align:start position:0%
I don't have that capability to unmute
someone

01:58:52.250 --> 01:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I think we lost her I don't oh no
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
she's still there just everything just
 
01:59:00.589 --> 01:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
shifted I think she's trying to connect
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:23.330 --> 01:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
I don't see her in his attendees are in
 
01:59:26.689 --> 01:59:26.699 align:start position:0%
the floor uh no I think I think she got
 
01:59:26.699 --> 01:59:29.030 align:start position:0%
the floor uh no I think I think she got
dropped

01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
dropped
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
maybe she'll try to come back
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
or comments
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
I don't see anything from the
 
01:59:43.970 --> 01:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
participate the panelists I'm sorry
 
01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh representative
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
I think it would be helpful if we could
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
get someone from the program I presume
 
01:59:55.850 --> 01:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
it's under the puc
 
01:59:58.189 --> 01:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
to talk with us about this at a work
 
01:59:58.199 --> 01:59:59.209 align:start position:0%
to talk with us about this at a work
session

01:59:59.209 --> 01:59:59.219 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
right and thank you and represent oxen
 
02:00:06.410 --> 02:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
can join us at a work session if you
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
can't come back right away
 
02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:14.990 align:start position:0%
can't come back right away
um

02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh actually there's a Diane Martin with
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:33.709 --> 02:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
you have to unmute yourself there you go
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
Diane Martin
 
02:00:37.970 --> 02:00:37.980 align:start position:0%

Public Utilities Commission I just I'm
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
on for the next hearing but overheard
 
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
you say that it would be helpful to have
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
someone from the puc on a work session
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to say we'd be happy to do
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
that fine thank you
 
02:00:59.089 --> 02:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
all right any
 
02:01:04.370 --> 02:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
we are running well over time
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
so I don't see any other hands raised so
 
02:01:10.089 --> 02:01:10.099 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing on
 
02:01:16.370 --> 02:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:19.490 --> 02:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
okay well she popped in and then
 
02:01:22.850 --> 02:01:22.860 align:start position:0%
she must be having a lot of trouble yeah
 
02:01:25.250 --> 02:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
she's there she's still there
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't been promoted yet well it takes a
 
02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:47.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:01:47.629 --> 02:01:47.639 align:start position:0%

02:01:50.930 --> 02:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
yeah she's here she's on the second page
 
02:02:12.649 --> 02:02:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.659 --> 02:02:13.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:15.709 --> 02:02:15.719 align:start position:0%
you know what we'll do and she'll just
 
02:02:17.149 --> 02:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
have to join us
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
on the work session because we are way
 
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
behind okay
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
oh oh well she has her hand up but
 
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
can you unmutely we we only
 
02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.629 --> 02:02:41.639 align:start position:0%
Gen 4 is there a way to unmute her I
 
02:02:44.089 --> 02:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
don't know how I mean I don't have that
 
02:02:44.099 --> 02:02:50.689 align:start position:0%
don't know how I mean I don't have that
capability

02:02:50.689 --> 02:02:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:50.699 --> 02:02:57.609 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:02:57.609 --> 02:02:57.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
will probably have to contact Jen she's
 
02:03:02.209 --> 02:03:02.219 align:start position:0%
watching two two committees today yeah
 
02:03:02.219 --> 02:03:03.250 align:start position:0%

yeah

02:03:03.250 --> 02:03:03.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
well I guess
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
maybe what um
 
02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:09.830 align:start position:0%
maybe what um
yeah

02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%

02:03:12.410 --> 02:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
oh there she is she's unmuted
 
02:03:14.109 --> 02:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
but we can't hear you
 
02:03:18.050 --> 02:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
that's it right representative oxen
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
hey Jenny just to make a clarification
 
02:03:26.689 --> 02:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
she actually isn't connected to audio it
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
said she tried and then yeah like that
 
02:03:31.609 --> 02:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
she's trying to connect and then she her
 
02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
audio there you go now she is oh now
 
02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
oh boy Tiana is she on a phone or is
 
02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
this Earth connection
 
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
um it's not a phone number hello can you
 
02:03:52.129 --> 02:03:52.139 align:start position:0%
hear there we go yes oh my Lord I
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
apologize profusely that it has taken me
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
so much of your time for me to get on I
 
02:03:59.810 --> 02:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
will submit written testimony I will I
 
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
will keep my remarks to one minute
 
02:04:05.209 --> 02:04:05.219 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that you have had a fair
 
02:04:06.770 --> 02:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
and accurate
 
02:04:09.649 --> 02:04:09.659 align:start position:0%
description of how this is going to
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
impact our towns and our municipalities
 
02:04:15.709 --> 02:04:15.719 align:start position:0%
nor our ability to profit by all of the
 
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
federal funding that's going to be
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
coming to States in our region who are
 
02:04:21.290 --> 02:04:21.300 align:start position:0%
pursuing aggressive renewable energy
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
strategies and I I do not think it's
 
02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
fair to characterize this as a simple
 
02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
process it is complex and I I know that
 
02:04:32.570 --> 02:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative votes will do his best to
 
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
answer your questions and I will too
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you I do apologize and we will be
 
02:04:40.370 --> 02:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
having a work session so if you could
 
02:04:43.129 --> 02:04:43.139 align:start position:0%
send us that your testimony that would
 
02:04:46.370 --> 02:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
be appreciated I certainly shall
 
02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:51.890 --> 02:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
let me try this once again
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
any new person wants to testify for or
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
against house bill 614. I do not
 
02:05:04.250 --> 02:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
now you're muted representation I just
 
02:05:09.649 --> 02:05:09.659 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask uh representative oxenham
 
02:05:12.770 --> 02:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
a question but she may not be able to
 
02:05:15.229 --> 02:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
answer it at this point uh which is
 
02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
whether she believes that there is
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
language in in the statute or in this
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
bill that uh says that Townsend cities
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
that do not uh that opt not to pay the
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh renewable energy uh fee are going to
 
02:05:40.729 --> 02:05:40.739 align:start position:0%
lose the ability to use the renewable
 
02:05:43.070 --> 02:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
energy funding
 
02:05:44.930 --> 02:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for the question
 
02:05:47.149 --> 02:05:47.159 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding that we
 
02:05:49.250 --> 02:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
discussed this in our committee and we
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
actually had an amendment produced to
 
02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
ensure that there could not be a
 
02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
possibility of double dipping if towns
 
02:05:57.890 --> 02:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
were not paying in they could not access
 
02:06:01.490 --> 02:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund uh if that
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
this bill would make it so that
 
02:06:05.209 --> 02:06:05.219 align:start position:0%
everybody is out unless they
 
02:06:09.109 --> 02:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
affirmatively enter in and so
 
02:06:12.050 --> 02:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
anyone who has opted out without
 
02:06:14.330 --> 02:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
possibly even knowing it is going to be
 
02:06:16.850 --> 02:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
unable to access the renewable energy
 
02:06:21.169 --> 02:06:21.179 align:start position:0%
fund and just as a final note there we
 
02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
have no fossil fuel Energy System
 
02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
um energy suppliers here in New
 
02:06:29.570 --> 02:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's all important we spend
 
02:06:31.729 --> 02:06:31.739 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars and send them out of
 
02:06:34.129 --> 02:06:34.139 align:start position:0%
state every year we have a thriving
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
renewable energy sector which is poised
 
02:06:39.290 --> 02:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
to grow and we may be able to get
 
02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
substantial Federal funding this year if
 
02:06:47.450 --> 02:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
we are seen as active participants in
 
02:06:49.550 --> 02:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
assisting our renewable energy sector
 
02:06:52.250 --> 02:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
and I think that representative hacken
 
02:06:53.570 --> 02:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
Phillips is correct that we would be
 
02:06:56.270 --> 02:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
endangering that if if this bill were to
 
02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:58.189 align:start position:0%
endangering that if if this bill were to
pass

02:06:58.189 --> 02:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:07:00.649 --> 02:07:00.659 align:start position:0%
but I thought there was an amendment
 
02:07:03.669 --> 02:07:03.679 align:start position:0%
produced is it in this bill
 
02:07:06.770 --> 02:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
I I believe the bill as it came to you
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
should and have Incorporated that uh
 
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:11.219 align:start position:0%
Amendment perhaps we could ask chairman
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
Vose as it was his Amendment as I recall
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:25.609 --> 02:07:25.619 align:start position:0%
you need to unmute uh representing both
 
02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
sorry I was just looking on the general
 
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
court website and the amendment is there
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
but it's not part of the bill that comes
 
02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
up when you click on the bill itself so
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
apparently the two haven't been merged
 
02:07:43.310 --> 02:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
together yet well the copy I have says
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look right to me but I'll
 
02:07:50.750 --> 02:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
double check again I just took a quick
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
look while we were online here I'll I'll
 
02:07:58.129 --> 02:07:58.139 align:start position:0%
get back to you I'll take another look
 
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
thank you on another question with that
 
02:08:04.490 --> 02:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
one is the state also unable to access
 
02:08:08.209 --> 02:08:08.219 align:start position:0%
if the state opts out which I gather the
 
02:08:10.250 --> 02:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
bill opposite out
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
that would be a consequence of passing
 
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:08:24.770 --> 02:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I just I want to
 
02:08:27.530 --> 02:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
follow up on that discussion
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
um I hope that somebody will explain to
 
02:08:33.129 --> 02:08:33.139 align:start position:0%
us how the bill as amended by the house
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
indeed accomplishes what has just been
 
02:08:36.239 --> 02:08:38.089 align:start position:0%
indeed accomplishes what has just been
said

02:08:38.089 --> 02:08:38.099 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:08:41.930 --> 02:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
um about it that it uh that the state
 
02:08:44.570 --> 02:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the bill and political
 
02:08:46.910 --> 02:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that
 
02:08:50.089 --> 02:08:50.099 align:start position:0%
that are not going to be participating
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
in uh in the RPS
 
02:08:56.089 --> 02:08:56.099 align:start position:0%
system are going to take advantage of
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
this exemption
 
02:09:01.010 --> 02:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
um will be excluded from participating
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund I just want to
 
02:09:05.149 --> 02:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
be I don't I don't see it in the
 
02:09:07.609 --> 02:09:07.619 align:start position:0%
language and maybe I'm missing something
 
02:09:09.530 --> 02:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
so if
 
02:09:12.770 --> 02:09:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative boss would be prepared to
 
02:09:15.050 --> 02:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
come up with an answer for that for our
 
02:09:19.850 --> 02:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
and representative spillsbury
 
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
yes for you then yes
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
just to clarify on the house session
 
02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
last a week before
 
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
um the amendment was adopted on a Voice
 
02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:37.250 align:start position:0%
um the amendment was adopted on a Voice
vote

02:09:37.250 --> 02:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:09:40.729 --> 02:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
and then the bill was
 
02:09:40.739 --> 02:09:42.410 align:start position:0%
and then the bill was
otpa

02:09:42.410 --> 02:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
otpa
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
at 198 150. so I assume that's the same
 
02:09:47.810 --> 02:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative is
 
02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:49.010 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative is
describing

02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
describing
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I've seen that amendment I I
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
think we just need to
 
02:09:56.570 --> 02:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
I need anyway to be educated on its
 
02:09:56.580 --> 02:10:00.830 align:start position:0%
I need anyway to be educated on its
impact

02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:02.930 align:start position:0%
 
anything

02:10:02.930 --> 02:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:10:05.169 --> 02:10:05.179 align:start position:0%
because we are going to the work session
 
02:10:08.689 --> 02:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
to address these issues
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
send nothing I was say no more hands up
 
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to close the public hearing
 
02:10:26.750 --> 02:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
were any other members of the public
 
02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
unable to get into this session if may I
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
not that we know of well in the work
 
02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:41.689 align:start position:0%
not that we know of well in the work
session

02:10:41.689 --> 02:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
I I believe there were others who
 
02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
attempted to sign in and wanted to
 
02:10:47.689 --> 02:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
testify that's why I raised the question
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:52.609 --> 02:10:52.619 align:start position:0%
I looked at the attendees there's nobody
 
02:10:52.619 --> 02:10:53.629 align:start position:0%
I looked at the attendees there's nobody
else

02:10:53.629 --> 02:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
and I looked at
 
02:11:00.649 --> 02:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
a sign up sheet
 
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:12.970 --> 02:11:12.980 align:start position:0%
only one person
 
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify and that's you
 
02:11:21.050 --> 02:11:21.060 align:start position:0%

02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the information
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%

02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:37.810 --> 02:11:37.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
we will go right into the public hearing
 
02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:50.890 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:11:50.890 --> 02:11:50.900 align:start position:0%

I'm Casey Conway state representative
 
02:12:58.970 --> 02:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
from Dover representing Stratford County
 
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
District 13 here
 
02:13:03.530 --> 02:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
um on behalf of the Prime sponsor
 
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
um and speaking as a co-sponsor
 
02:13:09.119 --> 02:13:10.069 align:start position:0%
um and speaking as a co-sponsor
um

02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'll start with uh some some
 
02:13:15.770 --> 02:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
details on the origin of this bill so
 
02:13:19.069 --> 02:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
the policy side of this uh contains
 
02:13:21.229 --> 02:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
essentially two Provisions that were
 
02:13:23.209 --> 02:13:23.219 align:start position:0%
introduced last year
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
um that died both past the house on the
 
02:13:28.370 --> 02:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
02:13:32.089 --> 02:13:32.099 align:start position:0%
they died in the covid shortened session
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
um and they re-emerged this year
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth um to his credit
 
02:13:41.089 --> 02:13:41.099 align:start position:0%
uh took two Provisions that uh that had
 
02:13:43.370 --> 02:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
passed I worked with myself worked with
 
02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
the other Democratic co-sponsor on
 
02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
creating This truly bipartisan bill
 
02:13:51.470 --> 02:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh that aims to sort of streamline and
 
02:13:54.770 --> 02:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
reform our sentencing statute for uh
 
02:13:57.169 --> 02:13:57.179 align:start position:0%
drug offenses non-violent drug offenses
 
02:13:59.870 --> 02:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
so specifically what this would do
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
um there's four main Provisions the
 
02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
first is it reduces top end penalties
 
02:14:08.229 --> 02:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
for non-violent drug crimes so sentences
 
02:14:11.450 --> 02:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
and fines and it better aligns them with
 
02:14:13.310 --> 02:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
what's already happening in courthouses
 
02:14:14.689 --> 02:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
it eliminates the possibility of a
 
02:14:19.250 --> 02:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
felony for the first time possession
 
02:14:20.930 --> 02:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
level offense
 
02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
it eliminates the mandatory minimum
 
02:14:25.609 --> 02:14:25.619 align:start position:0%
sentences that we had and we had a
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
number of them just a small handful but
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
those would go away worth noting there's
 
02:14:32.689 --> 02:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
still no mandatory maximum but it does
 
02:14:34.910 --> 02:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
go up to life in prison that is still an
 
02:14:37.310 --> 02:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
option for for any sentence here
 
02:14:40.729 --> 02:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
um and it lowers this is uh so those are
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
sort of a a reduction this would
 
02:14:46.010 --> 02:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
actually strengthen the penalty for
 
02:14:47.810 --> 02:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
fentanyl Possession It lowers the
 
02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
threshold to be charged with a felony
 
02:14:52.490 --> 02:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
and that uh comports with what we know
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
about the dangerousness and the
 
02:14:56.209 --> 02:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
seriousness of fentanyl in very small
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
quantities there is a fiscal note to
 
02:15:00.530 --> 02:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:15:02.810 --> 02:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
um and it indicates an indeterminable
 
02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:04.669 align:start position:0%
um and it indicates an indeterminable
decrease

02:15:04.669 --> 02:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
02:15:06.589 --> 02:15:06.599 align:start position:0%
um in state and County costs and that
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
reflects the lower cost of Prosecuting a
 
02:15:14.209 --> 02:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
case at the uh at the district level
 
02:15:16.370 --> 02:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
versus the Superior Court level for a
 
02:15:20.229 --> 02:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
felony and there is an indeterminable
 
02:15:24.050 --> 02:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
decrease in Revenue
 
02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:24.709 align:start position:0%
decrease in Revenue
um

02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
from Fine Collection but uh it's worth
 
02:15:28.669 --> 02:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
noting and you'll see this in the
 
02:15:31.810 --> 02:15:31.820 align:start position:0%
analysis in the bill that um
 
02:15:34.669 --> 02:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
there's essentially no significant
 
02:15:37.250 --> 02:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
impact in that Revenue collection
 
02:15:40.129 --> 02:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
so uh um with that uh you know I'm a
 
02:15:42.050 --> 02:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
Believer in the bill I support the bill
 
02:15:44.270 --> 02:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's past the house again on a Voice

28 talking about some kind of a quantity
 
02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
um so what is the current has that
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%

and can you tell us what that penalty is
 
02:16:31.729 --> 02:16:31.739 align:start position:0%

02:16:54.770 --> 02:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh if you read this statute and if you
 
02:16:57.290 --> 02:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
what this statue does is it doesn't say
 
02:17:01.250 --> 02:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
if you do X you get y punishment uh it
 
02:17:04.129 --> 02:17:04.139 align:start position:0%
includes discretion for prosecutors
 
02:17:07.250 --> 02:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
based on everything you read to look at
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
the circumstances of a case and charge
 
02:17:11.810 --> 02:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
accordingly so
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
if you look and so I don't have the pay
 
02:17:15.469 --> 02:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this on my computer
 
02:17:15.479 --> 02:17:16.730 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this on my computer
screen

02:17:16.730 --> 02:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
screen
 
02:17:19.849 --> 02:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
um but if you look in
 
02:17:19.859 --> 02:17:20.469 align:start position:0%
um but if you look in
um

02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
version you'll see the numbering yes so
 
02:17:26.690 --> 02:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
I see uh you know fentanyl a fentanyl
 
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
class drug on I believe section
 
02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:31.790 align:start position:0%
class drug on I believe section
three

02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:17:34.190 --> 02:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
or section one
 
02:17:37.129 --> 02:17:37.139 align:start position:0%
parentheses three
 
02:17:39.709 --> 02:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
um fentanyl is crossed out so prior to
 
02:17:40.969 --> 02:17:40.979 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:17:43.849 --> 02:17:43.859 align:start position:0%
one could possess up to five grams of
 
02:17:46.310 --> 02:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
fentanyl under the proposal that's
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
before you now uh fentanyl would trigger
 
02:17:53.450 --> 02:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh this more serious felony type offense
 
02:17:57.650 --> 02:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
uh if one were to possess 0.5 gram or
 
02:18:01.610 --> 02:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
more so 5 grams which was a quite a
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
large quantity for this type of drug to
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
0.5 and then if you look further down in
 
02:18:10.730 --> 02:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
the bill there's a lower threshold of
 
02:18:12.589 --> 02:18:12.599 align:start position:0%
punishment that includes fewer years in
 
02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
prison and so forth the trigger for this
 
02:18:18.650 --> 02:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
one would be 0.25 grams so we're we're
 
02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
really Bringing Down the amount that one
 
02:18:24.349 --> 02:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
could possess without opening oneself up
 
02:18:27.530 --> 02:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
to Serious uh felony level
 
02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
charges and prison time
 
02:18:32.509 --> 02:18:32.519 align:start position:0%
if I hope that answers your question and
 
02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
that help that helps thank you
 
02:18:37.250 --> 02:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
uh representative followed by represent
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
Hackman Phillips
 
02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on excellent
 
02:18:47.450 --> 02:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
Conley I I think I remember that .01
 
02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:51.500 align:start position:0%
gram of fentanyl uh could kill
 
02:18:55.370 --> 02:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
a police officer or other person that
 
02:19:01.070 --> 02:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you so uh
 
02:19:07.969 --> 02:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
I don't know the weight of a lethal dose
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
of fentanyl it is a a minuscule amount
 
02:19:13.129 --> 02:19:13.139 align:start position:0%
but if you read the bill it also
 
02:19:16.009 --> 02:19:16.019 align:start position:0%
includes uh program including any
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
adulterants and uh what we know is that
 
02:19:23.929 --> 02:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
uh heroin itself is is typically not
 
02:19:25.969 --> 02:19:25.979 align:start position:0%
that that's it's less heroin in our
 
02:19:28.730 --> 02:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
state now and it's fentanyl included
 
02:19:32.509 --> 02:19:32.519 align:start position:0%
with other stuff so uh you don't need to
 
02:19:35.690 --> 02:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
have 0.25 grams or 0.5 gram of fentanyl
 
02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
to trigger this it's
 
02:19:40.009 --> 02:19:40.019 align:start position:0%
that small quantities of fentanyl
 
02:19:43.370 --> 02:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
whatever is typically included in a
 
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
street level sale plus the other stuff
 
02:19:49.250 --> 02:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
that is in it is enough to trigger the
 
02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
higher penalty if that makes sense
 
02:19:56.889 --> 02:19:56.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you Mr here
 
02:20:02.210 --> 02:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
representative Conley thank you so much
 
02:20:04.490 --> 02:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
for your commitment to this type of
 
02:20:06.530 --> 02:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice Reform which is
 
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
probably long overdue and for your
 
02:20:10.849 --> 02:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
introduction today
 
02:20:12.889 --> 02:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
um you stated that this bill is
 
02:20:14.929 --> 02:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
codifying the practice of many courts
 
02:20:16.730 --> 02:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
across our state and reducing the
 
02:20:18.490 --> 02:20:18.500 align:start position:0%
penalties and sentences
 
02:20:21.530 --> 02:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
attributable to these types of crimes
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
um would you speak to the Penalty side
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
of that detail and um you know what is
 
02:20:28.610 --> 02:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
the difference between the statutes
 
02:20:30.290 --> 02:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
requirements and the practice of
 
02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
collecting those fines and penalties
 
02:20:34.250 --> 02:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so if you
 
02:20:35.570 --> 02:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
look um
 
02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:37.070 align:start position:0%
look um
that

02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh the question you asked can be best
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
addressed by looking at the the top
 
02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
section of the bill and what you'll see
 
02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:44.030 align:start position:0%
section of the bill and what you'll see
is

02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:20:46.730 --> 02:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
um you know a prison term that may have
 
02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
been 20 years or excuse me 30 years
 
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
before would now have a maximum of 20
 
02:20:53.630 --> 02:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
the fine would go from half a million to
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
300 000 and I'm just cherry picking if
 
02:20:57.530 --> 02:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
as you read the bill there are a handful
 
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
of cases in which uh years are reduced
 
02:21:04.010 --> 02:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh in a moderate way and fines are
 
02:21:07.490 --> 02:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
reduced and this is not just someone
 
02:21:09.469 --> 02:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
taking a black marker and Crossing stuff
 
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
off it's really
 
02:21:13.010 --> 02:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
um looking at what's actually being
 
02:21:14.929 --> 02:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
charged to people and what fines are
 
02:21:17.150 --> 02:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
being assessed so
 
02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:18.290 align:start position:0%
being assessed so
um

02:21:18.290 --> 02:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:21.469 --> 02:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
well I can't uh give you a definitive
 
02:21:23.809 --> 02:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
answer for how much somebody typically
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
gets fined and so forth the reality is
 
02:21:28.429 --> 02:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
nobody is being Char fined a half
 
02:21:30.410 --> 02:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars in New Hampshire nobody
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
is being fined three hundred thousand
 
02:21:34.429 --> 02:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
dollars and if they were it's unlikely
 
02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
that fine would be paid so this is just
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
bumping it down to a level that is
 
02:21:47.090 --> 02:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
I also represent acting Phillips
 
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative personal Nunes
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
02:22:00.050 --> 02:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
representative Conley for coming in I'm
 
02:22:01.849 --> 02:22:01.859 align:start position:0%
delighted to see a bipartisan effort
 
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
seeing you work with my friend uh
 
02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative seeworth on this bill
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
um I am a person that believes very much
 
02:22:11.210 --> 02:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
in recovery assistance for people who
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
have dependence issues or things like
 
02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:14.870 align:start position:0%
have dependence issues or things like
that

02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:17.030 --> 02:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
um I want you to confirm with me I'm
 
02:22:18.770 --> 02:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
reading in the methodology that no
 
02:22:20.330 --> 02:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
additional there will be no additional
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
cost to the Department of Justice or
 
02:22:24.889 --> 02:22:24.899 align:start position:0%
criminal justice Bureau in this bill I
 
02:22:25.969 --> 02:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
believe that's what I read in the
 
02:22:27.650 --> 02:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
methodology can you just confirm that
 
02:22:29.710 --> 02:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
with me foreign
 
02:22:32.690 --> 02:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
I I will never say never I don't know
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
what scenarios one might encounter but
 
02:22:40.010 --> 02:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh in the the premise that here is that
 
02:22:44.330 --> 02:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh prosecution costs would go down for
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
fewer felony charges particularly the
 
02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
first time right so the first time
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
possession level would be bumped down to
 
02:22:53.090 --> 02:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor well now one does not have
 
02:22:56.270 --> 02:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
to uh adjudicate that process at the
 
02:22:57.770 --> 02:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
superior court level
 
02:23:00.590 --> 02:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
so that's the intent that's what I
 
02:23:02.270 --> 02:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
foresee happening that is what the
 
02:23:04.190 --> 02:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
testimony leading up to today has
 
02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:05.270 align:start position:0%
testimony leading up to today has
suggested

02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
02:23:06.830 --> 02:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
02:23:09.050 --> 02:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you that nothing would ever
 
02:23:10.969 --> 02:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
lead to a higher cost uh for the
 
02:23:12.170 --> 02:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
apartment but that's the intent and
 
02:23:13.969 --> 02:23:13.979 align:start position:0%
that's what we've been heard that's what
 
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Conley and
 
02:23:18.170 --> 02:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Murphy
 
02:23:22.429 --> 02:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:23:25.130 --> 02:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative Conley uh just two
 
02:23:26.929 --> 02:23:26.939 align:start position:0%
questions just to clarify
 
02:23:28.910 --> 02:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
these are for drug possession only
 
02:23:30.889 --> 02:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
correct not the distribution
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
and number true God
 
02:23:35.690 --> 02:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
and number two I would agree with
 
02:23:38.030 --> 02:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Almy that even a
 
02:23:39.710 --> 02:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
minuscule amount of fentanyl can be a
 
02:23:40.969 --> 02:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
very dangerous drug and would you ever
 
02:23:44.270 --> 02:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
consider it uh being uh more more
 
02:23:46.309 --> 02:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
specific to any possession of fentanyl
 
02:23:49.730 --> 02:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
versus any specific amount thank you
 
02:23:52.130 --> 02:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
thank you so um
 
02:23:53.690 --> 02:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
can I answer the second one first
 
02:23:55.490 --> 02:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
because I honestly forgot your first one
 
02:23:56.929 --> 02:23:56.939 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry and I'll ask you to restate it
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
but um to that question around fentanyl
 
02:24:04.210 --> 02:24:04.220 align:start position:0%
this has been this is a number that um
 
02:24:07.969 --> 02:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
uh threads the needle of being too harsh
 
02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
for some people and not harsh enough for
 
02:24:12.050 --> 02:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
others it really comes down in the
 
02:24:14.270 --> 02:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
middle and reflects
 
02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:16.130 align:start position:0%
middle and reflects
um

02:24:16.130 --> 02:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:18.170 --> 02:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
I think I'm not going to say happy
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
medium when we're talking about a killer
 
02:24:23.809 --> 02:24:23.819 align:start position:0%
drug but it it's really a threshold that
 
02:24:26.690 --> 02:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement is comfortable with
 
02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:28.190 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement is comfortable with
um

02:24:28.190 --> 02:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:31.969 --> 02:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing head shaking uh let me stop
 
02:24:34.730 --> 02:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
if the committee wishes to make an
 
02:24:36.590 --> 02:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill
 
02:24:38.510 --> 02:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
um that is the committee's prerogative
 
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
and I'll leave it there
 
02:24:44.270 --> 02:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
and his other question was uh
 
02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:46.490 align:start position:0%
and his other question was uh
distribution

02:24:46.490 --> 02:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
02:24:49.550 --> 02:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so this bill nothing about this is
 
02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:50.510 align:start position:0%
yeah so this bill nothing about this is
giving

02:24:50.510 --> 02:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
giving
 
02:24:53.090 --> 02:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
a free pass to anyone involved in
 
02:24:54.170 --> 02:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
trafficking there's a separate
 
02:24:56.929 --> 02:24:56.939 align:start position:0%
trafficking statute major traffickers
 
02:24:59.870 --> 02:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
are charged with federal crimes uh
 
02:25:01.969 --> 02:25:01.979 align:start position:0%
trafficking often yields ancillary
 
02:25:04.610 --> 02:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
charges uh that none of that is touched
 
02:25:06.170 --> 02:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
under this and I that's a good question
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I want to be very clear this is not
 
02:25:10.849 --> 02:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
about selling this is possession type
 
02:25:10.859 --> 02:25:12.710 align:start position:0%
about selling this is possession type
offenses

02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
02:25:15.410 --> 02:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you as just my experience is that
 
02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
any fentanyl is probably very dangerous
 
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
outside of control setting like an
 
02:25:21.530 --> 02:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
operating room
 
02:25:23.809 --> 02:25:23.819 align:start position:0%
but thank you for your response
 
02:25:23.819 --> 02:25:32.090 align:start position:0%
but thank you for your response
representative

02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:38.090 --> 02:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:42.050 --> 02:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
okay uh sorry about that my cursor froze
 
02:25:44.270 --> 02:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
for a second uh thank you Mr chairman
 
02:25:46.490 --> 02:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Conley for
 
02:25:48.650 --> 02:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:25:51.889 --> 02:25:51.899 align:start position:0%
um as someone who's not not familiar
 
02:25:53.389 --> 02:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
02:25:55.929 --> 02:25:55.939 align:start position:0%
um this topic I guess I'll just ask you
 
02:25:59.330 --> 02:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
in an era where crime seems to be
 
02:26:01.610 --> 02:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
spiking around the country
 
02:26:04.490 --> 02:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
um are you concerned at all that that
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
lessening penalties could encourage
 
02:26:11.450 --> 02:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
um additional use and further crime
 
02:26:13.130 --> 02:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and this
 
02:26:14.990 --> 02:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
question has been addressed multiple
 
02:26:17.150 --> 02:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
times fortunately I can I'm comfortable
 
02:26:18.530 --> 02:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
answering it but through through the
 
02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
policy committee so this has come up
 
02:26:21.889 --> 02:26:21.899 align:start position:0%
last term in criminal justice this term
 
02:26:24.050 --> 02:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
in criminal justice and
 
02:26:24.060 --> 02:26:25.010 align:start position:0%
in criminal justice and
um

02:26:25.010 --> 02:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:27.530 --> 02:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
this doesn't mean that somebody who
 
02:26:29.450 --> 02:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
commits a serious drug crime doesn't go
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
to prison there's if you read through
 
02:26:32.929 --> 02:26:32.939 align:start position:0%
the bill you
 
02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
you could still be sentenced to life in
 
02:26:36.530 --> 02:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
prison and there are people in our state
 
02:26:38.210 --> 02:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
serving up serving sentences that
 
02:26:40.490 --> 02:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
include up to life in prison that
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change under this bill uh this
 
02:26:44.750 --> 02:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
is a this is a if you you know this is
 
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
really about possession level offenses
 
02:26:53.450 --> 02:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
not trafficking uh not uh violence uh
 
02:26:56.929 --> 02:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
that may occur in the uh through drug
 
02:26:58.670 --> 02:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
sales that's all covered in separate
 
02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes and they're all uh I
 
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
mean we've heard testimony in criminal
 
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
justice that our statutes need to come
 
02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
down none of that would occur this is
 
02:27:09.770 --> 02:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
really about possession type offenses
 
02:27:09.780 --> 02:27:10.429 align:start position:0%
really about possession type offenses
um

02:27:10.429 --> 02:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:11.870 --> 02:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
so and
 
02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
and again when you read through the
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
statute there's still teeth here it just
 
02:27:16.849 --> 02:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
means that somebody wouldn't be
 
02:27:19.550 --> 02:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
sentenced to to a maximum of 30 years it
 
02:27:22.429 --> 02:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
might be 20. uh it might be
 
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
um five years instead of seven
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
that to me is still a pretty significant
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
prison time
 
02:27:31.370 --> 02:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:31.380 --> 02:27:33.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:27:33.950 --> 02:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:27:37.309 --> 02:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on
 
02:27:39.290 --> 02:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
if we
 
02:27:43.150 --> 02:27:43.160 align:start position:0%
um put fentanyl at any
 
02:27:47.330 --> 02:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
fentanyl uh and since this is possession
 
02:27:51.170 --> 02:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
most of the people that on
 
02:27:56.210 --> 02:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
are on drugs and get some LSD I didn't
 
02:28:00.610 --> 02:28:00.620 align:start position:0%
know it was still around or mass or or
 
02:28:05.210 --> 02:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
anything like that that has a small
 
02:28:08.990 --> 02:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
amount of fentanyl in it will not know
 
02:28:11.270 --> 02:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
until their
 
02:28:14.809 --> 02:28:14.819 align:start position:0%
their dying of it probably
 
02:28:17.090 --> 02:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
um that they've gotten something with
 
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
fentanyl and I'm I'm concerned when if
 
02:28:24.770 --> 02:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
we put it down to zero whether we would
 
02:28:27.170 --> 02:28:27.180 align:start position:0%
be capturing a fair number of people
 
02:28:27.180 --> 02:28:28.250 align:start position:0%
be capturing a fair number of people
that

02:28:28.250 --> 02:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
that would
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
on would not really realize that that's
 
02:28:36.349 --> 02:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
what what they had and whether there's a
 
02:28:39.410 --> 02:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
defense against that ignorance we talk
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:46.969 --> 02:28:46.979 align:start position:0%
there is no Revenue in this bill
 
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have had this Bill thank
 
02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:51.290 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have had this Bill thank
you

02:28:51.290 --> 02:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
all right let's Hold It Down
 
02:28:58.010 --> 02:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
anybody else on the panelists with
 
02:28:58.020 --> 02:29:01.610 align:start position:0%
anybody else on the panelists with
questions

02:29:01.610 --> 02:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair I've got another
 
02:29:05.570 --> 02:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
question for you uh representative
 
02:29:05.580 --> 02:29:06.710 align:start position:0%
question for you uh representative
Connolly

02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
Connolly
 
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
is it is my memory says just a week or
 
02:29:10.849 --> 02:29:10.859 align:start position:0%
two ago didn't we have a baby that died
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:19.130 --> 02:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
and if if that is the case how I think
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
it was New Hampshire right
 
02:29:23.330 --> 02:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh I remember reading in the paper but
 
02:29:25.610 --> 02:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
let's use that example even if it wasn't
 
02:29:26.809 --> 02:29:26.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:29:29.809 --> 02:29:29.819 align:start position:0%
that those folks the parents which still
 
02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
could still be charged criminally
 
02:29:32.570 --> 02:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
couldn't they
 
02:29:34.210 --> 02:29:34.220 align:start position:0%
for negligence
 
02:29:36.530 --> 02:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
that that substance to be near the
 
02:29:38.570 --> 02:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
infant I was fentanyl I know it was
 
02:29:40.730 --> 02:29:40.740 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl thank you representative I'm
 
02:29:42.349 --> 02:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
not familiar with the case although it
 
02:29:45.170 --> 02:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
sounds like a tragedy that
 
02:29:49.070 --> 02:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
does occur from time to time so our
 
02:29:51.469 --> 02:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes are voluminous they
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
cover nearly all scenarios that one
 
02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
might encounter
 
02:29:58.849 --> 02:29:58.859 align:start position:0%
um from Reckless uh you know Reckless
 
02:30:00.140 --> 02:30:00.150 align:start position:0%
Behavior to
 
02:30:00.150 --> 02:30:00.650 align:start position:0%
Behavior to
[Music]

02:30:00.650 --> 02:30:00.660 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:30:00.660 --> 02:30:01.790 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:30:01.790 --> 02:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:05.210 --> 02:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
it just runs the gamut so it's it's safe
 
02:30:07.070 --> 02:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
to say that if somebody commits the act
 
02:30:10.130 --> 02:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
that you just described they would be uh
 
02:30:12.650 --> 02:30:12.660 align:start position:0%
subject to numerous penalties well
 
02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
beyond what is covered in this
 
02:30:18.050 --> 02:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
possession type uh statute so
 
02:30:19.550 --> 02:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
um the fentanyl piece has been well
 
02:30:22.190 --> 02:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
vetted at the policy committee level uh
 
02:30:24.190 --> 02:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
the committee has noted some concerns
 
02:30:26.210 --> 02:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
these are things we've heard all before
 
02:30:28.730 --> 02:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
but I I
 
02:30:30.770 --> 02:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
as I noted I it's the committee's
 
02:30:32.389 --> 02:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
prerogative to the representatives
 
02:30:32.399 --> 02:30:33.410 align:start position:0%
prerogative to the representatives
question

02:30:33.410 --> 02:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:30:33.420 --> 02:30:34.309 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:36.590 --> 02:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean there are numerous penalties
 
02:30:38.450 --> 02:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
that a person would face under the
 
02:30:41.450 --> 02:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
scenario you described okay thank you
 
02:30:44.030 --> 02:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the panelists
 
02:30:47.570 --> 02:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
as we have three attendees that want to
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:53.870 --> 02:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
02:30:56.450 --> 02:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
the first Mr chairman I'm I'm going to
 
02:30:58.429 --> 02:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
depart the meeting because I'm in
 
02:31:00.110 --> 02:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm being summoned by my
 
02:31:02.570 --> 02:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
chair to do an exact session but if
 
02:31:04.190 --> 02:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
anyone has questions I'm happy to talk
 
02:31:05.929 --> 02:31:05.939 align:start position:0%
about this representative seeworth the
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
other co-sponsors I'm sure would happy
 
02:31:09.710 --> 02:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
to be happy to answer questions but I
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say I'll be gone and I
 
02:31:12.770 --> 02:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
won't be able to answer anything that
 
02:31:14.570 --> 02:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
might arise well thank you
 
02:31:17.630 --> 02:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative thank you all take care
 
02:31:21.610 --> 02:31:21.620 align:start position:0%
do you mean you want to send Let's uh
 
02:31:23.710 --> 02:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Fowler
 
02:31:26.330 --> 02:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
I just did
 
02:31:29.330 --> 02:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
I oh peace
 
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
um Mr Fowler is a member of the public
 
02:31:35.809 --> 02:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill and said he has
 
02:31:39.170 --> 02:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
three minutes of like the testing
 
02:31:41.450 --> 02:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
oh there he is
 
02:31:41.460 --> 02:31:42.830 align:start position:0%
oh there he is
right

02:31:42.830 --> 02:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:31:46.010 --> 02:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon chairman and committee
 
02:31:48.170 --> 02:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
can y'all hear me yes
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
awesome well thank you all for hearing
 
02:31:52.730 --> 02:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
me out today and I also sent a letter
 
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
this morning that will kind of get into
 
02:31:58.730 --> 02:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
the details of you know why I stand in
 
02:32:01.190 --> 02:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I'm first and
 
02:32:03.050 --> 02:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
foremost a person in long-term recovery
 
02:32:05.210 --> 02:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
I both use and sold drugs in New
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for over 10 years and have
 
02:32:09.530 --> 02:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
been in recovery for the past six years
 
02:32:11.570 --> 02:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
I'm a Certified Recovery support worker
 
02:32:13.550 --> 02:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
and run a harm reduction program in the
 
02:32:15.309 --> 02:32:15.319 align:start position:0%
Upper Valley New Hampshire and Vermont
 
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh I'm currently involved in some
 
02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
research at the Dartmouth Institute
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
focusing on drug use and health care and
 
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
I've also done some other research and I
 
02:32:27.889 --> 02:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
really support this bill with the idea
 
02:32:29.330 --> 02:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
that we're going to not criminalize
 
02:32:31.490 --> 02:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
people with substance use disorders and
 
02:32:33.950 --> 02:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
give them a felony when they're first
 
02:32:36.110 --> 02:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know for their first mistake their
 
02:32:38.450 --> 02:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
first charge and
 
02:32:40.849 --> 02:32:40.859 align:start position:0%
um but really when it comes down to the
 
02:32:42.469 --> 02:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
latter parts of the bill that get into
 
02:32:44.270 --> 02:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and being specific in
 
02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
scheduling it really makes no sense it
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
is really
 
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
um inaccurate and complicated and if you
 
02:32:53.929 --> 02:32:53.939 align:start position:0%
really wanted to save money given this
 
02:32:55.370 --> 02:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
is you know kind of the Ways and Means
 
02:32:58.130 --> 02:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
Committee we would simplify this and not
 
02:33:00.290 --> 02:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
try to criminalize people and argue over
 
02:33:03.050 --> 02:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
fractions of a gram a lot of my clients
 
02:33:04.969 --> 02:33:04.979 align:start position:0%
in recent years have reported they use
 
02:33:07.849 --> 02:33:07.859 align:start position:0%
five to ten grams of fentanyl a day the
 
02:33:09.230 --> 02:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
difference being The Binding agent
 
02:33:11.630 --> 02:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
because because most of this killer
 
02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
fentanyl we're talking about the super
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
potent pure uncut stuff doesn't come
 
02:33:16.969 --> 02:33:16.979 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire in that way it's
 
02:33:18.770 --> 02:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
usually coming in with a binding agent
 
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
it's most of that binding agent so
 
02:33:23.570 --> 02:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
people who are low level you know
 
02:33:26.210 --> 02:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder people with a
 
02:33:28.849 --> 02:33:28.859 align:start position:0%
daily habit of five to ten grams are
 
02:33:31.490 --> 02:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
oftentimes mislabeled a dealer and
 
02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
there's really not much of a difference
 
02:33:34.849 --> 02:33:34.859 align:start position:0%
between a drug user and a drug dealer
 
02:33:36.290 --> 02:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
they're oftentimes the same person
 
02:33:38.389 --> 02:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
because there's no grocery store to go
 
02:33:42.170 --> 02:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
to and so I would really advocate for
 
02:33:44.690 --> 02:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
passing this bill because we know that
 
02:33:47.389 --> 02:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
prohibition doesn't work the idea seems
 
02:33:49.250 --> 02:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
to make sense at first if we prohibit
 
02:33:50.929 --> 02:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
something it will prevent it from
 
02:33:53.210 --> 02:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
happening but we know that prohibition
 
02:33:56.030 --> 02:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
gave us fentanyl in the overdose crisis
 
02:33:57.950 --> 02:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
and everything before us we know that
 
02:33:59.570 --> 02:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
this is a system that makes addictive
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
disorders worse and criminalizing people
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
taking people into captivity and taking
 
02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
away their rights does nothing to
 
02:34:08.450 --> 02:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
support recovery and so I love that this
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
bill is moving away from criminal model
 
02:34:12.590 --> 02:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
and towards a public health model but I
 
02:34:14.210 --> 02:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
would really advocate for simplifying
 
02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
the scheduling apparatus rather than
 
02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
complicating it and there's a whole long
 
02:34:21.830 --> 02:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
discussion for each line item for each
 
02:34:24.530 --> 02:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
drug it's subjective it's not based in
 
02:34:28.190 --> 02:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
science and um yeah that's happy to
 
02:34:30.770 --> 02:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
answer questions but I I do think this
 
02:34:31.910 --> 02:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
bill is a step in the right direction
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
it's uh so thank you thank you for your
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr Fowler questions from the
 
02:34:37.439 --> 02:34:38.809 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr Fowler questions from the
committee

02:34:38.809 --> 02:34:38.819 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:34:41.270 --> 02:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
what you think
 
02:34:45.650 --> 02:34:45.660 align:start position:0%
no questions thank you the next can uh
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
attendee is Tony narrow
 
02:34:55.130 --> 02:34:55.140 align:start position:0%
if you could let him in yep just did yep
 
02:34:57.349 --> 02:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
and a member of the public from the New
 
02:34:58.790 --> 02:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of criminal
 
02:35:00.349 --> 02:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill
 
02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
and it would like three minutes to
 
02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:11.150 align:start position:0%
and it would like three minutes to
testify

02:35:11.150 --> 02:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:12.650 --> 02:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
good morning can everyone hear me okay
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um yes my name is Anthony
 
02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
narrow I am speaking as a representative
 
02:35:20.809 --> 02:35:20.819 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Association of
 
02:35:22.610 --> 02:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
criminal defense lawyers I have been a
 
02:35:25.130 --> 02:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
criminal defense attorney uh for over 12
 
02:35:25.140 --> 02:35:26.330 align:start position:0%
criminal defense attorney uh for over 12
years

02:35:26.330 --> 02:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
um I went to Private Practice in
 
02:35:29.630 --> 02:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
November so the majority of my career
 
02:35:31.250 --> 02:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
has been with the New Hampshire public
 
02:35:33.950 --> 02:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
defender in Rockingham and Hillsborough
 
02:35:36.349 --> 02:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
counties both North and South
 
02:35:38.510 --> 02:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
um I want to talk today about the
 
02:35:40.849 --> 02:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
financial impact of this bill as it
 
02:35:43.309 --> 02:35:43.319 align:start position:0%
relates to how fentanyl is addressed on
 
02:35:45.349 --> 02:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
the other aspects which the prior
 
02:35:47.570 --> 02:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
speaker just addressed are some social
 
02:35:50.450 --> 02:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
justice issues which I agree with but I
 
02:35:52.250 --> 02:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
I want to focus on the financial impact
 
02:35:54.590 --> 02:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
here today though I'll answer questions
 
02:35:56.830 --> 02:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
about any Topic at any time
 
02:35:59.690 --> 02:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
in the 1980s Congress made a critical
 
02:36:02.510 --> 02:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
error by creating a disparity a
 
02:36:04.490 --> 02:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
disparity disparity and sentencing
 
02:36:06.889 --> 02:36:06.899 align:start position:0%
between crack cocaine and powder cocaine
 
02:36:09.650 --> 02:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
and for decades poor people and
 
02:36:12.050 --> 02:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
disproportionately uh black people found
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
themselves spending a significant period
 
02:36:16.130 --> 02:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
of time in prison and this led to a
 
02:36:18.370 --> 02:36:18.380 align:start position:0%
costly spike in the prison population
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and it didn't end the crack
 
02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
epidemic what it did from the
 
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
perspective of taxpayers was squander
 
02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of taxpayer
 
02:36:29.570 --> 02:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
dollars and I'm hoping that we don't
 
02:36:31.010 --> 02:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
make that mistake here in New Hampshire
 
02:36:33.230 --> 02:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
when it comes to Fentanyl
 
02:36:35.690 --> 02:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
fentanyl is being sold in the same
 
02:36:37.969 --> 02:36:37.979 align:start position:0%
quantities as heroin because that is
 
02:36:40.370 --> 02:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
what people are used to buying as a
 
02:36:42.650 --> 02:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
prior speaker just noted if you are a
 
02:36:45.530 --> 02:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
two gram a day heroin user you're going
 
02:36:48.349 --> 02:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
to continue buying two grams a day of
 
02:36:50.389 --> 02:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
fentanyl now it's not actually two
 
02:36:53.330 --> 02:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
actual grams of fentanyl it's mostly the
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
The Binding agent the adulterants and
 
02:36:58.309 --> 02:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
um you know what we call on the street
 
02:37:02.570 --> 02:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
cut so if you're buying a gram of
 
02:37:04.969 --> 02:37:04.979 align:start position:0%
fentanyl or heroin and everyone it's
 
02:37:06.830 --> 02:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
interchangeable they'll say I need a
 
02:37:07.969 --> 02:37:07.979 align:start position:0%
gram of brown
 
02:37:09.950 --> 02:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
and they might get heroin they might get
 
02:37:12.050 --> 02:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
fentanyl they don't know
 
02:37:13.849 --> 02:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
um but they're not getting an actual
 
02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
gram of fentanyl it's all cut
 
02:37:19.370 --> 02:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
um and so what is sold is really the
 
02:37:22.010 --> 02:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
adulterants and dilutants so to say that
 
02:37:22.020 --> 02:37:23.510 align:start position:0%
adulterants and dilutants so to say that
well

02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:37:25.969 --> 02:37:25.979 align:start position:0%
um five grams or more or 0.5 grams or
 
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
more including the the luteins or
 
02:37:29.389 --> 02:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
adulterants is going to significantly
 
02:37:31.790 --> 02:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
punish those who possess a a substance
 
02:37:34.270 --> 02:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
containing fentanyl more than one person
 
02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
possessing the same amount of heroin
 
02:37:38.809 --> 02:37:38.819 align:start position:0%
um even though the two drugs are being
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
used interchangeably on the street
 
02:37:42.469 --> 02:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
there's no difference in the mental
 
02:37:44.210 --> 02:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
state for the crime
 
02:37:46.610 --> 02:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
um and and this is this was the problem
 
02:37:49.010 --> 02:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
with the crack cocaine and powder
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
cocaine problem and it's happening all
 
02:37:53.570 --> 02:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
over again in this bill we know more
 
02:37:55.790 --> 02:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
about addiction than we did in the 1980s
 
02:37:57.889 --> 02:37:57.899 align:start position:0%
and we know that we can't incarcerate
 
02:37:59.690 --> 02:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
our way out of the problem
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
um that's not how our taxpayers money
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
should be invested we do know that
 
02:38:05.570 --> 02:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
investing in substance abuse treatment
 
02:38:07.550 --> 02:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
we just heard somebody in recovery for
 
02:38:08.929 --> 02:38:08.939 align:start position:0%
six years
 
02:38:10.250 --> 02:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
um investing in substance abuse
 
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
treatment which includes our drug courts
 
02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
which are very successful in the state
 
02:38:16.190 --> 02:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
we should be proud of mental health
 
02:38:18.650 --> 02:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
treatment and Social Services that's
 
02:38:20.929 --> 02:38:20.939 align:start position:0%
what's effective and the benefit of
 
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
combating addiction in an effective way
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
is beyond social it's also good for the
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
bottom line it's good for taxpayers it
 
02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
reduces the amount of money we need to
 
02:38:32.990 --> 02:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
spend on incarcerated people in the
 
02:38:34.910 --> 02:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
short term and long term because when
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
you think about the short term okay
 
02:38:39.349 --> 02:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
that's forty thousand dollars a year for
 
02:38:41.809 --> 02:38:41.819 align:start position:0%
a prison sentence but we know about
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
recidivism in this state and how high
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
the recidivism rates are and parole
 
02:38:47.690 --> 02:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
violation so they're going back to
 
02:38:49.490 --> 02:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
prison we also know that once their
 
02:38:51.710 --> 02:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
prison sentence is up they are going to
 
02:38:53.570 --> 02:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
be more likely to recidivate and commit
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
another crime so we have long-term costs
 
02:38:58.270 --> 02:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
as well if they don't receive treatment
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
so investing in treatment rather than
 
02:39:03.889 --> 02:39:03.899 align:start position:0%
increasing penalties
 
02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
um for fentanyl possession which again
 
02:39:11.450 --> 02:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
is is treating addicts unequally
 
02:39:14.330 --> 02:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
um and is not based in science and is
 
02:39:17.210 --> 02:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
not considering the small amounts of
 
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
fentanyl in an actual bag compared to
 
02:39:20.530 --> 02:39:20.540 align:start position:0%
the cut
 
02:39:24.309 --> 02:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
is a problem financially
 
02:39:27.050 --> 02:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes
 
02:39:29.929 --> 02:39:29.939 align:start position:0%
the policy has been passed by the
 
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and Public Safety
 
02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:32.710 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and Public Safety
Committee

02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
02:39:35.630 --> 02:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
we're only interested in the revenue
 
02:39:38.330 --> 02:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
aspects of this and the amount of the
 
02:39:41.389 --> 02:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
fines and things so if you could
 
02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
address that and yet I think signed up
 
02:39:46.429 --> 02:39:46.439 align:start position:0%
for three minutes and you've gone over
 
02:39:49.190 --> 02:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
that so if you could just arrested just
 
02:39:51.170 --> 02:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
to address the revenue part of it I
 
02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
appreciate it yes thank you and I
 
02:39:55.849 --> 02:39:55.859 align:start position:0%
apologize if I went off off
 
02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
um your agenda you know as far as
 
02:40:00.050 --> 02:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
Revenue goes
 
02:40:03.530 --> 02:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
um I don't see a revenue benefit to this
 
02:40:03.540 --> 02:40:04.190 align:start position:0%
um I don't see a revenue benefit to this
um

02:40:04.190 --> 02:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:05.630 --> 02:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
to this statue I mean there are
 
02:40:07.309 --> 02:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
mandatory fines I think the mandatory
 
02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
fines should go away if you are finding
 
02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who is a poor addict whether
 
02:40:17.450 --> 02:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
it's 500 as a mandatory fine or thirty
 
02:40:18.590 --> 02:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars which you know they'll
 
02:40:20.330 --> 02:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
never be able to pay
 
02:40:21.950 --> 02:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
um why do we have that provision in the
 
02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:23.210 align:start position:0%
um why do we have that provision in the
statute

02:40:23.210 --> 02:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:40:26.210 --> 02:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
um it it it's it's not very logical to
 
02:40:28.190 --> 02:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
me and so that's my position as far as
 
02:40:29.809 --> 02:40:29.819 align:start position:0%
the fines go
 
02:40:32.270 --> 02:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
um and I do think
 
02:40:35.210 --> 02:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's that's my answer to
 
02:40:36.469 --> 02:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
that question
 
02:40:39.070 --> 02:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
um with respect to uh representative
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
abrami who asked about the the toddler
 
02:40:44.150 --> 02:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
who passed away
 
02:40:46.130 --> 02:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
um cert that uh couple was charged with
 
02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
negligent homicide
 
02:40:50.750 --> 02:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
um if just to answer your question about
 
02:40:52.429 --> 02:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
that it was it was two parents they were
 
02:40:54.530 --> 02:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
charged with negligent homicide and um
 
02:40:56.030 --> 02:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
under some circumstances you could be
 
02:40:58.490 --> 02:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
charged in theory with manslaughter
 
02:41:00.410 --> 02:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
um for recklessly causing the death of
 
02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
another person it all depends on the
 
02:41:03.530 --> 02:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
circumstances but I just want to answer
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
that question for you thank you uh Tony
 
02:41:07.610 --> 02:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh that was New Hampshire though right
 
02:41:09.950 --> 02:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
yes that was New Hampshire I believe it
 
02:41:11.330 --> 02:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
was a
 
02:41:14.090 --> 02:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
Manchester case
 
02:41:18.230 --> 02:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and um and they were just arrested in
 
02:41:20.929 --> 02:41:20.939 align:start position:0%
in Londonderry I believe at the truck
 
02:41:23.929 --> 02:41:23.939 align:start position:0%
stop the passing of the child didn't
 
02:41:26.090 --> 02:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
just happen I think that
 
02:41:27.770 --> 02:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
um it happened a while ago and they just
 
02:41:29.570 --> 02:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
arrested the parents and that's why it
 
02:41:32.170 --> 02:41:32.180 align:start position:0%
was in the news but it was undoubtedly
 
02:41:34.250 --> 02:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly tragic and I think again
 
02:41:37.250 --> 02:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
speaks to the need for addressing the
 
02:41:39.889 --> 02:41:39.899 align:start position:0%
social ills that lead to addiction
 
02:41:41.750 --> 02:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so we can have preventative measures
 
02:41:43.429 --> 02:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
to stop tragedies like this from
 
02:41:43.439 --> 02:41:44.389 align:start position:0%
to stop tragedies like this from
happening

02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you right and they they've also I
 
02:41:49.849 --> 02:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
believe they found the third person that
 
02:41:51.590 --> 02:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
they're planning on charging for the
 
02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:53.389 align:start position:0%
they're planning on charging for the
same

02:41:53.389 --> 02:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:41:55.670 --> 02:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
um that's your testimony Mr Nero all
 
02:41:58.849 --> 02:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
right yes sir thank you for your
 
02:42:01.090 --> 02:42:01.100 align:start position:0%

02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:06.110 align:start position:0%
to me you have any questions to ask Mr
Nero

he okay I'm yeah opposes it and he wants
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%

um my name is John brofanski and I
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Association
 
02:42:55.730 --> 02:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
of Chief employees I'm chairperson of

the chief drug committee and uh just by
 
02:43:00.349 --> 02:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
way of background um I've been in
 
02:43:03.170 --> 02:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
continuous service to the public in law
 
02:43:04.910 --> 02:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement capacity for more than 42
 
02:43:08.270 --> 02:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
years having served 27 years of my
 
02:43:10.429 --> 02:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
career directly dealing with substance
 
02:43:12.530 --> 02:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
abuse issues and I've been the chief

of police here in the granite state are
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
vehemently opposed to this bill
 
02:43:22.910 --> 02:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
the bill if passed will reduce the
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
penalties universally used against drug
 
02:43:27.889 --> 02:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
traffickers and not drug users and have
 
02:43:31.490 --> 02:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
negligible Financial impact these are
 
02:43:33.889 --> 02:43:33.899 align:start position:0%
definitely not non-violent crimes in
 
02:43:36.050 --> 02:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
fact my detectives are working on a
 
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
death resulting drug case as we speak as
 
02:43:41.690 --> 02:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
are many other detectives you most
 
02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
recently have seen cases in Hudson and
 
02:43:48.530 --> 02:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
in Merrimack that produce charges with
 
02:43:51.170 --> 02:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
respect to death resulting cases and
 
02:43:53.450 --> 02:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
these are definitely not user quantities
 
02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
as have been discussed in previous
 
02:43:56.160 --> 02:43:57.830 align:start position:0%
as have been discussed in previous
testimony

02:43:57.830 --> 02:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:44:00.889 --> 02:44:00.899 align:start position:0%
the reduction in maximum prison time
 
02:44:03.770 --> 02:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
from 30 to 20 years and from 20 to 15
 
02:44:06.170 --> 02:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
and from seven to five in various
 
02:44:08.570 --> 02:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
sections of this bill dilutes the strong
 
02:44:11.929 --> 02:44:11.939 align:start position:0%
message against drug dealing and dilutes
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
the ability to obtain just and
 
02:44:16.730 --> 02:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
reasonable sentences in the most
 
02:44:19.490 --> 02:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
egregious cases that we see in all
 
02:44:20.990 --> 02:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
practicality very few people are
 
02:44:22.910 --> 02:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
currently sentenced to the maximum term
 
02:44:25.849 --> 02:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
of incarceration so these charges only
 
02:44:28.490 --> 02:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
serve to hamstring the courts and
 
02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
prosecutors when addressing The Most
 
02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
Dangerous Drug traffickers not users by
 
02:44:36.410 --> 02:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
reducing the penalties used to change to
 
02:44:38.210 --> 02:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
charge rather drug traffickers who
 
02:44:41.330 --> 02:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
typically are not drug users we send the
 
02:44:44.210 --> 02:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
wrong message to drug traffickers whose
 
02:44:46.490 --> 02:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
only aim is to make money while
 
02:44:48.830 --> 02:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
destroying the lives of others in
 
02:44:53.570 --> 02:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
section 1C page two on line 34 the bill
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
proposes to reduce the maximum sentence
 
02:44:58.550 --> 02:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
for less than one gram of heroin from
 
02:45:01.370 --> 02:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
seven to Five Years yet one half gram
 
02:45:04.610 --> 02:45:04.620 align:start position:0%
equates to 12 bags of heroin or fentanyl
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
enough to kill 12 people or more in one
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
quarter gram equates to about six bags
 
02:45:12.410 --> 02:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
of heroin that can kill at least six or
 
02:45:14.570 --> 02:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
more people so the bill proposes the
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
elimination of a one-year minimum
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentence for selling drugs in
 
02:45:23.330 --> 02:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
or within one thousand feet of a school
 
02:45:24.830 --> 02:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
um ladies and gentlemen we should never
 
02:45:27.290 --> 02:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
listen to penalties for endangering our
 
02:45:29.330 --> 02:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
children and our youth and the next
 
02:45:31.550 --> 02:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
generation of Americans in my experience
 
02:45:33.730 --> 02:45:33.740 align:start position:0%
very few cases of this penalty
 
02:45:35.990 --> 02:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
enhancement are charged and the reason
 
02:45:38.270 --> 02:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
why is because the penalty enhancement
 
02:45:40.670 --> 02:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
and disincentive is in fact is is
 
02:45:43.790 --> 02:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
effective the bill removes the mandatory
 
02:45:45.889 --> 02:45:45.899 align:start position:0%
minimum sentence for not less than 25
 
02:45:49.210 --> 02:45:49.220 align:start position:0%
years for operating a drug Enterprise
 
02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
these are the worst of the worst of drug
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
traffickers they are responsible for the
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
death and destruction of hundreds of
 
02:45:59.330 --> 02:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:01.910 --> 02:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
can you concentrate on the revenue
 
02:46:04.750 --> 02:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
aspects of it primarily
 
02:46:08.690 --> 02:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
the the effect here is is that the
 
02:46:11.690 --> 02:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
maximum penalties are rarely charged and
 
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
as a result what happens here is the
 
02:46:16.370 --> 02:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
financial impact here
 
02:46:18.590 --> 02:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
um is rather negligible and there's been
 
02:46:20.090 --> 02:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
02:46:22.210 --> 02:46:22.220 align:start position:0%
um whether or not this bill addresses
 
02:46:24.650 --> 02:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
manufacturing or selling it does if you
 
02:46:25.969 --> 02:46:25.979 align:start position:0%
look at the first page in the first
 
02:46:28.550 --> 02:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
sentence it refers to manufacturer so
 
02:46:31.730 --> 02:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
the financial impact here is negligible
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
but the um unintended consequences of
 
02:46:37.010 --> 02:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
the message that it sends to drug
 
02:46:40.309 --> 02:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
traffickers who are very well aware very
 
02:46:42.830 --> 02:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
well aware of what the quantities are as
 
02:46:44.690 --> 02:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
they relate to drug sentences is
 
02:46:47.030 --> 02:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
enormous and that ladies and gentlemen
 
02:46:49.969 --> 02:46:49.979 align:start position:0%
is is the real issue here uh it sends
 
02:46:51.889 --> 02:46:51.899 align:start position:0%
the wrong message and the financial
 
02:46:54.290 --> 02:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
impact while we may be concerned about
 
02:46:56.450 --> 02:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
how much money uh it Revenue it's not
 
02:46:58.070 --> 02:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
going to save any money it's not going
 
02:47:00.530 --> 02:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
to save any money at all uh as a matter
 
02:47:02.210 --> 02:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
of fact when we look at the cost in
 
02:47:03.710 --> 02:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
terms of the billions of dollars spent
 
02:47:05.450 --> 02:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
in the Health Care System dealing with
 
02:47:06.889 --> 02:47:06.899 align:start position:0%
this system in a drug treatment
 
02:47:10.429 --> 02:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
prevention it it it it hasn't probably
 
02:47:13.309 --> 02:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
an increase uh in what those costs are
 
02:47:16.910 --> 02:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
so the financial impact uh Mr chair is
 
02:47:18.830 --> 02:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
negligible but the unintended quantity
 
02:47:22.010 --> 02:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
consequences here are enormous
 
02:47:25.309 --> 02:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for your testimony Chief uh
 
02:47:26.650 --> 02:47:26.660 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:47:29.630 --> 02:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative Bromley
 
02:47:32.570 --> 02:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you thank you chief
 
02:47:32.580 --> 02:47:33.349 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you thank you chief
um

02:47:33.349 --> 02:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:35.929 --> 02:47:35.939 align:start position:0%
so now I'm really confused because the
 
02:47:37.969 --> 02:47:37.979 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony said
 
02:47:40.130 --> 02:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
that this had nothing to do with dealers
 
02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
or or traffickers
 
02:47:45.469 --> 02:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
but you I just read what you just said
 
02:47:48.050 --> 02:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
on that first paragraph and it does talk
 
02:47:50.690 --> 02:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
about traffickers and so forth
 
02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
so can you just re-emphasize your point
 
02:47:56.510 --> 02:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
because you feel that this bill does
 
02:48:02.170 --> 02:48:02.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your question
 
02:48:08.750 --> 02:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
um and yes it it most certainly deals
 
02:48:11.929 --> 02:48:11.939 align:start position:0%
with traffickers the the heavy penalties
 
02:48:15.050 --> 02:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
that you see 30 years currently in law
 
02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
um in 20 years currently in law those
 
02:48:21.230 --> 02:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
are sentences related to quantities of
 
02:48:25.210 --> 02:48:25.220 align:start position:0%
drugs controlled drugs that are are
 
02:48:28.309 --> 02:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
not user possession quantities they are
 
02:48:31.070 --> 02:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
trafficking quantities this bill
 
02:48:34.190 --> 02:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
um is flying under false colors in that
 
02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
it attempts to reduce
 
02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
um the the penalties for drug
 
02:48:41.090 --> 02:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
trafficking and not users it most
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
certainly deals in and it's as the first
 
02:48:46.730 --> 02:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
sentences say uh in this bill most
 
02:48:48.349 --> 02:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
certainly addresses director but the
 
02:48:50.330 --> 02:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
quantities involved uh representative
 
02:48:52.610 --> 02:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
are absolutely drug trafficking
 
02:48:55.010 --> 02:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
quantities not drug user quantities and
 
02:48:57.170 --> 02:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony with respect to
 
02:49:01.190 --> 02:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
how much fentanyl can kill a person
 
02:49:03.290 --> 02:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
the amount of fentanyl that can kill a
 
02:49:06.530 --> 02:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
person sits on the head of a pen
 
02:49:09.050 --> 02:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
the head of a pen right that's enough to
 
02:49:11.929 --> 02:49:11.939 align:start position:0%
kill somebody a police officer and other
 
02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
people and again we're dealing with
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
death resulting cases right here in
 
02:49:17.270 --> 02:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
Bedford we're dealing with the tragedy
 
02:49:20.030 --> 02:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
these are not victimless crimes and any
 
02:49:21.889 --> 02:49:21.899 align:start position:0%
deaths resulting from drug trafficking
 
02:49:25.790 --> 02:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
is not a non-violent crime
 
02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:27.650 align:start position:0%
is not a non-violent crime
okay

02:49:27.650 --> 02:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:49:31.130 --> 02:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
thank you okay I have to remind
 
02:49:31.140 --> 02:49:32.870 align:start position:0%
thank you okay I have to remind
um

02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:36.170 --> 02:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
policy has been passed and we still have
 
02:49:38.990 --> 02:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
to concentrate on the revenue aspect of
 
02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:40.429 align:start position:0%
to concentrate on the revenue aspect of
this

02:49:40.429 --> 02:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:49:42.590 --> 02:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
so further questions on the revenue
 
02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:44.270 align:start position:0%
so further questions on the revenue
aspect

02:49:44.270 --> 02:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
02:49:46.250 --> 02:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
whether we like the policy or not
 
02:49:46.260 --> 02:49:48.230 align:start position:0%
whether we like the policy or not
representative

02:49:48.230 --> 02:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:49:53.450 --> 02:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to uh tell the
 
02:49:56.630 --> 02:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
chief of police that he's going to have
 
02:49:59.270 --> 02:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
to go to the Senate because we cannot do
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:07.490 --> 02:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
02:50:07.500 --> 02:50:09.050 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
Southworth

02:50:09.050 --> 02:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
Southworth
 
02:50:12.410 --> 02:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh thank you my questions for the chair
 
02:50:14.929 --> 02:50:14.939 align:start position:0%
yes representative Southwest I know
 
02:50:18.050 --> 02:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
we'll have a work session on this but I
 
02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
think it's really important
 
02:50:23.170 --> 02:50:23.180 align:start position:0%
um that if there is no significant
 
02:50:26.270 --> 02:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
effect on Revenue that that's very clear
 
02:50:30.110 --> 02:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:34.969 --> 02:50:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:37.550 --> 02:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
if we change the
 
02:50:41.410 --> 02:50:41.420 align:start position:0%
fine to some other
 
02:50:43.730 --> 02:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
up or down
 
02:50:45.770 --> 02:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
02:50:48.830 --> 02:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
my question just is so far the testimony
 
02:50:50.809 --> 02:50:50.819 align:start position:0%
has been that there is no significant
 
02:50:50.819 --> 02:50:52.010 align:start position:0%
has been that there is no significant
effect

02:50:52.010 --> 02:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
effect
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
and uh maybe do we use the dra to make
 
02:50:58.610 --> 02:50:58.620 align:start position:0%
sure that that is true except for maybe
 
02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
fewer felony cases which might lower
 
02:51:03.889 --> 02:51:03.899 align:start position:0%
court costs
 
02:51:07.490 --> 02:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
um the dra would not be involved with
 
02:51:11.809 --> 02:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:13.910 --> 02:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm just wondering who will clarify
 
02:51:17.929 --> 02:51:17.939 align:start position:0%
that for our committee I know
 
02:51:19.969 --> 02:51:19.979 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:51:23.990 --> 02:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
and uh I would imagine that we would
 
02:51:25.610 --> 02:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
hash this out
 
02:51:27.770 --> 02:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
02:51:31.130 --> 02:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
work session on those bills that we hear
 
02:51:35.630 --> 02:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
today that it's not clearly what we want
 
02:51:38.090 --> 02:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
to act on and we still have some open
 
02:51:38.100 --> 02:51:41.150 align:start position:0%
to act on and we still have some open
questions

02:51:41.150 --> 02:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:43.250 --> 02:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh anything
 
02:51:46.670 --> 02:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else questions or comments
 
02:51:50.750 --> 02:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
I do see there's another handle
 
02:51:55.490 --> 02:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:59.809 --> 02:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
I don't I haven't seen that name in the
 
02:52:02.570 --> 02:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
list to testify that were sent to me
 
02:52:04.070 --> 02:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
02:52:10.190 --> 02:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:14.570 --> 02:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
do you want me to allow him to talk or
 
02:52:16.550 --> 02:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
um let's listen to what he has to say I
 
02:52:18.050 --> 02:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
want to find out
 
02:52:18.060 --> 02:52:22.370 align:start position:0%
want to find out
okay

02:52:22.370 --> 02:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:24.530 --> 02:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
um good morning still members of the
 
02:52:25.550 --> 02:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for listening to me
 
02:52:28.450 --> 02:52:28.460 align:start position:0%
my name is Joe Hannon
 
02:52:32.330 --> 02:52:32.340 align:start position:0%
sign up to testify I'm sorry when did
 
02:52:35.630 --> 02:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
you sign up to testify uh I don't recall
 
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
I may have I may I may not have I'm not
 
02:52:40.910 --> 02:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
sure I signed up to testify for a lot of
 
02:52:42.469 --> 02:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
bills that it was on my calendar so if I
 
02:52:44.389 --> 02:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
didn't did it or not if I did not sign
 
02:52:46.429 --> 02:52:46.439 align:start position:0%
up I apologize but uh I'm here now I'd
 
02:52:47.750 --> 02:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
like just a minute or two of your time
 
02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
so just apply for or against in favor of
 
02:52:53.809 --> 02:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
02:52:56.210 --> 02:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
Norm Joe Joe's a former State Rep as
 
02:53:00.110 --> 02:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
well oh okay representative Hannon
 
02:53:01.570 --> 02:53:01.580 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:53:04.670 --> 02:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um like uh representative
 
02:53:05.690 --> 02:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
Abram he said I'm a former state
 
02:53:07.610 --> 02:53:07.620 align:start position:0%
representative and retired doctor I'm
 
02:53:10.309 --> 02:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
also a person in long-term recovery uh
 
02:53:13.070 --> 02:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
for over 29 years I'm very actively
 
02:53:14.690 --> 02:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
involved in the recovery Community with
 
02:53:16.490 --> 02:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
several uh recovery organizations and
 
02:53:18.769 --> 02:53:18.779 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities I'm also very
 
02:53:20.090 --> 02:53:20.100 align:start position:0%
active in the harm reduction community
 
02:53:22.070 --> 02:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
02:53:24.650 --> 02:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
um I I'd like to start off by saying you
 
02:53:26.389 --> 02:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
know I know this isn't policy but
 
02:53:28.010 --> 02:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
there's a growing uh body of evidence
 
02:53:30.590 --> 02:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
that longer prison sentences don't mean
 
02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
less crime uh and between 1990 and 2005
 
02:53:36.410 --> 02:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
according to Pew charitable trust time
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
served for drug offenses Rose in New
 
02:53:40.130 --> 02:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 14 percent
 
02:53:42.349 --> 02:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
and the average cost of keeping each
 
02:53:45.290 --> 02:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
offender in prison at that time which is
 
02:53:49.370 --> 02:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
16 years ago was 21 644 dollars per
 
02:53:52.130 --> 02:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
person they kept in prison longer
 
02:53:54.530 --> 02:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh that is a significant cost to the
 
02:53:56.510 --> 02:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
state that was it's pretty much in line
 
02:53:58.969 --> 02:53:58.979 align:start position:0%
with the same uh data that the state had
 
02:54:00.410 --> 02:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
access to they said they hadn't had new
 
02:54:02.450 --> 02:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
data in 15 years and I now I don't feel
 
02:54:03.889 --> 02:54:03.899 align:start position:0%
bad about having old data because they
 
02:54:06.290 --> 02:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
didn't either but um you know that's a
 
02:54:08.269 --> 02:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
significant cost also to the to the
 
02:54:10.130 --> 02:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
quest to the comments about the lethal
 
02:54:12.590 --> 02:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
doses of Fentanyl and Other Drugs
 
02:54:14.450 --> 02:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
um the state routinely sells alcohol in
 
02:54:16.370 --> 02:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
a lethal dose of alcohol is five to
 
02:54:17.870 --> 02:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
eight grams per kilogram of body weight
 
02:54:20.630 --> 02:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's about uh equivalent to a liter or
 
02:54:22.250 --> 02:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
a little more of a bottle of spirits or
 
02:54:23.809 --> 02:54:23.819 align:start position:0%
four bottles of wine can kill someone
 
02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
the state makes hundreds of millions of
 
02:54:28.429 --> 02:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
dollars selling lethal doses of alcohol
 
02:54:30.590 --> 02:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
to people on a daily basis
 
02:54:33.650 --> 02:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
so I I think that uh you know that
 
02:54:35.570 --> 02:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
that's one thing to consider also there
 
02:54:36.950 --> 02:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
was mention from a member of your
 
02:54:40.010 --> 02:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
committee that uh the danger of exposure
 
02:54:41.929 --> 02:54:41.939 align:start position:0%
to police officers and the deaths
 
02:54:44.450 --> 02:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
possibly resulting as a concern and
 
02:54:45.769 --> 02:54:45.779 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been a single documented
 
02:54:47.990 --> 02:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
overdose case from incidental exposure
 
02:54:50.269 --> 02:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
contact with fentanyl that's ever been
 
02:54:53.090 --> 02:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
confirmed or withstood any scrutiny uh
 
02:54:54.769 --> 02:54:54.779 align:start position:0%
we hear a lot of sensationalized stories
 
02:54:55.969 --> 02:54:55.979 align:start position:0%
so I think that's something to take into
 
02:54:57.650 --> 02:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
consideration the cost of keeping people
 
02:55:00.410 --> 02:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
in jail longer is is definitely a cost
 
02:55:02.030 --> 02:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be considered by this
 
02:55:03.469 --> 02:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
committee it was briefly mentioned in
 
02:55:05.330 --> 02:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note but really I think it
 
02:55:07.610 --> 02:55:07.620 align:start position:0%
needs to be examined further and also
 
02:55:09.469 --> 02:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
like representative Conley said the
 
02:55:12.110 --> 02:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
fines that are mentioned here uh that
 
02:55:13.610 --> 02:55:13.620 align:start position:0%
are changing it to it's really just
 
02:55:15.410 --> 02:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
changing it to what the judges already
 
02:55:17.570 --> 02:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
are doing it's not really reducing
 
02:55:17.580 --> 02:55:19.010 align:start position:0%
are doing it's not really reducing
anything

02:55:19.010 --> 02:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:55:21.230 --> 02:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
that's not already happening so this is
 
02:55:24.110 --> 02:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
just almost a uh a procedural change in
 
02:55:25.790 --> 02:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
my mind as far as what the judicial
 
02:55:27.410 --> 02:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
branch is already doing
 
02:55:29.510 --> 02:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
in many ways it may change it from the
 
02:55:31.370 --> 02:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
Superior Court to the Circuit Court but
 
02:55:34.070 --> 02:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh that is also cheaper something for
 
02:55:37.010 --> 02:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
you to consider per case to to prosecute
 
02:55:40.190 --> 02:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
in Circuit Court versus Superior Court
 
02:55:42.830 --> 02:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
02:55:44.510 --> 02:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your testimony
 
02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative Hammond any questions
 
02:55:48.250 --> 02:55:48.260 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:55:50.750 --> 02:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative Allen
 
02:55:54.849 --> 02:55:54.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh honorable Hanan
 
02:55:57.530 --> 02:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
on when
 
02:56:01.670 --> 02:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
this bill obviously does uh reduce the
 
02:56:05.269 --> 02:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
penalties and time in prison for the big
 
02:56:05.279 --> 02:56:06.650 align:start position:0%
penalties and time in prison for the big
dealers

02:56:06.650 --> 02:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
dealers
 
02:56:10.849 --> 02:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
at the same time is it impossible to
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
create a statute which separates the big
 
02:56:17.809 --> 02:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
dealers from the the actual users
 
02:56:19.730 --> 02:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
including a couple of people that deal
 
02:56:23.330 --> 02:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:28.010 --> 02:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
um as far as big dealers I mean it uh I
 
02:56:29.690 --> 02:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
I don't necessarily agree with that
 
02:56:31.730 --> 02:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
terminology because most people that I
 
02:56:33.349 --> 02:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
know that have dealt in New Hampshire
 
02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
that are in recovery and and there's a
 
02:56:37.610 --> 02:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
lot of research out to the shows most
 
02:56:38.870 --> 02:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
people that are dealing are actually
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
users so despite what other people said
 
02:56:43.309 --> 02:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
it's not true uh you do have people
 
02:56:46.130 --> 02:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
dealing just for the sake of profit
 
02:56:48.410 --> 02:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
um this does not say you can't charge
 
02:56:50.809 --> 02:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
them they can still spend 15 years or 20
 
02:56:52.550 --> 02:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
years in jail as opposed to 30 or life
 
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
for first offenses uh that isn't even
 
02:56:56.750 --> 02:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
happening for dealers they're not
 
02:56:58.849 --> 02:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
putting dealers like significant I guess
 
02:57:00.410 --> 02:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
if you want to use that word dealers in
 
02:57:02.030 --> 02:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
jail for that period of time on a
 
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
regular basis in New Hampshire
 
02:57:08.030 --> 02:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
um so you know if if most people that
 
02:57:09.650 --> 02:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
are dealing or doing it to support a
 
02:57:12.710 --> 02:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
habit I think that is uh it's it's a
 
02:57:14.870 --> 02:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a
 
02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's a very not a gray area I think it's
 
02:57:19.250 --> 02:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
a very dark uh Cloud that's put over
 
02:57:20.690 --> 02:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
people that actually have a problem and
 
02:57:22.849 --> 02:57:22.859 align:start position:0%
need help and I think a first offense is
 
02:57:24.530 --> 02:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
the best time to find those people and
 
02:57:25.790 --> 02:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
actually offer them help instead of
 
02:57:28.010 --> 02:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
lengthy unnecessary prison sentences
 
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
that only cost the state money and don't
 
02:57:34.670 --> 02:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:37.370 --> 02:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
you also represent All of Me
 
02:57:39.830 --> 02:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
I think this ought to be discussed in a
 
02:57:41.410 --> 02:57:41.420 align:start position:0%
policy committee so
 
02:57:44.870 --> 02:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you I agree with you
 
02:57:46.490 --> 02:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
um representatively
 
02:57:49.250 --> 02:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what representative Wyoming
 
02:57:52.370 --> 02:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
just said uh this discussion about the
 
02:57:54.950 --> 02:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
drugs and the effects on individuals had
 
02:57:57.290 --> 02:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with uh the amount of
 
02:57:59.510 --> 02:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
money coming uh into the state or the
 
02:58:01.190 --> 02:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
state effects I really don't understand
 
02:58:03.610 --> 02:58:03.620 align:start position:0%
why we're even hearing this bill but
 
02:58:06.110 --> 02:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
that's somebody else's decision thank
 
02:58:07.550 --> 02:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
02:58:10.010 --> 02:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative early any
 
02:58:12.469 --> 02:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
further questions if not
 
02:58:18.490 --> 02:58:18.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:21.469 --> 02:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
Ryan Fowler has his hand raised in
 
02:58:25.190 --> 02:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
attendees well he's already testified
 
02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:26.630 align:start position:0%
attendees well he's already testified
yes

02:58:26.630 --> 02:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:58:32.230 --> 02:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:35.269 --> 02:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm leaving and
 
02:58:37.750 --> 02:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
Ryan and Mr Fowler
 
02:58:42.050 --> 02:58:42.060 align:start position:0%
only speak about the revenue aspects I
 
02:58:43.610 --> 02:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
don't want to hear anything else
 
02:58:46.370 --> 02:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
yes sir I'll make it very brief and it's
 
02:58:47.929 --> 02:58:47.939 align:start position:0%
just in response to the representative
 
02:58:51.230 --> 02:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
from the police Chiefs Union kind of
 
02:58:53.269 --> 02:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
um defending the stance of prohibition
 
02:58:55.370 --> 02:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
and criminalizing is this issue and
 
02:58:57.230 --> 02:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
treating this Health Care issue as a
 
02:58:59.630 --> 02:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
criminal issue and I just would say you
 
02:59:01.130 --> 02:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
know where's the evidence you know
 
02:59:02.570 --> 02:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that prohibition
 
02:59:05.030 --> 02:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
works it's incredibly expensive and when
 
02:59:06.650 --> 02:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
it comes to an actual fiscal note
 
02:59:09.050 --> 02:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
conversation that we could have it would
 
02:59:10.790 --> 02:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
be impossible because jails and prisons
 
02:59:12.650 --> 02:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire don't track recidivism
 
02:59:15.530 --> 02:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to track how
 
02:59:17.210 --> 02:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
effective this is but we know
 
02:59:19.250 --> 02:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
empirically and I have Bodies of
 
02:59:21.230 --> 02:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
Evidence I would support it doesn't work
 
02:59:23.990 --> 02:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
in itself most amounts of money we could
 
02:59:27.230 --> 02:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
be saving sorry sir Mr father just the
 
02:59:29.990 --> 02:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
revenue aspect please
 
02:59:32.510 --> 02:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I know it's just it's hard to have
 
02:59:34.130 --> 02:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
that conversation without tracking
 
02:59:37.190 --> 02:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
recidivism and the efficacy of these
 
02:59:38.929 --> 02:59:38.939 align:start position:0%
very expensive Endeavors like Granite
 
02:59:41.570 --> 02:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
shield and criminalizing folks so if we
 
02:59:43.670 --> 02:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
could compile the cost of what we're
 
02:59:46.550 --> 02:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
doing now we would see cost Savings in
 
02:59:49.010 --> 02:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
reducing criminal charges in court
 
02:59:51.530 --> 02:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
hearings you know uh incarcerating
 
02:59:54.290 --> 02:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
people Etc we just need some numbers to
 
02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
start with and so I want to say we need
 
02:59:58.550 --> 02:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
to track outcomes better
 
03:00:01.309 --> 03:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:00:05.570 --> 03:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:07.910 --> 03:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
sin none
 
03:00:10.910 --> 03:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments from
 
03:00:14.210 --> 03:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
the committee members and then I'm
 
03:00:16.010 --> 03:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
closing the public hearing on House Bill
 
03:00:16.020 --> 03:00:23.870 align:start position:0%
closing the public hearing on House Bill
615.

03:00:23.870 --> 03:00:23.880 align:start position:0%

while so
 
03:00:50.450 --> 03:00:50.460 align:start position:0%

03:00:54.600 --> 03:00:55.910 align:start position:0%
committee is that we take a 30-minute
break

03:00:55.910 --> 03:00:55.920 align:start position:0%

they were only interested in the feed
 
03:32:38.809 --> 03:32:38.819 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
03:32:41.570 --> 03:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
what policy has been passed by the
 
03:32:43.550 --> 03:32:43.560 align:start position:0%

colleagues
 
03:32:52.490 --> 03:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
so to focus on the financials of this
 
03:32:54.889 --> 03:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
bill by the way uh for the record I'm
 
03:32:57.650 --> 03:32:57.660 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Bose of Epping I
 
03:32:59.870 --> 03:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
did submit written testimony on this
 
03:33:02.090 --> 03:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
bill so you have all the full details
 
03:33:06.309 --> 03:33:06.319 align:start position:0%
about the history of of the uh the bill
 
03:33:10.550 --> 03:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
and also the policy issues involved but
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
to focus solely on the financial aspects
 
03:33:16.670 --> 03:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill the bill does reduce an
 
03:33:16.680 --> 03:33:17.929 align:start position:0%
of the bill the bill does reduce an
existing

03:33:17.929 --> 03:33:17.939 align:start position:0%
existing
 
03:33:20.750 --> 03:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
fee charged by the site evaluation
 
03:33:22.210 --> 03:33:22.220 align:start position:0%
committee for
 
03:33:25.190 --> 03:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruins there are two levels
 
03:33:28.670 --> 03:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
of fees one is ten thousand five hundred
 
03:33:30.769 --> 03:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
dollars for a ruling from the full
 
03:33:30.779 --> 03:33:31.790 align:start position:0%
dollars for a ruling from the full
committee

03:33:31.790 --> 03:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:33:33.410 --> 03:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
and there's another one that's three
 
03:33:36.050 --> 03:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars from a for a ruling
 
03:33:37.910 --> 03:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
from a subcommittee of the full
 
03:33:37.920 --> 03:33:39.530 align:start position:0%
from a subcommittee of the full
committee

03:33:39.530 --> 03:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:33:42.410 --> 03:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
this bill reduces that fee to 250
 
03:33:45.250 --> 03:33:45.260 align:start position:0%
dollars regardless of whether you get a
 
03:33:48.530 --> 03:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or a full committee uh
 
03:33:51.590 --> 03:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling
 
03:33:53.330 --> 03:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge there have only been
 
03:33:55.969 --> 03:33:55.979 align:start position:0%
three declaratory rulings requested of
 
03:33:57.490 --> 03:33:57.500 align:start position:0%
the committee since
 
03:34:01.190 --> 03:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
2015. so the financial impact of this
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
bill will be extremely small
 
03:34:07.610 --> 03:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
now the site evaluation committee and Ms
 
03:34:10.130 --> 03:34:10.140 align:start position:0%
Diane Martin the who is chair of the
 
03:34:12.650 --> 03:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee as well as the
 
03:34:14.510 --> 03:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
chair of the Public Utilities Commission
 
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
is on the call I believe she was earlier
 
03:34:19.670 --> 03:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
anyway she can tell you the exact
 
03:34:22.550 --> 03:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
amounts but the site evaluation
 
03:34:25.610 --> 03:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
committee does request general fund fun
 
03:34:27.229 --> 03:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
funding every year
 
03:34:30.469 --> 03:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
the amounts vary I believe they have
 
03:34:33.530 --> 03:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
requested 250 000 from this year's
 
03:34:35.990 --> 03:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
budget Ms Martin can correct me if I'm
 
03:34:39.889 --> 03:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
wrong about that in past years they have
 
03:34:42.590 --> 03:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
gotten general fund amounts of 450
 
03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred thousand three
 
03:34:47.990 --> 03:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
hundred eighty thousand various uh and
 
03:34:50.030 --> 03:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
Sundry amounts
 
03:34:53.630 --> 03:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
so that's the financial impact of the
 
03:34:55.610 --> 03:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
bill and I'd be happy to answer any
 
03:34:55.620 --> 03:34:56.929 align:start position:0%
bill and I'd be happy to answer any
questions

03:34:56.929 --> 03:34:56.939 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:35:01.870 --> 03:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:04.370 --> 03:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
I've done an army followed by
 
03:35:06.229 --> 03:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative abramny
 
03:35:09.769 --> 03:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chairman on
 
03:35:12.110 --> 03:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative votes do you have any
 
03:35:18.530 --> 03:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
comment on the cec's uh uh reply in the
 
03:35:22.389 --> 03:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:26.690 --> 03:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
I'll have to look that up uh I'll try to
 
03:35:29.450 --> 03:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
do that and uh I'll get back to you
 
03:35:32.710 --> 03:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:36.530 --> 03:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
okay it essentially says that this is
 
03:35:41.330 --> 03:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
going to cost us more money and uh give
 
03:35:47.870 --> 03:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
us less money and it may make uh
 
03:35:52.070 --> 03:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
make uh we will result in may result in
 
03:35:54.170 --> 03:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
the need for additional meetings of the
 
03:35:55.490 --> 03:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
committee therefore increasing
 
03:36:02.269 --> 03:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:05.690 --> 03:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the fiscal report uh
 
03:36:10.910 --> 03:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
now and my response would be that in
 
03:36:14.030 --> 03:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
the past what six years since 2015 there
 
03:36:15.590 --> 03:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
have only been a request for three
 
03:36:17.929 --> 03:36:17.939 align:start position:0%
declaratory rules
 
03:36:19.990 --> 03:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm not even sure if they were
 
03:36:22.010 --> 03:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
requests for a full committee
 
03:36:23.690 --> 03:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling but let's say they
 
03:36:27.370 --> 03:36:27.380 align:start position:0%
were that would be about 31
 
03:36:32.450 --> 03:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
500 that the committee uh has taken in
 
03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
if you will from declaratory rulings
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
over the past six years
 
03:36:40.729 --> 03:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
and uh I can't imagine that if they're
 
03:36:43.389 --> 03:36:43.399 align:start position:0%
getting general fund funding every year
 
03:36:48.790 --> 03:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
of from 250 to 500 000 dollars that uh
 
03:36:52.670 --> 03:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
depriving them of the few dollars that
 
03:36:54.729 --> 03:36:54.739 align:start position:0%
this declaratory ruling
 
03:36:56.450 --> 03:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
fee drop
 
03:36:59.150 --> 03:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
would result in will have that much
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
effect on their operations
 
03:37:05.630 --> 03:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
now you could argue I suppose that
 
03:37:09.410 --> 03:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
lowering the fee will stimulate more
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling requests but there's
 
03:37:16.190 --> 03:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
no there's been no indication uh from
 
03:37:20.269 --> 03:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard that such a an
 
03:37:23.570 --> 03:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
increase would occur
 
03:37:26.870 --> 03:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
hello Mr chairman oh
 
03:37:26.880 --> 03:37:28.070 align:start position:0%
hello Mr chairman oh
on

03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:37:31.969 --> 03:37:31.979 align:start position:0%
wasn't this the reason that they were on
 
03:37:34.809 --> 03:37:34.819 align:start position:0%
decreasing the fee because it would keep
 
03:37:38.510 --> 03:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
ordinary citizens from being able to ask
 
03:37:41.809 --> 03:37:41.819 align:start position:0%
for a hearing to have to pay 10 000
 
03:37:41.819 --> 03:37:43.490 align:start position:0%
for a hearing to have to pay 10 000
something

03:37:43.490 --> 03:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the reason the policy
 
03:37:49.070 --> 03:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
reason for decreasing the fee is to
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
increase the transparency and the
 
03:37:54.469 --> 03:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
accessibility of the committee to people
 
03:37:57.229 --> 03:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
who otherwise not be able might not be
 
03:37:58.269 --> 03:37:58.279 align:start position:0%
able to
 
03:38:01.190 --> 03:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
request such a really because the fees
 
03:38:06.769 --> 03:38:06.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:08.990 --> 03:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bromley
 
03:38:10.550 --> 03:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
I think you answered part of my question
 
03:38:13.370 --> 03:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
with that last response because there's
 
03:38:16.490 --> 03:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
five let's here are five different
 
03:38:16.500 --> 03:38:17.750 align:start position:0%
five let's here are five different
um

03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:17.760 --> 03:38:19.070 align:start position:0%
um
filings

03:38:19.070 --> 03:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
filings
 
03:38:21.830 --> 03:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
petition for committee jurisdiction when
 
03:38:22.910 --> 03:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about petition for
 
03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling certificates transfer
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
of ownership repressive exemption
 
03:38:31.429 --> 03:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
requests to modify certif uh certificate
 
03:38:33.290 --> 03:38:33.300 align:start position:0%
and they all seem to be basically the
 
03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
same with the exception of the first one
 
03:38:37.610 --> 03:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
which is just ten thousand five hundred
 
03:38:39.950 --> 03:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
for a full committee review
 
03:38:43.969 --> 03:38:43.979 align:start position:0%
so is there from a pure workload
 
03:38:43.979 --> 03:38:45.170 align:start position:0%
so is there from a pure workload
standpoint

03:38:45.170 --> 03:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
forget about the fact that there's
 
03:38:48.349 --> 03:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
there's a political discussion that we
 
03:38:51.170 --> 03:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
just had about allowing lowering the
 
03:38:53.929 --> 03:38:53.939 align:start position:0%
feed so that more people can file but
 
03:38:55.550 --> 03:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
from a workload standpoint is there a
 
03:38:58.370 --> 03:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
different amount of work associated
 
03:39:00.110 --> 03:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh for the state of for the site
 
03:39:02.570 --> 03:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee related to each of
 
03:39:04.150 --> 03:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
these five different
 
03:39:07.849 --> 03:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:10.370 --> 03:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
I'll have to defer to Ms Martin to
 
03:39:12.530 --> 03:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
answer that question I don't know what
 
03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
the workload of the SEC is for
 
03:39:17.809 --> 03:39:17.819 align:start position:0%
anything to be honest with you okay I'll
 
03:39:20.090 --> 03:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
ask her thank you
 
03:39:23.510 --> 03:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a question representative
 
03:39:26.640 --> 03:39:28.790 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a question representative
Ames

03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
03:39:28.800 --> 03:39:29.750 align:start position:0%
Ames
um

03:39:29.750 --> 03:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:33.050 --> 03:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for coming back
 
03:39:33.060 --> 03:39:34.510 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for coming back
again

03:39:34.510 --> 03:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:39:39.170 --> 03:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
so the question is um whether testimony
 
03:39:42.349 --> 03:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
was or other documents were provided to
 
03:39:43.969 --> 03:39:43.979 align:start position:0%
your committee when you were reviewing
 
03:39:44.990 --> 03:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:39:48.469 --> 03:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
on the question of how much it actually
 
03:39:48.479 --> 03:39:49.849 align:start position:0%
on the question of how much it actually
costs

03:39:49.849 --> 03:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:39:55.010 --> 03:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
set evaluation committee to address a
 
03:39:57.650 --> 03:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
sort of an average if there's such a
 
03:39:59.630 --> 03:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
thing an average request for a
 
03:40:04.250 --> 03:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:06.650 --> 03:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
so there was no testimony that indicated
 
03:40:10.610 --> 03:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
how much it cost to process
 
03:40:14.450 --> 03:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
a declaratory ruling it depends on the
 
03:40:17.750 --> 03:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
request a declaratory ruling passes
 
03:40:22.070 --> 03:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
judgment on uh usually a complaint filed
 
03:40:26.210 --> 03:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
against an energy projects owner for
 
03:40:29.630 --> 03:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
violating its site certificate
 
03:40:29.640 --> 03:40:31.070 align:start position:0%
violating its site certificate
and

03:40:31.070 --> 03:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:40:33.950 --> 03:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
um so it it depends you know it probably
 
03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
changes from request to request
 
03:40:38.690 --> 03:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
depending on what the nature of the
 
03:40:41.570 --> 03:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:42.790 --> 03:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:46.809 --> 03:40:46.819 align:start position:0%
well no thank you thank you
 
03:40:50.389 --> 03:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative Union
 
03:40:52.969 --> 03:40:52.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:40:55.010 --> 03:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative DeVos for
 
03:40:56.389 --> 03:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
um my question is when I look at the
 
03:41:01.490 --> 03:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
estimated on the fiscal note the
 
03:41:04.190 --> 03:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
estimated increase or decrease
 
03:41:05.450 --> 03:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little surprised it's
 
03:41:08.030 --> 03:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
indeterminable only because we must have
 
03:41:10.670 --> 03:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
historical data on roughly how many of
 
03:41:10.680 --> 03:41:11.570 align:start position:0%
historical data on roughly how many of
these

03:41:11.570 --> 03:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:41:14.450 --> 03:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
um declaratory rulings are made each
 
03:41:16.670 --> 03:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
year and then therefore taking the
 
03:41:16.680 --> 03:41:18.290 align:start position:0%
year and then therefore taking the
reductions

03:41:18.290 --> 03:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
03:41:19.670 --> 03:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
um isn't there a way to get that
 
03:41:19.680 --> 03:41:23.090 align:start position:0%
um isn't there a way to get that
information

03:41:23.090 --> 03:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:25.729 --> 03:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
well and I would imagine there is we
 
03:41:27.469 --> 03:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
could certainly ask the site evaluation
 
03:41:29.929 --> 03:41:29.939 align:start position:0%
committee the last time
 
03:41:32.510 --> 03:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
I asked that question of the then
 
03:41:35.150 --> 03:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
administrator Pamela Moore now she told
 
03:41:38.330 --> 03:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
me there had been three requests since
 
03:41:38.340 --> 03:41:42.710 align:start position:0%
me there had been three requests since
2015.

03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up all
 
03:41:49.610 --> 03:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
so um then obviously if three requests
 
03:41:50.990 --> 03:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about a huge
 
03:41:54.530 --> 03:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
difference in money but therefore is is
 
03:41:57.349 --> 03:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
the idea of dropping to so either people
 
03:41:59.929 --> 03:41:59.939 align:start position:0%
really aren't interested in
 
03:42:02.269 --> 03:42:02.279 align:start position:0%
that you know to a great degree of
 
03:42:05.210 --> 03:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
getting these declaratory rulings or is
 
03:42:07.429 --> 03:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
is it the belief that there's a lot of
 
03:42:09.290 --> 03:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
people that want them but the price is
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
just too high
 
03:42:13.670 --> 03:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
we did hear testimony to that effect
 
03:42:16.190 --> 03:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
although I wouldn't characterize
 
03:42:18.110 --> 03:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
that there were a lot of people who
 
03:42:19.210 --> 03:42:19.220 align:start position:0%
wanted them
 
03:42:22.910 --> 03:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
the issue is when somebody does want a
 
03:42:25.729 --> 03:42:25.739 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling if it's too expensive
 
03:42:28.210 --> 03:42:28.220 align:start position:0%
for an average citizens to to get that
 
03:42:31.309 --> 03:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling then they're
 
03:42:33.290 --> 03:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
essentially locked out of the process
 
03:42:35.870 --> 03:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
which makes the whole site evaluation
 
03:42:38.570 --> 03:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
committee process less transparent and
 
03:42:40.630 --> 03:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
less accessible to the general public
 
03:42:44.090 --> 03:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
which diminishes and this is a poly use
 
03:42:46.429 --> 03:42:46.439 align:start position:0%
policy if you're not a financial one but
 
03:42:48.849 --> 03:42:48.859 align:start position:0%
it diminishes The
 
03:42:51.170 --> 03:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
credibility of the site evaluation
 
03:42:53.150 --> 03:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
committee if people don't trust that
 
03:42:55.070 --> 03:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
they're doing what they're supposed to
 
03:42:57.349 --> 03:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
do correctly if they can't see what
 
03:42:59.929 --> 03:42:59.939 align:start position:0%
they're doing and how can they trust and
 
03:43:02.030 --> 03:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
know what they're doing
 
03:43:05.870 --> 03:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up all so I guess my my
 
03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
concern then would be I I certainly uh
 
03:43:11.650 --> 03:43:11.660 align:start position:0%
transparency is certainly always a plus
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
I guess my concern would be we have no
 
03:43:16.130 --> 03:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
way of knowing whether this will
 
03:43:19.429 --> 03:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
overwhelm the system by dropping the
 
03:43:19.439 --> 03:43:20.110 align:start position:0%
overwhelm the system by dropping the
the

03:43:20.110 --> 03:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:43:22.729 --> 03:43:22.739 align:start position:0%
fee so low
 
03:43:24.650 --> 03:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
or do we
 
03:43:26.929 --> 03:43:26.939 align:start position:0%
no we do not have any way of knowing but
 
03:43:26.939 --> 03:43:28.070 align:start position:0%
no we do not have any way of knowing but
uh

03:43:28.070 --> 03:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:43:30.889 --> 03:43:30.899 align:start position:0%
if we use history as a guide if there
 
03:43:33.110 --> 03:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
have been three requests over the past
 
03:43:36.050 --> 03:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
six years that's an average of one-half
 
03:43:38.510 --> 03:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
request per year then
 
03:43:40.969 --> 03:43:40.979 align:start position:0%
um we can we can estimate that there
 
03:43:43.010 --> 03:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
will be no the system will not be
 
03:43:43.020 --> 03:43:46.010 align:start position:0%
will be no the system will not be
overwhelmed

03:43:46.010 --> 03:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:50.050 --> 03:43:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:52.610 --> 03:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
representative Bromley
 
03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you again
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chair this question
 
03:44:00.229 --> 03:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
kind of gets to understanding what the
 
03:44:02.330 --> 03:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
collaboratory ruling is so that we
 
03:44:03.710 --> 03:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
better have make a better judgment about
 
03:44:06.769 --> 03:44:06.779 align:start position:0%
what that fee should be so can I ask the
 
03:44:10.010 --> 03:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
question yes what exactly is a petition
 
03:44:14.210 --> 03:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.269 --> 03:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
it asks typically it asks a question of
 
03:44:20.090 --> 03:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee about the
 
03:44:22.910 --> 03:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
about whether a site certificates terms
 
03:44:27.110 --> 03:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
and conditions are being met or violated
 
03:44:27.120 --> 03:44:28.309 align:start position:0%
and conditions are being met or violated
okay

03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:30.250 --> 03:44:30.260 align:start position:0%
that helps thank you
 
03:44:36.290 --> 03:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:40.809 --> 03:44:40.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:43.070 --> 03:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:44:45.229 --> 03:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm wrestling with the question
 
03:44:48.110 --> 03:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
of how can it go
 
03:44:50.510 --> 03:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
from costing ten thousand or three
 
03:44:52.849 --> 03:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars down to two hundred and
 
03:44:54.530 --> 03:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars
 
03:44:56.990 --> 03:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
do they get a refund those people that
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
paid the ten thousand dollars
 
03:45:02.809 --> 03:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
I I mean how much does this actually
 
03:45:06.170 --> 03:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
cost do you know
 
03:45:08.150 --> 03:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
I was asked that question earlier thank
 
03:45:10.849 --> 03:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
you representative Elliott and I
 
03:45:14.090 --> 03:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
deferred it to Ms Martin she can do a
 
03:45:16.010 --> 03:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
better job of explaining exactly how
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
much it costs the committee to perform
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
one of these uh declaratory ruling
 
03:45:27.309 --> 03:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
um to create a declaratory ruling uh
 
03:45:32.150 --> 03:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:42.170 --> 03:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
okay since I see no other hands and
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
would you let
 
03:45:51.290 --> 03:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:51.300 --> 03:46:06.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:46:06.550 --> 03:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:09.769 --> 03:46:09.779 align:start position:0%
valuation committee she's neutral on
 
03:46:14.510 --> 03:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
this and she wants to testify it
 
03:46:16.610 --> 03:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
03:46:18.830 --> 03:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Diane Martin and as
 
03:46:20.690 --> 03:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
you've heard I am the chairwoman of the
 
03:46:23.389 --> 03:46:23.399 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee as well as the
 
03:46:26.389 --> 03:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and I am
 
03:46:28.130 --> 03:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
here today essentially to answer your
 
03:46:30.469 --> 03:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
questions I know that there have been a
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
lot of questions that I just heard
 
03:46:34.670 --> 03:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
related to funding past
 
03:46:37.130 --> 03:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
um number of these types of proceedings
 
03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
and that kind of thing so I'm happy to
 
03:46:41.150 --> 03:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
answer any and all of those questions to
 
03:46:43.490 --> 03:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
the extent I have that information with
 
03:46:46.910 --> 03:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
me I guess the first question is how
 
03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
much does it cost for a declaratory
 
03:46:48.960 --> 03:46:50.330 align:start position:0%
much does it cost for a declaratory
judgment

03:46:50.330 --> 03:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
03:46:53.210 --> 03:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've had three as
 
03:46:55.790 --> 03:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative both said um historically
 
03:46:58.670 --> 03:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
and I will preface all this by saying I
 
03:47:02.690 --> 03:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
became the chair of both in the end of
 
03:47:05.570 --> 03:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
2019. so I actually have not had
 
03:47:08.570 --> 03:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling come before me during
 
03:47:12.410 --> 03:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
that time but prior to my joining there
 
03:47:15.950 --> 03:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
were three and the numbers that I have
 
03:47:15.960 --> 03:47:17.229 align:start position:0%
were three and the numbers that I have
um

03:47:17.229 --> 03:47:17.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:19.729 --> 03:47:19.739 align:start position:0%
they range from
 
03:47:23.210 --> 03:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
a little bit under two thousand dollars
 
03:47:26.450 --> 03:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
in costs associated with it and the most
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
expensive the one with the highest cost
 
03:47:34.130 --> 03:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
billed to and paid by the SEC was 10 898
 
03:47:37.250 --> 03:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
dollars so it's a range and I think that
 
03:47:40.190 --> 03:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
gets to the question somebody else asked
 
03:47:43.370 --> 03:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
which is what does it take to do one of
 
03:47:46.250 --> 03:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
these types of proceedings and and I
 
03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
think the issue for the society
 
03:47:52.610 --> 03:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and funding it is
 
03:47:56.809 --> 03:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
that it's not ever the same most cases
 
03:47:59.630 --> 03:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
are entirely different and so you may be
 
03:48:02.809 --> 03:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
able to resolve one case in just a few
 
03:48:06.110 --> 03:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
proceedings and others may take
 
03:48:08.269 --> 03:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
um a significant number of proceedings
 
03:48:10.309 --> 03:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
so it really depends upon the question
 
03:48:13.030 --> 03:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
that comes before the committee
 
03:48:15.889 --> 03:48:15.899 align:start position:0%
and another piece I just want to quickly
 
03:48:18.710 --> 03:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
explain is the committee is made up of
 
03:48:22.010 --> 03:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
both agency members state agency members
 
03:48:25.370 --> 03:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
and those are very high level members
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
so your Department of Transportation
 
03:48:30.290 --> 03:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
commissioner is on the committee and
 
03:48:34.010 --> 03:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
it's not her or designee it's her so we
 
03:48:36.050 --> 03:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
have to have that commissioner if we're
 
03:48:37.550 --> 03:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
going to have a public meeting of that
 
03:48:37.560 --> 03:48:38.809 align:start position:0%
going to have a public meeting of that
committee

03:48:38.809 --> 03:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:48:40.670 --> 03:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
um your Des commissioner is the vice
 
03:48:43.610 --> 03:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
chair I'm the chair it's it's a lot of
 
03:48:45.229 --> 03:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
people who also have a lot of other
 
03:48:48.170 --> 03:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
things going on and so
 
03:48:48.180 --> 03:48:49.370 align:start position:0%
things going on and so
um

03:48:49.370 --> 03:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:52.550 --> 03:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
those folks only get reimbursed for the
 
03:48:56.690 --> 03:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
state expenses after three days of worth
 
03:48:58.010 --> 03:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
of proceedings
 
03:49:01.070 --> 03:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh you also have public members who have
 
03:49:03.530 --> 03:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
to be compensated for all of their time
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
and every commit subcommittee has public
 
03:49:08.750 --> 03:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
members so there's always going to be an
 
03:49:11.809 --> 03:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
expense associated with whatever we do
 
03:49:15.229 --> 03:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
in addition the statute provides for an
 
03:49:15.239 --> 03:49:16.670 align:start position:0%
in addition the statute provides for an
administrator

03:49:16.670 --> 03:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
03:49:19.510 --> 03:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
who obviously would be a consistent
 
03:49:23.210 --> 03:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
expense throughout so
 
03:49:23.220 --> 03:49:24.469 align:start position:0%
expense throughout so
um

03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:26.929 --> 03:49:26.939 align:start position:0%
costs can vary I guess that's my point
 
03:49:28.729 --> 03:49:28.739 align:start position:0%
and if there's no real way of saying
 
03:49:31.969 --> 03:49:31.979 align:start position:0%
what what one of these would cost
 
03:49:35.210 --> 03:49:35.220 align:start position:0%
you mentioned administrator do you have
 
03:49:37.429 --> 03:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
an administrator at present where you're
 
03:49:40.729 --> 03:49:40.739 align:start position:0%
not having these declaratory judgments
 
03:49:43.690 --> 03:49:43.700 align:start position:0%
uh no the position is vacant and that's
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
another Point worth making there is no
 
03:49:50.090 --> 03:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
other staff for the committee and so
 
03:49:50.100 --> 03:49:51.710 align:start position:0%
other staff for the committee and so
essentially

03:49:51.710 --> 03:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:49:53.990 --> 03:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
um it's me
 
03:49:56.510 --> 03:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
03:50:00.710 --> 03:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
so do you stack up when when required
 
03:50:03.050 --> 03:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh the the administrator had been in
 
03:50:04.849 --> 03:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
place for a few years and she just took
 
03:50:08.210 --> 03:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
another position in the fall there was a
 
03:50:11.510 --> 03:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze and we also did not have
 
03:50:13.610 --> 03:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
General funding
 
03:50:17.150 --> 03:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
um in this biennium there was instead a
 
03:50:19.790 --> 03:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
footnote that provided for me to go to
 
03:50:22.250 --> 03:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal if the fees were not sufficient
 
03:50:25.070 --> 03:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
and so I I actually just went a couple
 
03:50:28.670 --> 03:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
weeks ago for the first time and I was
 
03:50:31.790 --> 03:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
um given about ninety five thousand
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
dollars for the fiscal year for this
 
03:50:37.010 --> 03:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
operation and that covered the majority
 
03:50:39.530 --> 03:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
of that was to cover the expenses for
 
03:50:41.570 --> 03:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
that administrator while she was
 
03:50:43.729 --> 03:50:43.739 align:start position:0%
actually there
 
03:50:47.870 --> 03:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh representative bronney
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
um so when you look at the five types of
 
03:50:55.130 --> 03:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
uh filing fees that are listed in the
 
03:50:58.849 --> 03:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
bill here only one is being changed uh
 
03:51:01.610 --> 03:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
how do you how do you compare
 
03:51:03.769 --> 03:51:03.779 align:start position:0%
one to the other in terms of the average
 
03:51:05.330 --> 03:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
amount of work
 
03:51:08.889 --> 03:51:08.899 align:start position:0%
is a declaratory ruling petition
 
03:51:12.110 --> 03:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh less than the others
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
are there is there any one type of you
 
03:51:17.090 --> 03:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
know uh petition for committee
 
03:51:19.309 --> 03:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction certificate of transfer of
 
03:51:19.319 --> 03:51:20.150 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction certificate of transfer of
ownership

03:51:20.150 --> 03:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
03:51:20.160 --> 03:51:21.290 align:start position:0%
ownership
et cetera

03:51:21.290 --> 03:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
et cetera
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
they tend to take more time than than
 
03:51:26.210 --> 03:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
the petition for declaratory ruling in
 
03:51:26.220 --> 03:51:28.130 align:start position:0%
the petition for declaratory ruling in
general

03:51:28.130 --> 03:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:51:30.950 --> 03:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
applications for certificates are I
 
03:51:32.990 --> 03:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
think by far the most expensive and that
 
03:51:35.450 --> 03:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
would be things like we just had the
 
03:51:38.870 --> 03:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
Chinook solar project and and so there
 
03:51:41.330 --> 03:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
was an application for being related to
 
03:51:43.969 --> 03:51:43.979 align:start position:0%
that obviously Northern Pass was one of
 
03:51:46.490 --> 03:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
the one of the applications for
 
03:51:49.729 --> 03:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
certificate those tend to be larger
 
03:51:52.630 --> 03:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
um proceedings that go on for longer uh
 
03:51:54.889 --> 03:51:54.899 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling I think just based
 
03:51:57.950 --> 03:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
upon the numbers I'm seeing they they
 
03:51:59.630 --> 03:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
look like they tend to be less
 
03:52:02.750 --> 03:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
significant in the um amount of
 
03:52:06.550 --> 03:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
resources required to accomplish them
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
an example of follow-up
 
03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh let's use the Northern Pass example
 
03:52:15.290 --> 03:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh what was that under that was a
 
03:52:15.300 --> 03:52:16.490 align:start position:0%
uh what was that under that was a
certificate

03:52:16.490 --> 03:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
03:52:18.349 --> 03:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
yes that was an application for
 
03:52:20.990 --> 03:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
certificate right so clearly that that
 
03:52:23.450 --> 03:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
that went well beyond the ten thousand
 
03:52:26.870 --> 03:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
five hundred that's here correct in
 
03:52:28.969 --> 03:52:28.979 align:start position:0%
terms of what it cost actual expense is
 
03:52:32.809 --> 03:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
that correct yes uh
 
03:52:35.510 --> 03:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh the application fee for that was
 
03:52:38.510 --> 03:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
actually and these are not definite
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
numbers but this is what I have in front
 
03:52:41.809 --> 03:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
of me six hundred and twenty six
 
03:52:45.530 --> 03:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars right so there's really
 
03:52:47.570 --> 03:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
these fees seem to have been said a
 
03:52:48.769 --> 03:52:48.779 align:start position:0%
while ago and they all seem to be
 
03:52:51.290 --> 03:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
basically the same
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
03:52:56.210 --> 03:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
and it's really hard to compare apples
 
03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
to apples here it appears that there are
 
03:53:01.910 --> 03:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
some that that will exceed
 
03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
the ten thousand five hundred no
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
question most of the time is that is
 
03:53:07.790 --> 03:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
that a correct statement
 
03:53:10.670 --> 03:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
some of the different uh tapes that are
 
03:53:13.309 --> 03:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
set forth in the statute yes absolutely
 
03:53:17.330 --> 03:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
I think the majority will exceed that
 
03:53:20.929 --> 03:53:20.939 align:start position:0%
the 10 500 that currently is established
 
03:53:22.849 --> 03:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
for the petition
 
03:53:22.859 --> 03:53:23.510 align:start position:0%
for the petition
um

03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:26.269 --> 03:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
I think in this case it's really just
 
03:53:29.809 --> 03:53:29.819 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to highlight is that these
 
03:53:31.929 --> 03:53:31.939 align:start position:0%
fees don't
 
03:53:34.550 --> 03:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily cover the costs and so
 
03:53:37.729 --> 03:53:37.739 align:start position:0%
reducing the fee will obviously
 
03:53:39.769 --> 03:53:39.779 align:start position:0%
um create a greater disparity to the
 
03:53:39.779 --> 03:53:40.610 align:start position:0%
um create a greater disparity to the
extent

03:53:40.610 --> 03:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
extent
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
that they don't cover the cost thank you
 
03:53:46.849 --> 03:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:50.870 --> 03:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
um I have further question on that
 
03:53:55.729 --> 03:53:55.739 align:start position:0%
under section two as the filing fees
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
in those five different filing fees and
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
we're dealing only with the declarative
 
03:54:06.170 --> 03:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
ruling but the other four the fees are
 
03:54:08.809 --> 03:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
essentially the same how much activities
 
03:54:13.309 --> 03:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:16.250 --> 03:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh petition for committee jurisdiction
 
03:54:19.969 --> 03:54:19.979 align:start position:0%
we have one that was just filed i i in
 
03:54:22.490 --> 03:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
the time that I've been at the at the
 
03:54:22.500 --> 03:54:24.530 align:start position:0%
the time that I've been at the at the
SEC

03:54:24.530 --> 03:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
SEC
 
03:54:26.090 --> 03:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
um there has been
 
03:54:28.490 --> 03:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
from my perspective very little activity
 
03:54:32.330 --> 03:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
for new types of applications or filing
 
03:54:35.689 --> 03:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
so we had the Chinook solar filing we've
 
03:54:37.070 --> 03:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
now got a petition for committee
 
03:54:37.080 --> 03:54:38.750 align:start position:0%
now got a petition for committee
jurisdiction

03:54:38.750 --> 03:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
03:54:38.760 --> 03:54:40.250 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
um

03:54:40.250 --> 03:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:43.130 --> 03:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
and that's all we've had since I came in
 
03:54:46.610 --> 03:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
in 2019. I think the distinction and the
 
03:54:49.130 --> 03:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
issue that is also at play is that there
 
03:54:49.140 --> 03:54:50.330 align:start position:0%
issue that is also at play is that there
is

03:54:50.330 --> 03:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:54:53.150 --> 03:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
um a requirement of compliance with the
 
03:54:55.729 --> 03:54:55.739 align:start position:0%
certificate as representative Bose
 
03:54:59.809 --> 03:54:59.819 align:start position:0%
mentioned and so that involves post
 
03:55:04.610 --> 03:55:04.620 align:start position:0%
certificate uh work you you won't see a
 
03:55:07.070 --> 03:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
filing fee related to that because there
 
03:55:08.630 --> 03:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
isn't one
 
03:55:11.689 --> 03:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
um and so there's just an ongoing issue
 
03:55:14.090 --> 03:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
I think related to the funding of this
 
03:55:16.189 --> 03:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
committee for and the work that needs to
 
03:55:17.870 --> 03:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
be done
 
03:55:22.849 --> 03:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
only five different types of
 
03:55:26.210 --> 03:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
committee uh Juris uh
 
03:55:29.630 --> 03:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
petition for committee jurisdiction for
 
03:55:31.429 --> 03:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
declarative ruling
 
03:55:34.010 --> 03:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
certificate transfer request for
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
exemption request to modify are they
 
03:55:40.309 --> 03:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
handled by the same people or different
 
03:55:40.319 --> 03:55:41.650 align:start position:0%
handled by the same people or different
people

03:55:41.650 --> 03:55:41.660 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:55:44.689 --> 03:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
so there is a group that makes up the
 
03:55:47.030 --> 03:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
committee it's it's state agency members
 
03:55:48.910 --> 03:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
and public
 
03:55:52.610 --> 03:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
appointees and so essentially if it's a
 
03:55:55.130 --> 03:55:55.140 align:start position:0%
public meeting it's generally the the
 
03:55:58.670 --> 03:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
whole committee if it's one of these and
 
03:56:01.790 --> 03:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee is permitted then then I
 
03:56:03.710 --> 03:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
I can determine
 
03:56:06.530 --> 03:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
which to use and assign a subcommittee
 
03:56:09.650 --> 03:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
so it does vary although the committee
 
03:56:12.290 --> 03:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
is consistent
 
03:56:15.950 --> 03:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
and do they fade into one fund or they
 
03:56:18.530 --> 03:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
have five separate funds oh the fees all
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
proceeding but it goes into that fund
 
03:56:32.450 --> 03:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
and then it's expended from that fund
 
03:56:35.990 --> 03:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
so then what would I say then that the
 
03:56:38.269 --> 03:56:38.279 align:start position:0%
other four
 
03:56:43.130 --> 03:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
sets of fees then would offset any loss
 
03:56:47.269 --> 03:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
for the Declaration will increase
 
03:56:50.630 --> 03:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
if there were an excess that could be
 
03:56:50.640 --> 03:56:52.370 align:start position:0%
if there were an excess that could be
possible

03:56:52.370 --> 03:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:56:52.380 --> 03:56:53.030 align:start position:0%
possible
um

03:56:53.030 --> 03:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:54.769 --> 03:56:54.779 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been my experience since
 
03:56:56.929 --> 03:56:56.939 align:start position:0%
being there because we haven't had a lot
 
03:57:00.170 --> 03:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
of filings or a petition for committee
 
03:57:02.689 --> 03:57:02.699 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that we just received was
 
03:57:05.630 --> 03:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
filed by a group of residents and under
 
03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
the statute that allows for filing
 
03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
without a fee and so we need to do that
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
proceeding which will have a cost but
 
03:57:17.450 --> 03:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
there is no fee related to that for
 
03:57:19.429 --> 03:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
those types of filers
 
03:57:23.210 --> 03:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you on I'm getting more questions
 
03:57:29.570 --> 03:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
as we go along on it says here in the
 
03:57:32.330 --> 03:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
statute that committee jurisdiction is
 
03:57:35.570 --> 03:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
10 500 but you just said somewhere in
 
03:57:38.389 --> 03:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
the statute I guess that if it is a
 
03:57:40.610 --> 03:57:40.620 align:start position:0%
group of community members which I
 
03:57:43.729 --> 03:57:43.739 align:start position:0%
thought is what this was about on that
 
03:57:45.889 --> 03:57:45.899 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay anything
 
03:57:48.290 --> 03:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
yes and I apologize I don't have that
 
03:57:51.110 --> 03:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
Statute in front of me at the moment but
 
03:57:53.990 --> 03:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
um yes if if it is filed
 
03:57:58.070 --> 03:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
um with a number of residents signing a
 
03:58:00.830 --> 03:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
petition there will be no fee if the
 
03:58:04.130 --> 03:58:04.140 align:start position:0%
committee accepts jurisdiction and the
 
03:58:07.030 --> 03:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
project goes forward that fee can be
 
03:58:09.469 --> 03:58:09.479 align:start position:0%
assigned to the actual
 
03:58:09.479 --> 03:58:10.309 align:start position:0%
assigned to the actual
um

03:58:10.309 --> 03:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:13.729 --> 03:58:13.739 align:start position:0%
company doing the project but if the
 
03:58:15.290 --> 03:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
Comm if the committee does not accept
 
03:58:17.150 --> 03:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that proceeding will have
 
03:58:17.160 --> 03:58:18.050 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that proceeding will have
had

03:58:18.050 --> 03:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:58:22.189 --> 03:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:22.199 --> 03:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:58:23.460 --> 03:58:23.470 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:23.470 --> 03:58:25.010 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

03:58:25.010 --> 03:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:58:31.010 --> 03:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
so in any of these cases on if it is
 
03:58:33.650 --> 03:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
community members who put together a
 
03:58:38.510 --> 03:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
petition on then they don't have to file
 
03:58:43.849 --> 03:58:43.859 align:start position:0%
for a fee and if uh the ruling
 
03:58:49.610 --> 03:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
is against on them then uh there would
 
03:58:52.610 --> 03:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
be no money for the work you've done if
 
03:58:55.250 --> 03:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
the ruling was for them then the company
 
03:58:57.650 --> 03:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
would have to compensate would have to
 
03:58:59.090 --> 03:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
pay the fee
 
03:59:01.790 --> 03:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
you've got that right except that it is
 
03:59:05.689 --> 03:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
limited to number one in the list on
 
03:59:08.330 --> 03:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
section two
 
03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
um no I'm yes number one petition for
 
03:59:13.189 --> 03:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
committee jurisdiction the ten thousand
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollar fee that
 
03:59:18.469 --> 03:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
um is the one where that applies it does
 
03:59:21.710 --> 03:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
not apply in this in the petition for
 
03:59:23.510 --> 03:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling
 
03:59:23.520 --> 03:59:25.729 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling
setting

03:59:25.729 --> 03:59:25.739 align:start position:0%
setting
 
03:59:28.429 --> 03:59:28.439 align:start position:0%
could could I ask a further follow-up
 
03:59:33.950 --> 03:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
just quickly follow up thank you on so
 
03:59:38.090 --> 03:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
if we put that same stipulation into
 
03:59:42.290 --> 03:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
number two which apparently would be the
 
03:59:44.809 --> 03:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
community getting together to say look
 
03:59:48.110 --> 03:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
this company said that it was not going
 
03:59:51.410 --> 03:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
to create a ash pit that could come down
 
03:59:53.689 --> 03:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
and go into our River or something like
 
03:59:58.010 --> 03:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
that on then um they would not have to
 
03:59:58.020 --> 03:59:59.269 align:start position:0%
that on then um they would not have to
pay

03:59:59.269 --> 03:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
pay
 
04:00:02.450 --> 04:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
to file that petition
 
04:00:05.330 --> 04:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
could we put that in to there as well
 
04:00:07.610 --> 04:00:07.620 align:start position:0%
and how would we do it
 
04:00:09.650 --> 04:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
you could certainly create something
 
04:00:13.309 --> 04:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
that would um be similar to that I have
 
04:00:15.650 --> 04:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
I haven't looked at you know how that
 
04:00:19.250 --> 04:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
would best be done but I think you could
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
certainly apply something like that to
 
04:00:24.889 --> 04:00:24.899 align:start position:0%
this I'm trying to think about how
 
04:00:26.689 --> 04:00:26.699 align:start position:0%
I suppose if you
 
04:00:28.490 --> 04:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
well the problem is a petition for
 
04:00:32.210 --> 04:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling really is uh related
 
04:00:34.729 --> 04:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
to the applicability of the statutes or
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
rules to um
 
04:00:42.290 --> 04:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
to the petitioner and so
 
04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
there are other statutes that play
 
04:00:46.550 --> 04:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
related to what what were I'll call a
 
04:00:46.560 --> 04:00:47.950 align:start position:0%
related to what what were I'll call a
complaint

04:00:47.950 --> 04:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
162h12 is called enforcement and it
 
04:00:53.809 --> 04:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
provides for a determination that a
 
04:00:53.819 --> 04:00:54.550 align:start position:0%
provides for a determination that a
condition

04:00:54.550 --> 04:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
condition
 
04:00:57.830 --> 04:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
or term of the certificate is not being
 
04:01:02.750 --> 04:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:05.450 --> 04:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's a declaratory
 
04:01:07.610 --> 04:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
ruling I think there are differing
 
04:01:10.849 --> 04:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
opinions and and I raise the point to
 
04:01:15.050 --> 04:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
say under 162h12 enforcement there is no
 
04:01:18.170 --> 04:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
fee for bringing that um
 
04:01:20.809 --> 04:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
for bringing a complaint and and the
 
04:01:23.510 --> 04:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
action is taken by the committee to
 
04:01:25.550 --> 04:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
determine whether there's been a
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
violation so
 
04:01:29.650 --> 04:01:29.660 align:start position:0%
I just want to be careful about
 
04:01:32.450 --> 04:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
suggesting that petition for declaratory
 
04:01:36.130 --> 04:01:36.140 align:start position:0%
ruling is the only way in which a
 
04:01:38.750 --> 04:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
lack of compliance
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
by a company with
 
04:01:47.450 --> 04:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:47.460 --> 04:01:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
represents

04:01:53.430 --> 04:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:53.440 --> 04:01:55.010 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:01:55.010 --> 04:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
my question is um so as I look at these
 
04:02:02.450 --> 04:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
it looks like if the full committee
 
04:02:04.849 --> 04:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
rules on
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
um you know whichever whichever aspect
 
04:02:09.410 --> 04:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
it is whether it's one two three four
 
04:02:10.969 --> 04:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
five then it's a ten thousand five
 
04:02:12.110 --> 04:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar
 
04:02:14.210 --> 04:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
uh fee and it looks like if it's a
 
04:02:16.370 --> 04:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
three-member board for items two through
 
04:02:18.130 --> 04:02:18.140 align:start position:0%
five it would only be three thousand
 
04:02:21.769 --> 04:02:21.779 align:start position:0%
presumably because the cost is less so
 
04:02:24.469 --> 04:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm noticing the change to this rule
 
04:02:28.250 --> 04:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
is that uh or not rule but this uh area
 
04:02:31.610 --> 04:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
of the law would be 250 with no
 
04:02:33.769 --> 04:02:33.779 align:start position:0%
discrimination between a full Committee
 
04:02:36.710 --> 04:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
hearing it and a three-member uh
 
04:02:39.290 --> 04:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so I guess I'd like your
 
04:02:40.429 --> 04:02:40.439 align:start position:0%
opinion on
 
04:02:44.210 --> 04:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't it make sense for
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if the full committee is
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
hearing it it's it's three times
 
04:02:49.370 --> 04:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
whatever the cost is you know if we
 
04:02:51.889 --> 04:02:51.899 align:start position:0%
agree with the 250 then it would be 750
 
04:02:54.590 --> 04:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
I suppose for the full committee 250 for
 
04:02:59.090 --> 04:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
the free number and you know I mean I'm
 
04:03:00.469 --> 04:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
presumably because the cost is a lot
 
04:03:02.929 --> 04:03:02.939 align:start position:0%
more for the full community to hear it
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
the costs are without question higher if
 
04:03:07.490 --> 04:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
you have a full committee because you'll
 
04:03:10.250 --> 04:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
have more public members on the full
 
04:03:13.670 --> 04:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
committee and um
 
04:03:17.090 --> 04:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
you're going to have all you know
 
04:03:19.370 --> 04:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
a larger number of folks who would have
 
04:03:22.130 --> 04:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
to be paid particularly if it goes more
 
04:03:24.110 --> 04:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
than three days so
 
04:03:25.969 --> 04:03:25.979 align:start position:0%
um I think there is a distinction in
 
04:03:29.030 --> 04:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
cost whether you reflect that in the fee
 
04:03:32.450 --> 04:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
is is in the legislature's purview but I
 
04:03:34.790 --> 04:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
think that the the point I'm
 
04:03:36.590 --> 04:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
trying to make is that in either
 
04:03:41.150 --> 04:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
scenario 750 250 it won't fund the cost
 
04:03:46.250 --> 04:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
of of that proceeding it will fall short
 
04:03:49.610 --> 04:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
I want to clarify on the
 
04:03:49.620 --> 04:03:50.809 align:start position:0%
I want to clarify on the
um

04:03:50.809 --> 04:03:50.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:53.090 --> 04:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
on the general funds
 
04:03:55.130 --> 04:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
again I wasn't there in the last
 
04:03:58.010 --> 04:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
biennium but there was a
 
04:03:58.020 --> 04:03:59.150 align:start position:0%
biennium but there was a
um

04:03:59.150 --> 04:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:03.110 --> 04:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
a footnote that requires oh that in this
 
04:04:04.670 --> 04:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
by ending there's a footnote so there
 
04:04:06.650 --> 04:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
were no General funds appropriated as
 
04:04:08.870 --> 04:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
part of the biennial budget there was a
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
footnote saying if there weren't enough
 
04:04:13.010 --> 04:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
fees you need to go to fiscal and get
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
funding in the prior biennium there was
 
04:04:17.040 --> 04:04:19.010 align:start position:0%
funding in the prior biennium there was
a

04:04:19.010 --> 04:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
provision in the law that said that uh
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
up to I believe 480 000 could be spent
 
04:04:30.010 --> 04:04:30.020 align:start position:0%
from the renewable energy fund and so
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
that money in the prior biennium came
 
04:04:35.210 --> 04:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
from the renewable energy fund as
 
04:04:39.790 --> 04:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:43.429 --> 04:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
representative Bernstein
 
04:04:45.530 --> 04:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Ms
 
04:04:47.809 --> 04:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
Martin for taking my question
 
04:04:50.570 --> 04:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
um so let me see if I have this correct
 
04:04:53.809 --> 04:04:53.819 align:start position:0%
if I file petition by myself it could
 
04:04:55.790 --> 04:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
cost ten thousand five hundred or maybe
 
04:04:57.650 --> 04:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars
 
04:05:00.590 --> 04:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
to follow that but if I get my friend
 
04:05:03.170 --> 04:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
let's say uh representative Malloy to
 
04:05:05.630 --> 04:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
file with me then there's no fee
 
04:05:05.640 --> 04:05:08.330 align:start position:0%
file with me then there's no fee
whatsoever

04:05:08.330 --> 04:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:08.340 --> 04:05:13.309 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:05:13.309 --> 04:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:16.309 --> 04:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
citizens than than two that the I wish I
 
04:05:17.809 --> 04:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
had the statute in front of me and I
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
apologize I can get you that information
 
04:05:23.389 --> 04:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
but it is a larger group of residents
 
04:05:25.849 --> 04:05:25.859 align:start position:0%
that have to join together sign a
 
04:05:28.130 --> 04:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
petition and that has to be presented to
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
the committee but again that only
 
04:05:32.450 --> 04:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
relates to petitions for committee
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so it does not relate to
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
the petition declaratory ruling
 
04:05:40.370 --> 04:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
provision that's being amended here okay
 
04:05:42.110 --> 04:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
if you if you could get us the details
 
04:05:43.969 --> 04:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
on that I would appreciate that I will
 
04:05:44.809 --> 04:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:05:45.830 --> 04:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:05:49.210 --> 04:05:49.220 align:start position:0%
um all you follow up
 
04:05:51.469 --> 04:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
I know you haven't been there that long
 
04:05:54.290 --> 04:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
but how many times have you heard an
 
04:05:56.269 --> 04:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
individual say hey I would have filed
 
04:05:58.130 --> 04:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
but I just can't afford
 
04:05:59.929 --> 04:05:59.939 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
04:06:01.729 --> 04:06:01.739 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to determine maybe what
 
04:06:04.490 --> 04:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
elasticity of demand is and
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
I I have not heard that and I have not
 
04:06:08.870 --> 04:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
heard that said while I've been there
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
but like I said there has been a
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
what I would consider a lull in filings
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
generally for the SEC there have only
 
04:06:19.250 --> 04:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
been two during the entire time I've
 
04:06:20.210 --> 04:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
been there
 
04:06:23.210 --> 04:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
04:06:25.849 --> 04:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
uh representative spilsbury
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
science technology committee split 1110
 
04:06:40.849 --> 04:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
and that the difference uh between those
 
04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
two uh groups was simply over whether
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
this reduction should also apply to
 
04:06:49.309 --> 04:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
business interests in other words it
 
04:06:50.750 --> 04:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
looked like they were all comfortable
 
04:06:54.590 --> 04:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
with what we're in the fee for residents
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
but they were divided on the question of
 
04:06:58.130 --> 04:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
business interests is that even a
 
04:07:02.570 --> 04:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:04.610 --> 04:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
I think it could be a workable
 
04:07:04.620 --> 04:07:06.050 align:start position:0%
I think it could be a workable
distinction

04:07:06.050 --> 04:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
04:07:06.060 --> 04:07:07.429 align:start position:0%
distinction
um

04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:09.290 --> 04:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
I mean I think the legislature could
 
04:07:11.809 --> 04:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
Define these kinds of things however
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
however they want to like they did with
 
04:07:17.330 --> 04:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
the groups of uh residents you could
 
04:07:20.389 --> 04:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
come up with categories of folks for for
 
04:07:24.830 --> 04:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:28.030 --> 04:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
and follow up please
 
04:07:31.490 --> 04:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
so if the distinction was workable on
 
04:07:34.490 --> 04:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
some level would it make sense that the
 
04:07:35.870 --> 04:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
disparity be
 
04:07:39.290 --> 04:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
250 on the one hand and 10 500 on the
 
04:07:41.689 --> 04:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
other hand or if the distinction was
 
04:07:44.090 --> 04:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
being made would there be some different
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
set of figures that would make more
 
04:07:45.720 --> 04:07:48.710 align:start position:0%
set of figures that would make more
sense

04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:52.070 --> 04:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
um I think whether the legislature wants
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
to make it easier to access the
 
04:08:00.130 --> 04:08:00.140 align:start position:0%
committee for certain types of filings
 
04:08:03.650 --> 04:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
for for certain groups of people
 
04:08:05.870 --> 04:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
I think that's a decision for the
 
04:08:08.929 --> 04:08:08.939 align:start position:0%
legislature to make if they were to do
 
04:08:08.939 --> 04:08:10.370 align:start position:0%
legislature to make if they were to do
that

04:08:10.370 --> 04:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:10.380 --> 04:08:11.809 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:08:11.809 --> 04:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:13.429 --> 04:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
I think it really depends on what your
 
04:08:15.650 --> 04:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
goal is do you want the business to pay
 
04:08:17.929 --> 04:08:17.939 align:start position:0%
the full costs in line with what I get
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
read you earlier
 
04:08:22.790 --> 04:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
um and the lower fee to really not
 
04:08:24.410 --> 04:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
reflect costs it really I think it
 
04:08:26.090 --> 04:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
really depends upon what the goal of the
 
04:08:31.010 --> 04:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
legislature is related to doing that
 
04:08:33.790 --> 04:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative followed by
 
04:08:38.330 --> 04:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
representative Bromley
 
04:08:41.210 --> 04:08:41.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on I'm getting
 
04:08:43.610 --> 04:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
more and more confused about what
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling is the petitions the
 
04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
three petitions earlier where they filed
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
all by
 
04:08:57.309 --> 04:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
by what you'd call on business interests
 
04:09:00.889 --> 04:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
opposed or for the project that they
 
04:09:02.570 --> 04:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
were talking about
 
04:09:02.580 --> 04:09:03.769 align:start position:0%
were talking about
on

04:09:03.769 --> 04:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
I had thought that it was supposed to be
 
04:09:09.110 --> 04:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
a complaint about non-compliance after
 
04:09:11.870 --> 04:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
the fact but it appears that that's done
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
04:09:19.250 --> 04:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
so there was one filed by it was a
 
04:09:21.110 --> 04:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
petition for declaratory ruling of the
 
04:09:25.090 --> 04:09:25.100 align:start position:0%
antrimwin opponents that was the 10
 
04:09:29.210 --> 04:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
898 dollar cost there was a petition for
 
04:09:32.689 --> 04:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling brought by
 
04:09:35.210 --> 04:09:35.220 align:start position:0%
17 towns
 
04:09:39.010 --> 04:09:39.020 align:start position:0%
and in that case the costs were
 
04:09:41.510 --> 04:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
5936 dollars
 
04:09:41.520 --> 04:09:43.250 align:start position:0%
5936 dollars
and

04:09:43.250 --> 04:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:46.429 --> 04:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
the last one was a petition
 
04:09:48.650 --> 04:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
for declaratory ruling of New Hampshire
 
04:09:51.530 --> 04:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
transmission LLC which would be an
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
entity and that was the least expensive
 
04:09:57.290 --> 04:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
at one thousand six hundred forty four
 
04:10:00.290 --> 04:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
dollars so I think the answer is it's
 
04:10:04.790 --> 04:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:04.800 --> 04:10:24.410 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:10:24.410 --> 04:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:25.550 --> 04:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
actually have a question for
 
04:10:27.290 --> 04:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
representative Voss when we're at that
 
04:10:27.300 --> 04:10:30.590 align:start position:0%
representative Voss when we're at that
point

04:10:30.590 --> 04:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:30.600 --> 04:10:32.889 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:10:32.889 --> 04:10:32.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
maybe continue dialogue
 
04:10:38.330 --> 04:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
so representative Austin to take the
 
04:10:38.340 --> 04:10:39.229 align:start position:0%
so representative Austin to take the
question

04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:10:42.050 --> 04:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
yes I'll take any questions I just want
 
04:10:45.390 --> 04:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
to uh clarify representative spilsbury
 
04:10:45.400 --> 04:10:45.769 align:start position:0%
to uh clarify representative spilsbury
[Music]

gave us a vote tally from your committee
 
04:10:50.929 --> 04:10:50.939 align:start position:0%
but I I just double checked
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
it looked like it passed out of your
 
04:10:53.630 --> 04:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
committee this bill passed out of your
 
04:10:56.269 --> 04:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
committee 19 to 1.
 
04:10:58.490 --> 04:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
am I correct on that I'm looking at that
 
04:11:01.250 --> 04:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
was in it that was a typo in the house
 
04:11:03.110 --> 04:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
calendar it should have been 11 to
 
04:11:05.570 --> 04:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
nothing with the typo right yeah what
 
04:11:07.010 --> 04:11:07.020 align:start position:0%

eleven to nine it was eleven nine okay

04:12:00.170 --> 04:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
representative Bromley are you through
 
04:12:04.130 --> 04:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
your question uh well another question
 
04:12:08.769 --> 04:12:08.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:10.910 --> 04:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
yes that's fine
 
04:12:15.050 --> 04:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
uh representative Army posed um
 
04:12:17.150 --> 04:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
different solution
 
04:12:19.849 --> 04:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
uh to this uh I just wanted your
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
I refresh my memory with her
 
04:12:29.570 --> 04:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:29.580 --> 04:12:30.769 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:12:30.769 --> 04:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:32.450 --> 04:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
it was to treat it like one of the
 
04:12:32.460 --> 04:12:33.650 align:start position:0%
it was to treat it like one of the
others

04:12:33.650 --> 04:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
others
 
04:12:33.660 --> 04:12:34.550 align:start position:0%
others
um

04:12:34.550 --> 04:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:39.370 --> 04:12:39.380 align:start position:0%
section one right the section one
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
remember zombie can you can you help me
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
out and
 
04:12:43.439 --> 04:12:44.229 align:start position:0%
out and
uh

04:12:44.229 --> 04:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:12:48.050 --> 04:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
yes we've been told that petition for
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
Community Committee jurisdiction on
 
04:12:56.750 --> 04:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
is on the fun the fee is not required
 
04:12:59.150 --> 04:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
when it is community members doing a
 
04:12:59.160 --> 04:13:01.550 align:start position:0%
when it is community members doing a
petition

04:13:01.550 --> 04:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:05.450 --> 04:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
which if it was applied to to petition
 
04:13:08.809 --> 04:13:08.819 align:start position:0%
for declaratory ruling on it for the
 
04:13:11.389 --> 04:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
past three that they've had two of those
 
04:13:13.010 --> 04:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
groups would not would have been
 
04:13:14.870 --> 04:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
Community groups and they would not have
 
04:13:21.530 --> 04:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:25.150 --> 04:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
so is the question is that an acceptable
 
04:13:29.650 --> 04:13:29.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.150 --> 04:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
yes that would be my question
 
04:13:35.389 --> 04:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
okay I would say uh that would depend on
 
04:13:37.250 --> 04:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
the number of people who are required to
 
04:13:39.469 --> 04:13:39.479 align:start position:0%
sign the petition there are situations
 
04:13:41.990 --> 04:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
where uh
 
04:13:44.090 --> 04:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
and I can give you a concrete example if
 
04:13:47.210 --> 04:13:47.220 align:start position:0%
you want the Antrim win project in
 
04:13:51.050 --> 04:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
antrum there are Butters who live near
 
04:13:53.929 --> 04:13:53.939 align:start position:0%
those wind turbines who believe that
 
04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
those turbines are exceeding their sound
 
04:13:56.279 --> 04:13:57.349 align:start position:0%
those turbines are exceeding their sound
limits

04:13:57.349 --> 04:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
limits
 
04:14:00.290 --> 04:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
but there may not be enough of them to
 
04:14:03.050 --> 04:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
qualify for a petition I don't know what
 
04:14:05.929 --> 04:14:05.939 align:start position:0%
the number of of petitioners has to be
 
04:14:08.030 --> 04:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
but Ms Martin made it sound like that
 
04:14:11.630 --> 04:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's more than just a few so that would
 
04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
preclude those people from uh making a
 
04:14:16.849 --> 04:14:16.859 align:start position:0%
complaint to the site evaluation
 
04:14:18.650 --> 04:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
committee and I think that's wrong I
 
04:14:20.090 --> 04:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
think that
 
04:14:23.689 --> 04:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
um these people need to have access to
 
04:14:25.309 --> 04:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:14:27.769 --> 04:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
to address their complaints number one
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
and also to make the rest of us have uh
 
04:14:34.729 --> 04:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
a reasonable amount of trust that the
 
04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee is doing its
 
04:14:41.150 --> 04:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
job to protect people from
 
04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
energy projects that don't follow their
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:52.729 --> 04:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
would you suggest a number
 
04:14:59.330 --> 04:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:01.969 --> 04:15:01.979 align:start position:0%
number of practitioners
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:11.269 --> 04:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:15.530 --> 04:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.410 --> 04:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh let's see if
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
there's anybody else
 
04:15:20.640 --> 04:15:33.229 align:start position:0%
there's anybody else
testify

04:15:33.229 --> 04:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
I don't see anybody signed up on the
 
04:15:37.010 --> 04:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
attendee list
 
04:15:39.410 --> 04:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
so there's no further questions and I'm
 
04:15:41.870 --> 04:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on
 
04:15:50.990 --> 04:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:54.410 --> 04:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
on the discussion thus far today
 
04:15:57.410 --> 04:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
on the five bills that we hurt
 
04:15:59.750 --> 04:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
looks like we need a general work
 
04:15:59.760 --> 04:16:01.790 align:start position:0%
looks like we need a general work
session

04:16:01.790 --> 04:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
and I'll look at that scheduled
 
04:16:05.279 --> 04:16:09.610 align:start position:0%
and I'll look at that scheduled
foreign

04:16:09.610 --> 04:16:09.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:12.729 --> 04:16:12.739 align:start position:0%

we have connect relative to including
 
04:16:37.490 --> 04:16:37.500 align:start position:0%

motor vehicle rentals and facilitators
 
04:16:47.590 --> 04:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
of Internet transactions of room offices
 
04:16:51.590 --> 04:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative Baxter have come up with
 
04:16:53.210 --> 04:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
04:16:57.229 --> 04:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
I believe the latest amendment is uh
 
04:17:00.229 --> 04:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment 0599h
 
04:17:05.929 --> 04:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:07.849 --> 04:17:07.859 align:start position:0%

04:17:15.110 --> 04:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
zero five nine nine H I'm I'm not sure
 
04:17:17.389 --> 04:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
which one is which office hop my head Mr
 
04:17:19.670 --> 04:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
chair but I did just want to ask I know
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Newman sent you an email
 
04:17:25.550 --> 04:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
about if we could caucus on hb15 before
 
04:17:27.410 --> 04:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
we had a work session
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and I'd just like to request that as
 
04:17:29.040 --> 04:17:31.849 align:start position:0%
um and I'd just like to request that as
well

04:17:31.849 --> 04:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:31.859 --> 04:17:32.809 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:17:32.809 --> 04:17:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:38.030 --> 04:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
we can talk us if we were at the LOB
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
but to be able to caucus now we have to
 
04:17:42.650 --> 04:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
terminate the meeting
 
04:17:46.849 --> 04:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
uh I uh I think what we should do is
 
04:17:49.189 --> 04:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole
 
04:17:51.950 --> 04:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
continue the discussion
 
04:17:53.630 --> 04:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:17:55.309 --> 04:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
when we meet
 
04:17:55.319 --> 04:17:59.510 align:start position:0%
when we meet
tomorrow

04:17:59.510 --> 04:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:02.809 --> 04:18:02.819 align:start position:0%
well when the committee as a whole
 
04:18:05.809 --> 04:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
place the discussion we will
 
04:18:05.819 --> 04:18:07.250 align:start position:0%
place the discussion we will
ask

04:18:07.250 --> 04:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
ask
 
04:18:07.260 --> 04:18:10.030 align:start position:0%
ask
the

04:18:10.030 --> 04:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:10.040 --> 04:18:11.809 align:start position:0%
the
Democrats

04:18:11.809 --> 04:18:11.819 align:start position:0%
Democrats
 
04:18:13.130 --> 04:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
to leave
 
04:18:15.710 --> 04:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
and Republicans to stay and then we can
 
04:18:20.030 --> 04:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
caucus and then continue our discussion
 
04:18:22.689 --> 04:18:22.699 align:start position:0%
after the caucus
 
04:18:27.110 --> 04:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
we meet tomorrow excuse me
 
04:18:30.050 --> 04:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair just to clarify are you
 
04:18:32.090 --> 04:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we should caucus after
 
04:18:35.990 --> 04:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
today's meeting or tomorrow well after
 
04:18:38.269 --> 04:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
today's meeting
 
04:18:41.090 --> 04:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
because if we if we terminated our
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
meeting right now
 
04:18:46.309 --> 04:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
then we as a committee as a whole we
 
04:18:48.410 --> 04:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
couldn't discuss it
 
04:18:51.349 --> 04:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be discussing house bill 15.
 
04:18:53.210 --> 04:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
I would like to
 
04:18:55.969 --> 04:18:55.979 align:start position:0%
discuss how spell 15 as a committee as a
 
04:18:59.450 --> 04:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
whole to see what all the issues are
 
04:19:02.750 --> 04:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
and then after that and then we'll end
 
04:19:11.150 --> 04:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:14.210 --> 04:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
German major yes
 
04:19:14.220 --> 04:19:14.809 align:start position:0%
German major yes
um

04:19:14.809 --> 04:19:14.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:17.929 --> 04:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
somehow we can't see you anymore
 
04:19:20.809 --> 04:19:20.819 align:start position:0%
oh I forgot my oh it's your folder oh
 
04:19:25.130 --> 04:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
okay sorry sorry about that
 
04:19:25.140 --> 04:19:28.670 align:start position:0%
okay sorry sorry about that
um

04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:30.050 --> 04:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
yeah we wouldn't be voting until
 
04:19:31.729 --> 04:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
tomorrow though we wouldn't be voting
 
04:19:35.090 --> 04:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
until tomorrow correct if we voted so we
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
will not be voting today it would be
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
voting tomorrow
 
04:19:41.450 --> 04:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair I want to hear what what
 
04:19:43.490 --> 04:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
Hershel Nunes representative news thinks
 
04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
about that but I think that should be
 
04:19:47.150 --> 04:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
fine and I'm gonna pull up the um the
 
04:19:49.309 --> 04:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
amendment number for you real quick
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay and so we will have a work session
 
04:19:56.450 --> 04:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
on Hospital 15 as a full committee
 
04:19:59.929 --> 04:19:59.939 align:start position:0%
and then after the work session
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
and we've closed the work session and we
 
04:20:06.469 --> 04:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
can hold a caucus
 
04:20:09.889 --> 04:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
inside uh what a position would be for
 
04:20:13.309 --> 04:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and we hopefully we can execut
 
04:20:16.849 --> 04:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
them I hope
 
04:20:20.269 --> 04:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
just a question uh
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're on a public we're in a
 
04:20:25.429 --> 04:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
public meeting on this
 
04:20:28.729 --> 04:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
um site that we're on however you refer
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
to it and I'm I'm I want to be sure that
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
you can transition as you suggested into
 
04:20:38.290 --> 04:20:38.300 align:start position:0%
a republican caucus without
 
04:20:40.849 --> 04:20:40.859 align:start position:0%
leaving this meeting and convening your
 
04:20:43.490 --> 04:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
own meeting what I would do and I would
 
04:20:46.610 --> 04:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
try this is that all the Democrats drop
 
04:20:46.620 --> 04:20:47.809 align:start position:0%
try this is that all the Democrats drop
off

04:20:47.809 --> 04:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
off
 
04:20:49.729 --> 04:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
and then make sure there are no
 
04:20:49.739 --> 04:20:51.050 align:start position:0%
and then make sure there are no
attendees

04:20:51.050 --> 04:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
attendees
 
04:20:53.469 --> 04:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
and the only ones left would be
 
04:20:55.790 --> 04:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
Republicans and then we could hold our
 
04:21:01.689 --> 04:21:01.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
drop off
 
04:21:05.689 --> 04:21:05.699 align:start position:0%
and then I would have to send a link to
 
04:21:07.429 --> 04:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
the Republican members
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
and hold on
 
04:21:11.990 --> 04:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
a caucus later on in the afternoon
 
04:21:13.550 --> 04:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative major I'm sorry for
 
04:21:15.290 --> 04:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
interrupting but but that is what you
 
04:21:17.450 --> 04:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
will have to do we will have to turn off
 
04:21:19.010 --> 04:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
this meeting
 
04:21:20.150 --> 04:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
um we're not we're not able to
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
facilitate caucuses okay then that's
 
04:21:25.070 --> 04:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
what I will do
 
04:21:27.530 --> 04:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
after this meeting I would send a link
 
04:21:30.530 --> 04:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
to the Republican members
 
04:21:33.469 --> 04:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
to meet for a caucus later this
 
04:21:33.479 --> 04:21:37.610 align:start position:0%
to meet for a caucus later this
afternoon

04:21:37.610 --> 04:21:37.620 align:start position:0%

conversation
representative

04:21:53.929 --> 04:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:55.969 --> 04:21:55.979 align:start position:0%

04:22:01.010 --> 04:22:01.020 align:start position:0%

um Mr chairman uh I I agree with uh
 
04:22:11.929 --> 04:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
representative Baxter I do think that we
 
04:22:13.309 --> 04:22:13.319 align:start position:0%

04:22:14.570 --> 04:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
work session today we'll just be
 
04:22:16.370 --> 04:22:16.380 align:start position:0%

we want to bring up to you
 
04:22:26.809 --> 04:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:26.819 --> 04:22:28.910 align:start position:0%

what this extra information is but I
 
04:22:43.250 --> 04:22:43.260 align:start position:0%

I

04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:25:04.309 --> 04:25:04.319 align:start position:0%

all right just give me one moment I'll
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
pull that up for you guys
 
04:25:20.330 --> 04:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
and we need to know that dra has seen it
 
04:25:32.630 --> 04:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:34.729 --> 04:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
well we're waiting for it to come up I
 
04:25:37.670 --> 04:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify is this the same
 
04:25:40.070 --> 04:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that we looked at and we will
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
ask last discussing hi boys that's
 
04:25:49.070 --> 04:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
correct okay so and we've discussed this
 
04:25:52.070 --> 04:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and dra was here and it was maybe
 
04:25:54.729 --> 04:25:54.739 align:start position:0%
they've had more thought about it
 
04:25:57.410 --> 04:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand why we're
 
04:25:59.510 --> 04:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
going to go forward with more discussion
 
04:26:02.210 --> 04:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
when it's clear that
 
04:26:05.090 --> 04:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
the on the Republican side there needs
 
04:26:06.769 --> 04:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
to be a discussion
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what representative
 
04:26:12.290 --> 04:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:12.300 --> 04:26:13.550 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:26:13.550 --> 04:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative Baxter is going to have
 
04:26:16.849 --> 04:26:16.859 align:start position:0%
it pulled up
 
04:26:19.729 --> 04:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:21.889 --> 04:26:21.899 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chair I do have the amendment
 
04:26:21.899 --> 04:26:22.969 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chair I do have the amendment
now

04:26:22.969 --> 04:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:26:25.729 --> 04:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
um so I can't pull it up if I have the
 
04:26:28.189 --> 04:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
um ability to share the screen but I
 
04:26:29.689 --> 04:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
know representative all me as well
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
suggested that we're going to need a
 
04:26:34.610 --> 04:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
work session tomorrow based off what
 
04:26:37.130 --> 04:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
comes from our caucus and to
 
04:26:40.309 --> 04:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
representative ames's point it may make
 
04:26:42.410 --> 04:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
more sense to have one work session
 
04:26:44.149 --> 04:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
instead of two but I'll leave that to
 
04:26:45.950 --> 04:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair as well as the fellow
 
04:27:09.290 --> 04:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:09.300 --> 04:27:12.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:16.790 --> 04:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
can you uh see my screen Mr chair yo can
 
04:27:18.790 --> 04:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
you um
 
04:27:21.649 --> 04:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
to make it a little smaller so we can
 
04:27:24.910 --> 04:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
see more of it there's not many lines
 
04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
how about that is that better right
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%

04:27:34.490 --> 04:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
all right make it a little bit larger
 
04:27:40.510 --> 04:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:43.550 --> 04:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
let's go let's go up on it
 
04:27:46.510 --> 04:27:46.520 align:start position:0%

04:27:49.070 --> 04:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
right there right there that's it
 
04:27:56.170 --> 04:27:56.180 align:start position:0%

04:28:10.680 --> 04:28:11.630 align:start position:0%
written uh by dra
um

04:28:11.630 --> 04:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:14.510 --> 04:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
same same Amendment the purpose is to
 
04:28:17.689 --> 04:28:17.699 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not taxing Travel
 
04:28:20.090 --> 04:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
Service agents and the change from my
 
04:28:22.070 --> 04:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
original amendment is extent of
 
04:28:25.309 --> 04:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
exempting by occupation it exempts by
 
04:28:28.370 --> 04:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
the service provided so we don't wholly
 
04:28:28.380 --> 04:28:29.929 align:start position:0%
the service provided so we don't wholly
exempt

04:28:29.929 --> 04:28:29.939 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
04:28:36.590 --> 04:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:36.600 --> 04:28:45.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:28:45.250 --> 04:28:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:48.170 --> 04:28:48.180 align:start position:0%
thank you again I'm not sure exactly
 
04:28:50.210 --> 04:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
what we're doing right now my
 
04:28:52.910 --> 04:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is that dra does not feel
 
04:28:55.790 --> 04:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
that an amendment is necessary and so
 
04:29:00.469 --> 04:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:00.479 --> 04:29:01.929 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:29:01.929 --> 04:29:01.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:06.110 --> 04:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
Carolyn or Melissa do you have a comment
 
04:29:10.929 --> 04:29:10.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:14.090 --> 04:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
or would it help
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:22.010 --> 04:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
hi representative Mrs Carolyn Lear
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner with the New
 
04:29:25.250 --> 04:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
04:29:28.010 --> 04:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
um so I think try to summarize as best I
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
can where we stand
 
04:29:32.510 --> 04:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
um based on our understanding which is
 
04:29:35.450 --> 04:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
our feeling is that an amendment is not
 
04:29:35.460 --> 04:29:37.130 align:start position:0%
our feeling is that an amendment is not
necessary

04:29:37.130 --> 04:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:29:38.990 --> 04:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
um but we were asked to assist
 
04:29:41.689 --> 04:29:41.699 align:start position:0%
representative Baxter with
 
04:29:44.210 --> 04:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
um the creation of an amendment and we
 
04:29:47.510 --> 04:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
believe that this amendment is safer at
 
04:29:53.929 --> 04:29:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay it's your question
 
04:30:00.649 --> 04:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
so you would have no problem with the
 
04:30:09.410 --> 04:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:09.420 --> 04:30:10.729 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:30:10.729 --> 04:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:14.570 --> 04:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
I would say that that that's an accurate
 
04:30:17.030 --> 04:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
statement we'd have no problem
 
04:30:19.790 --> 04:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
um with this bill being amended I
 
04:30:22.070 --> 04:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
believe during the last work session
 
04:30:24.590 --> 04:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative Ames had asked the
 
04:30:27.769 --> 04:30:27.779 align:start position:0%
specific question whether this has the
 
04:30:30.590 --> 04:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
potential to cause confusion and my
 
04:30:32.330 --> 04:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
answer to that question was I think any
 
04:30:36.290 --> 04:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
time that you add a really specific
 
04:30:40.010 --> 04:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
language carving out a particular
 
04:30:41.950 --> 04:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
um industry
 
04:30:44.269 --> 04:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
that there's the potential to cause
 
04:30:44.279 --> 04:30:45.710 align:start position:0%
that there's the potential to cause
confusion

04:30:45.710 --> 04:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
04:30:45.720 --> 04:30:46.370 align:start position:0%
confusion
um

04:30:46.370 --> 04:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:46.380 --> 04:30:47.870 align:start position:0%
um
but

04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:30:50.269 --> 04:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
I'm relatively comfortable with this as
 
04:30:50.279 --> 04:30:51.290 align:start position:0%
I'm relatively comfortable with this as
drafted

04:30:51.290 --> 04:30:51.300 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
04:30:54.649 --> 04:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
yeah and the whole idea of the amount is
 
04:30:58.490 --> 04:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
is that we needed to clarify to make
 
04:31:01.849 --> 04:31:01.859 align:start position:0%
sure that travel agents were just doing
 
04:31:04.429 --> 04:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
their business as travel agents weren't
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
being taxed
 
04:31:10.490 --> 04:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh representative herzl Nunez
 
04:31:13.010 --> 04:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:31:16.610 --> 04:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
um I I like the amendment because I just
 
04:31:17.870 --> 04:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
want to remind
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
um everybody and maybe uh you guys can
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
keep me honest
 
04:31:24.170 --> 04:31:24.180 align:start position:0%
um we've talked about this uh this bill
 
04:31:26.269 --> 04:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
several times now we've had a couple of
 
04:31:28.250 --> 04:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
work sessions we've heard hearings we've
 
04:31:30.170 --> 04:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
heard testimony
 
04:31:32.450 --> 04:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
um and and it all came down to the fact
 
04:31:34.610 --> 04:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
that we had questions about the travel
 
04:31:37.969 --> 04:31:37.979 align:start position:0%
agents and that's why uh we went for
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
having an amendment to begin with is
 
04:31:42.170 --> 04:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
because there was a question about the
 
04:31:44.510 --> 04:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
travel agents and then in testimony from
 
04:31:48.050 --> 04:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
the dra there was there was uh there was
 
04:31:49.809 --> 04:31:49.819 align:start position:0%
conversation about
 
04:31:52.610 --> 04:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
confusion with the rules committee
 
04:31:55.790 --> 04:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
and that is where I think uh confusion
 
04:31:58.910 --> 04:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
sets in for a lot of people uh if I if I
 
04:32:00.530 --> 04:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
remember correctly
 
04:32:02.450 --> 04:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
um our representative from the dra
 
04:32:04.490 --> 04:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
didn't know whether or not the rules
 
04:32:06.290 --> 04:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
committee was going to have an issue
 
04:32:08.689 --> 04:32:08.699 align:start position:0%
with the original bill that's why we
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
went for an amendment and the First
 
04:32:12.649 --> 04:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
Amendment wasn't acceptable so we worked
 
04:32:14.210 --> 04:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
on the Second Amendment and this
 
04:32:16.849 --> 04:32:16.859 align:start position:0%
amendment clearly states I think what
 
04:32:20.269 --> 04:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
the rules committee will need in order
 
04:32:23.450 --> 04:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
to make their rule around this statute
 
04:32:27.410 --> 04:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
and if the if the um I I don't remember
 
04:32:28.969 --> 04:32:28.979 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:32:30.649 --> 04:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
the representative's name that's with us
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
today because I can't see the whole
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
screen right now so I apologize ma'am uh
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
can can will you just clarify that
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
that's the process that we went through
 
04:32:40.969 --> 04:32:40.979 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure that it was the
 
04:32:43.790 --> 04:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
charge that was being talked about and
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
not the travel agent as whole business
 
04:32:48.649 --> 04:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
per se and that's why we wanted this
 
04:32:48.659 --> 04:32:50.990 align:start position:0%
per se and that's why we wanted this
amendment

04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
um I would just clarify representative
 
04:32:55.910 --> 04:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question my comments
 
04:32:58.490 --> 04:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
about being concerned with the outcome
 
04:33:01.550 --> 04:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
before the rules committee were specific
 
04:33:04.730 --> 04:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
to the first amendment that
 
04:33:08.449 --> 04:33:08.459 align:start position:0%
representative Baxter had drafted
 
04:33:10.970 --> 04:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
um my concern was that
 
04:33:14.570 --> 04:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
jailcar could interpret that language as
 
04:33:18.109 --> 04:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
being broader than what was intended and
 
04:33:20.929 --> 04:33:20.939 align:start position:0%
that therefore our attempts to enact
 
04:33:20.939 --> 04:33:22.609 align:start position:0%
that therefore our attempts to enact
rules

04:33:22.609 --> 04:33:22.619 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:33:25.849 --> 04:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
um construing it narrowly
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
um would be seen by jailcar as not being
 
04:33:31.730 --> 04:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
consistent with that Amendment we do not
 
04:33:34.010 --> 04:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
have any concerns about our ability to
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
effectively enact rules under the bill
 
04:33:40.609 --> 04:33:40.619 align:start position:0%
as drafted it was very specific to the
 
04:33:43.789 --> 04:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
language in that first amendment
 
04:33:46.869 --> 04:33:46.879 align:start position:0%
may I follow up Mr chairman
 
04:33:51.051 --> 04:33:51.061 align:start position:0%
uh thank you ma'am um so again I'm
 
04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
confused uh because uh I believe that we
 
04:33:57.051 --> 04:33:57.061 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we defined down
 
04:33:59.929 --> 04:33:59.939 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the travel agencies
 
04:34:01.730 --> 04:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
weren't being charged something they
 
04:34:03.769 --> 04:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be charged
 
04:34:07.490 --> 04:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
um and does this amendment not clarify
 
04:34:07.500 --> 04:34:12.349 align:start position:0%
um and does this amendment not clarify
that

04:34:12.349 --> 04:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:14.510 --> 04:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
no I believe the amendment certainly
 
04:34:16.369 --> 04:34:16.379 align:start position:0%
clarifies that
 
04:34:18.410 --> 04:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not sure that this is an issue
 
04:34:22.010 --> 04:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
that requires clarification
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
um but certainly don't get a vote in
 
04:34:26.990 --> 04:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
that um that question
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
um I think that we could um
 
04:34:32.029 --> 04:34:32.039 align:start position:0%
adequately answer the question relative
 
04:34:34.310 --> 04:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
to travel agents based on how the bill
 
04:34:37.131 --> 04:34:37.141 align:start position:0%
is currently drafted
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you look Tim Baxter representative
 
04:34:41.279 --> 04:34:43.189 align:start position:0%
thank you look Tim Baxter representative
Baxter

04:34:43.189 --> 04:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
Baxter
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
04:34:46.670 --> 04:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
04:34:48.230 --> 04:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
um that discussion that was just going
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
on and we've got a bill that's pretty
 
04:34:54.410 --> 04:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
popular overall in terms of the intent
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
as written and the only hang up that
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
I've heard
 
04:35:00.650 --> 04:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
um from interest groups and stakeholders
 
04:35:02.810 --> 04:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
and people in my community is this
 
04:35:05.869 --> 04:35:05.879 align:start position:0%
potential issue of travel agents travel
 
04:35:09.051 --> 04:35:09.061 align:start position:0%
agent Services being taxed and while I
 
04:35:11.390 --> 04:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
respect the dra's perspective that the
 
04:35:13.849 --> 04:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
amendment isn't needed not all interest
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
groups and stakeholders agree with that
 
04:35:20.090 --> 04:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
view which is why I felt strongly about
 
04:35:22.849 --> 04:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
proposing an amendment this current
 
04:35:26.449 --> 04:35:26.459 align:start position:0%
amendment is written by dra and I've
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
worked with them to make sure we have an
 
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that's suitable but with the
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
amendment that's going to alleviate the
 
04:35:35.390 --> 04:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
only concern major concern that's
 
04:35:37.910 --> 04:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
lingering for some interest groups and
 
04:35:39.529 --> 04:35:39.539 align:start position:0%
stakeholders as well as some fellow
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
members on the committee and I think
 
04:35:44.390 --> 04:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
with this amendment that the has written
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
and had that she's she's just spoke to
 
04:35:48.890 --> 04:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
that she's relatively comfortable with
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
she did write the amendment
 
04:35:53.330 --> 04:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
um I think it would it would be able to
 
04:35:54.529 --> 04:35:54.539 align:start position:0%
be exact
 
04:35:58.010 --> 04:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
um very easily with this amendment so
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
um you know I I don't I don't really see
 
04:36:03.470 --> 04:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
the harm my perspective is we should do
 
04:36:05.449 --> 04:36:05.459 align:start position:0%
it once and we should do it right thank
 
04:36:06.590 --> 04:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
04:36:09.410 --> 04:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
well thank you represent Baxter
 
04:36:12.289 --> 04:36:12.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.051 --> 04:36:15.061 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman there is a lot
 
04:36:17.949 --> 04:36:17.959 align:start position:0%
cleaner way to do this but it it
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
depends on uh the members uh
 
04:36:24.949 --> 04:36:24.959 align:start position:0%
understanding of how jail car works and
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
how the legal process works and that
 
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
would be to put into the blurb the
 
04:36:35.510 --> 04:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
majority blurb on that the intent of
 
04:36:39.189 --> 04:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is on
 
04:36:41.650 --> 04:36:41.660 align:start position:0%
not to tax
 
04:36:47.810 --> 04:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:51.109 --> 04:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
and that would be read by jail Carr
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
and on would be respected by the dra if
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
it wasn't respected by the dra it would
 
04:36:59.510 --> 04:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
be read by jail Carr and they would
 
04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
would insist
 
04:37:03.650 --> 04:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
on so
 
04:37:06.709 --> 04:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
um it would avoid having to put into
 
04:37:09.890 --> 04:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
statute of specific occupation after
 
04:37:12.590 --> 04:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
which other occupations might try to say
 
04:37:15.170 --> 04:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
well maybe maybe I would get involved
 
04:37:15.180 --> 04:37:16.730 align:start position:0%
well maybe maybe I would get involved
too

04:37:16.730 --> 04:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:37:20.810 --> 04:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
um so uh it is an alternative way to do
 
04:37:22.970 --> 04:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
this which I hope the majority will
 
04:37:27.769 --> 04:37:27.779 align:start position:0%
consider when you go to caucus thank you
 
04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative news
 
04:37:31.609 --> 04:37:31.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and to uh
 
04:37:33.410 --> 04:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
representative Almy I believe the
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
amendment takes that out of occupation
 
04:37:38.750 --> 04:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
and puts it down to the charge not to
 
04:37:40.250 --> 04:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
the occupation that's what the
 
04:37:49.810 --> 04:37:49.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:56.230 --> 04:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:00.529 --> 04:38:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:00.539 --> 04:38:01.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:38:01.189 --> 04:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:03.289 --> 04:38:03.299 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where where things were
 
04:38:04.970 --> 04:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
left in terms of sending out that
 
04:38:08.510 --> 04:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment but it seems to to all of us
 
04:38:10.990 --> 04:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
so that we can have it when we're
 
04:38:14.269 --> 04:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
deliberating in caucus
 
04:38:19.250 --> 04:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:22.789 --> 04:38:22.799 align:start position:0%
and I took a screenshot
 
04:38:27.051 --> 04:38:27.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:30.410 --> 04:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:30.420 --> 04:38:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
Tim

04:38:35.150 --> 04:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:38.209 --> 04:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
would you make sure it gets out to the
 
04:38:40.131 --> 04:38:40.141 align:start position:0%
Full House
 
04:38:43.970 --> 04:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:46.189 --> 04:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
all right any further discussion on this
 
04:38:49.131 --> 04:38:49.141 align:start position:0%
this is looks like it's the only Hangout
 
04:38:52.869 --> 04:38:52.879 align:start position:0%
on passage of Hell House bill
 
04:38:52.879 --> 04:38:54.470 align:start position:0%
on passage of Hell House bill
15.

04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
15.
 
04:39:00.730 --> 04:39:00.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:03.650 --> 04:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
either one
 
04:39:05.990 --> 04:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Hamburg
 
04:39:08.810 --> 04:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I do have a question
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh what does the Wayfair decision
 
04:39:15.890 --> 04:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
enter into this when the facilitator is
 
04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
not located within the state but is in
 
04:39:19.369 --> 04:39:19.379 align:start position:0%
another state
 
04:39:19.379 --> 04:39:20.869 align:start position:0%
another state
and

04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:23.029 --> 04:39:23.039 align:start position:0%
will the dra be going after that
 
04:39:25.730 --> 04:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
facilitator to pay the tax
 
04:39:25.740 --> 04:39:27.890 align:start position:0%
facilitator to pay the tax
uh

04:39:27.890 --> 04:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:39:30.410 --> 04:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of arguments when we were
 
04:39:33.529 --> 04:39:33.539 align:start position:0%
discussing Wayfarer South Dakota could
 
04:39:36.769 --> 04:39:36.779 align:start position:0%
come here and request our our companies
 
04:39:39.650 --> 04:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:42.050 --> 04:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
how does the Wayfarer decision play with
 
04:39:43.970 --> 04:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
facilitators that are not located in the
 
04:39:45.230 --> 04:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
state in New Hampshire is going to go
 
04:39:48.350 --> 04:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
out and try and get the meals and rooms
 
04:39:48.360 --> 04:39:50.650 align:start position:0%
out and try and get the meals and rooms
money

04:39:50.650 --> 04:39:50.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:50.660 --> 04:39:52.190 align:start position:0%
 
Caroline

04:39:52.190 --> 04:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
Caroline
 
04:39:55.490 --> 04:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
could you respond to that
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
um so certainly the Wayfair decision
 
04:39:58.440 --> 04:39:59.448 align:start position:0%
um so certainly the Wayfair decision
um

04:39:59.448 --> 04:39:59.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:03.470 --> 04:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
does come into play here in that you do
 
04:40:06.890 --> 04:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
have remote sellers
 
04:40:10.190 --> 04:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
um located in another state
 
04:40:12.110 --> 04:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
um renting property here in New
 
04:40:12.120 --> 04:40:13.670 align:start position:0%
um renting property here in New
Hampshire

04:40:13.670 --> 04:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:40:15.830 --> 04:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
um in that sense I think the Wayfair
 
04:40:17.750 --> 04:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
decision is
 
04:40:17.760 --> 04:40:18.410 align:start position:0%
decision is
um

04:40:18.410 --> 04:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
helpful but not strictly necessary
 
04:40:24.410 --> 04:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
because I think the difference between
 
04:40:28.430 --> 04:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
normal sales is um in this instance
 
04:40:31.310 --> 04:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
I think we would assert that the remote
 
04:40:34.130 --> 04:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
sellers do have adequate contacts here
 
04:40:36.170 --> 04:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because they're
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
controlling the rental of property
 
04:40:41.930 --> 04:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
located here in New Hampshire
 
04:40:43.130 --> 04:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that we would really
 
04:40:45.890 --> 04:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
need to rely on the Wayfair decision to
 
04:40:45.900 --> 04:40:46.970 align:start position:0%
need to rely on the Wayfair decision to
adequately

04:40:46.970 --> 04:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
adequately
 
04:40:50.510 --> 04:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
um audit and uh Sports compliance for
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
those remote sellers
 
04:40:55.448 --> 04:40:55.458 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:40:58.910 --> 04:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
any further discussion yeah I just had a
 
04:41:00.970 --> 04:41:00.980 align:start position:0%
quick comment um
 
04:41:05.090 --> 04:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you I wanted to pick up on I think
 
04:41:08.390 --> 04:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
it was your chair chairman Majors uh
 
04:41:11.030 --> 04:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
comment that this basically a good bill
 
04:41:11.040 --> 04:41:11.868 align:start position:0%
comment that this basically a good bill
that

04:41:11.868 --> 04:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:14.770 --> 04:41:14.780 align:start position:0%
most if not all of us
 
04:41:18.650 --> 04:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
agree with and that's great and I think
 
04:41:21.288 --> 04:41:21.298 align:start position:0%
in looking at this question of language
 
04:41:25.010 --> 04:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
and travel agents and
 
04:41:28.430 --> 04:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
um other stuff that surrounds that we're
 
04:41:30.948 --> 04:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
just all trying to get to a point
 
04:41:33.430 --> 04:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:41:37.990 --> 04:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
that clarifies and perfects this bill
 
04:41:42.410 --> 04:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
and in looking at the language that uh
 
04:41:44.770 --> 04:41:44.780 align:start position:0%
has been developed the first time around
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
my my initial reaction was that created
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
potential confusion or
 
04:41:58.670 --> 04:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
um or gaming gaming of the system and
 
04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to look at it again and I
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
hope we all do my status at this moment
 
04:42:08.448 --> 04:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
is that we're better off with the
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
without the amendment but I will look at
 
04:42:12.120 --> 04:42:14.090 align:start position:0%
without the amendment but I will look at
it

04:42:14.090 --> 04:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:42:17.090 --> 04:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions or
 
04:42:17.100 --> 04:42:18.230 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions or
comments

04:42:18.230 --> 04:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
comments
 
04:42:22.670 --> 04:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
on Hospital 15 as the men with the
 
04:42:22.680 --> 04:42:25.610 align:start position:0%
on Hospital 15 as the men with the
amendment

04:42:25.610 --> 04:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:25.620 --> 04:42:34.368 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:42:34.368 --> 04:42:34.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:37.250 --> 04:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
I will send a link out to the house
 
04:42:40.010 --> 04:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
Republican members for a caucus this
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:44.570 --> 04:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
can we say
 
04:42:47.330 --> 04:42:47.340 align:start position:0%

04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
anybody got a problem or should we go
 
04:42:56.390 --> 04:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
what was the number 230
 
04:42:58.788 --> 04:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
2 30. yeah
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%

all right Mr chairman yes representative
 
04:43:08.690 --> 04:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
I'd like the Democrats to assemble I
 
04:43:10.310 --> 04:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
presume we still have a working link
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
from representative gorg on
 
04:43:16.850 --> 04:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
say 10 minutes after we close this so
 
04:43:19.730 --> 04:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
that we can not interfere in the middle
 
04:43:22.368 --> 04:43:22.378 align:start position:0%
of the rest of our afternoon
 
04:43:30.368 --> 04:43:30.378 align:start position:0%

04:43:52.128 --> 04:43:52.138 align:start position:0%
of things we have to look at
 
04:43:54.830 --> 04:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
the information of
 
04:43:57.890 --> 04:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor ratio
 
04:44:00.170 --> 04:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
so we also want to look at all the
 
04:44:05.090 --> 04:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:09.708 --> 04:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
and and anything else to do with the
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
revenue implications
 
04:44:14.330 --> 04:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
can I uh can I chime in on that
 
04:44:17.810 --> 04:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
satisfactor thing yes
 
04:44:21.708 --> 04:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
so we we passed House Bill 281 out of
 
04:44:24.650 --> 04:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
out of ways it means 22 to nothing which
 
04:44:26.330 --> 04:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
extends the date out
 
04:44:30.948 --> 04:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
to 2026 from 2022.
 
04:44:33.948 --> 04:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
the finance committee is now looking at
 
04:44:33.958 --> 04:44:34.850 align:start position:0%
the finance committee is now looking at
that

04:44:34.850 --> 04:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
and asking us
 
04:44:41.570 --> 04:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
if they put this into house bill 2.
 
04:44:45.410 --> 04:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill 281 into house bill 2.
 
04:44:48.948 --> 04:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
that uh they're asking what do we think
 
04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
the impact would be on our Revenue
 
04:44:52.810 --> 04:44:52.820 align:start position:0%
estimates for
 
04:44:56.510 --> 04:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
2023. right I sent that to all members
 
04:44:57.890 --> 04:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
of the House of rising Means Committee
 
04:44:59.030 --> 04:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay but I just want to make sure
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
everybody understands and hopefully
 
04:45:02.448 --> 04:45:02.458 align:start position:0%
everybody thinks about that
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
um I know I personally
 
04:45:07.550 --> 04:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh reduce my estimates
 
04:45:11.868 --> 04:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
when I when I did mine uh because of of
 
04:45:13.850 --> 04:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
uh of uh
 
04:45:17.390 --> 04:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh a single sales Factor
 
04:45:19.070 --> 04:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
but if there's not going to be single
 
04:45:20.330 --> 04:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
sales Factor
 
04:45:22.128 --> 04:45:22.138 align:start position:0%
meaning nothing is going to change from
 
04:45:24.410 --> 04:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
existing other than market-based
 
04:45:26.470 --> 04:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
sourcing which is in place this year
 
04:45:29.750 --> 04:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
does that change people's thinking about
 
04:45:32.930 --> 04:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
about 23 fiscal 23 for a single sales
 
04:45:34.310 --> 04:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
factor that that's that's what we're
 
04:45:35.750 --> 04:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to talk about tomorrow one of the
 
04:45:39.890 --> 04:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:42.170 --> 04:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
and we need to come up with something
 
04:45:45.650 --> 04:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
further to help finance committee out on
 
04:45:45.660 --> 04:45:48.288 align:start position:0%
further to help finance committee out on
this

04:45:48.288 --> 04:45:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
all right anything else I want to bring
 
04:45:53.690 --> 04:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
up before we terminate this
 
04:45:57.890 --> 04:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
then uh so what time is it now
 
04:46:00.350 --> 04:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
I think we'll stick with 2 30 for the
 
04:46:02.208 --> 04:46:02.218 align:start position:0%
Republicans to meet
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
