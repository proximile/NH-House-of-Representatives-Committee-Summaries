00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
so the members will notice that uh we
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
have an amendment today that was passed
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
out when we get to
 
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.069 align:start position:0%
out when we get to
624

00:09:19.069 --> 00:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
624
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
FNA um so I draw that to your attention
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
before we get to that and
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
um we're going to just so that everybody
 
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
knows before we actually call the dam
 
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.470 align:start position:0%
knows before we actually call the dam
Bill

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
629 for a vote we're going to take a
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
break uh everyone has agreed the
 
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
leadership has agreed we're going to
 
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
have a caucus break uh because of an
 
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that was submitted and some
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
other issues that have risen regarding
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
the dam Bill very important bill so
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be a short break maybe five
 
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
minutes uh 10 minutes uh before we get
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
to 6:29 then we'll reconvene and go back
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
to to 629 and the rest of the bills and
 
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
we will have a caucus after uh in the
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
afternoon after we hear 691 FN for the
 
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
three bills this afternoon and the last
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
I looked on the website will this will
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
complete our 21
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
bills so and we may I'm told by the
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
speaker we might get some bills coming
 
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
over early from the Senate that may come
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
to us but as of right now we should be
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
all set until March after today and
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
again remember
 
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
um now we're going to have to write
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
reports for all these so again those
 
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
that are writing the reports will be the
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
maker of the motion and all the Democrat
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
motions and makers that you send your
 
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
report to representative NAB and the
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
Republicans send them to me then I
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
accumulate them together I send them off
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
to our staff and then it gets placed on
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
the calendar you have to watch the
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
calendar because there'll be a lot of
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
bills coming in and I'm told we're going
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
to have session probably three four
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
times before we get to March uh except
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
for that February vacation so I don't
 
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
know when the bills were exacting today
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
will be on they could be on the
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
following week they could be on two
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
weeks they could be three weeks so you
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
you just have to read and read the the
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh calendar uh so then you'll know when
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
we'll be up on the floor uh we have a
 
00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
number of bills on the floor tomorrow so
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping everybody can be here for
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
that appreciate it uh so now I'm going
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
to call the hearing on HB
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
568 allowing subdivision regulations
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
concerning water supply the exec on this
 
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
and I believe uh representative donelly
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
you have a motion thank you Mr chair I'd
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion of itl for
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
568 so we have a motion and do we have a
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
second second Mr
 
00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:02.839 align:start position:0%
chair representative Bridal seconded the
 
00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
maker would you like to speak to your
 
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.160 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair um so we heard
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh lots of testimony for House Bill uh
 
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
568 and some of the key notes that were
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
taken um is how this particular Bill uh
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
would really incur quite a bit of cost
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh for doing studies that can be
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
extremely costly and uh the towns
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
themselves have uh the you know the
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over you know some of the
 
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
studies need to be done so we don't need
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
this overreaching bill in addition Dees
 
00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
uh indicated that this was not a WID
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
widespread issue um so Wells that will
 
00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
be drilled and and people will have you
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
know issues they will definitely be able
 
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
to work with the towns and work with the
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
community um to help you know identify
 
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
this and this should be very specific to
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
each community and how they need to do
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%

about um about uh personal
 
00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility um you know they it would
 
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
be easy to amend this bill to remove the
 
00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:51.319 align:start position:0%
requirement for wearing a life
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
jacket um just uh a couple of comments
 
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
on some of the testimony that was
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
received um during the hearing that um
 
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
being the um sponsor of the bill I
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't comment on one was that um
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
there was a comment that um there was
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
already uh language in place for um
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
careless and Reckless um uh that was
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
passed last year for careless and
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
Reckless watercraft Behavior while
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
that's true the bill last year actually
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
reduced um the uh that penalty from a um
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor to a um uh to a violation
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
this um uh puts in place um makes it a
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
viol uh misdemeanor again as is with ski
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
craft and there's also a comment about
 
00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:40.519 align:start position:0%
there's no place to store um uh um pfcs
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
on a ski Craft on a jet ski all um
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
three-person ski crafts or a large
 
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
number of large person ski crafts have
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
actually storage compartments so that's
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
inaccurate as well so um all in all um I
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
I I believe that um New Hampshire should
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
take um uh
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
should take safety precautions for um
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
especially for uh you know younger
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
members of uh of our um of our
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
population and our visitors and uh
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill would have done so
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
I urge the uh the committee to oppose
 
00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:21.559 align:start position:0%

really important bill that addresses a
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
huge issue in the state with flooding
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
both in coastal regions and in state and
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
um but we heard in in testimony it's a
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
really complicated issue the bill has a
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
lot of pieces so we think it needss a

little bit more work and a little more
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
time for the committee to tease apart

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
policy recognized that the Hampton Beach
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
and the area commission that was um
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
created via Statute in 2003 um really
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
helps identify Hampton Beach uh as an
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
economic driver for this state and I
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
think um passing the funding of this
 
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
bill is good policy and um one of the
 
00:21:40.269 --> 00:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
concerns that was brought up was the
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
financial issue and I know there's a
 
00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
financial component to this and we we
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to pass that on to them but as
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
far as the policy goes we think this is
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
good policy so thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
um I agree um that Hampton Beach is
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
important for the state it's also
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
important for Hampton Beach including
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
the um uh the businesses of Hampton
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
Beach um I don't believe that the state
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
should bear the entire cost of
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
maintaining funds uh to run this
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
commission um I think it's while I think
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
it's fair for the state to provide some
 
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
there are already um there's already a
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
statute in place that allows the
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
commission to receive gifts um and other
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
um other funds to support themselves so
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
I um I won't be supporting this um as
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
written um I think that there should be
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
some um some recognition that other
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
funds need to be um coming from local
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
sources as
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%

Lo the local River Management advisory

groups um I think that um this bill
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
should have um provided an option to
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
receive funds from other sources
 
00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039 align:start position:0%
including um uh gifts um and any uh any
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
sources that come from that can be um
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
that can come from federal grants and
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
things like that um I'm going to vote
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
consider fixing this in the future to
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
allow for a wider uh input of funding so
 
00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't have to keep paying
 
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:36.870 align:start position:0%

on HB 663 allowing the division of
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
historic resources to expend moose plate
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
funds to administer and fund Grant have
 
01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.830 --> 01:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
going to present the
 
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
bill um good morning Mr chair and
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:22:09.149 --> 01:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
my name is Karen Eble I represent um
 
01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
marac district 7 which is New London and
 
01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
Newbury um and I'm here to introduce
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
663 um just to be clear I'm introducing
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
the bill at the request of the division
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
of historic resources so it's an agency
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
request um and the director of um Human
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
Resources Benjamin Wilson is here with
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
me today so if we need more details on
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
the bill um I think he'll be able to to
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
fill us in so basically um the the
 
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
division of historic resources along
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
with several other groups have Grant
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
programs that they utilize moose plate
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
money for and in this case we were just
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
talking over here historical resources
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
has a grant program that has been in
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
existence for 25 years so there's really
 
01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
nothing new in in this bill the language
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
that you have in the bill that's in bold
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
is clarifying language to show that um
 
01:23:23.679 --> 01:23:24.950 align:start position:0%
is clarifying language to show that um
historic

01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
historic
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
sources in addition to purely using
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
moose plate money say to replace
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
shingles on a historic building can also
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
be used for the administration of the of
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
the program and obviously funding of the
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
grants so it's clarifying language um
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
and as he can tell you more about this
 
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
uh is confirmed by the attorney general
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
that this is an appropriate reading of
 
01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
the statute as it stands now but it's
 
01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:01.639 align:start position:0%
helpful uh for historic resources to um
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
have that confirmed in statutory
 
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
language so that's that's the upshot of
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
the bill I will say that I uh personally
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
as a member of finance division one that
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
res reviews dncr budgets and and men and
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
the budgets of many other agencies were
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
really really sensitive to the
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
diminished Revenue situ ation that they
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
all find themselves in and um I
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
certainly support anything that any of
 
01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
those agencies can do to clarify in
 
01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
statute um uh language that permits them
 
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
to use the full breath of the
 
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity provided to them by the
 
01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:48.280 align:start position:0%
Moose plate money and anything else they
 
01:24:52.109 --> 01:24:52.119 align:start position:0%
can get so um I'm also a member of the
 
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
of the elip board I'm not here in that
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
capacity either but um you know these
 
01:24:59.950 --> 01:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
agencies really appreciate and depend on
 
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
moose plate money so with that um if you
 
01:25:06.109 --> 01:25:06.119 align:start position:0%
have any questions I'll conclude my any
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
Taylor thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
for taking the question was there any
 
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
consideration to make the monies also
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
available for state Register of
 
01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.550 align:start position:0%
available for state Register of
historical

01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
historical
 
01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.350 align:start position:0%
historical
sites

01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
sites
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
um well I'm going to ask ask uh do you
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
do you use it for State sites no there's
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
no there's been no discussion about that
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
I mean just representative just to
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
follow up on it this is a very
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
longstanding statute that's um you know
 
01:25:42.189 --> 01:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
if we uh mess with it too much I think
 
01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very complicating but
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know certainly anyway yep anyone
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
else seeing none thank you appreciate it
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%

663 this proposed language addition to

the New Hampshire Conservation and
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
Heritage license plate program commonly
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
referred to as the Moose plate program
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
RSA 261 colon 97-
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
c1a was the result of asking the
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office if DHR could
 
01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
legally use a portion of its annual
 
01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
moose plate appropriation to recover
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
administrative costs associated with the
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
program the answer was yes and I've
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
included as I mentioned that opinion uh
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
in your
 
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
packet we further asked uh if it would
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
be reasonable or helpful to add the
 
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
proposed language in HB 663 clarifying
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
and making the language more transparent
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
regarding the funds uh uses as they
 
01:27:57.070 --> 01:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
apply to the DHR and again the answer
 
01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.270 align:start position:0%
apply to the DHR and again the answer
was

01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes based on proposed budget cuts uh
 
01:28:03.229 --> 01:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
alluded to Again by the representative
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the next banum we want to be certain
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
that we'll be able to operate our moose
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
plate grant program which may require
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
the DHR DHR using a portion of its
 
01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
annual moose plate appropriation to
 
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
cover a portion of the program manager's
 
01:28:20.109 --> 01:28:20.119 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits currently that
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
position uses Approximately 80% of its
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
time managing the moose PL grant program
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
which equates to
 
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
$11,932 of that position's current total
 
01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
salary and
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
benefits um the DHR annually receives a
 
01:28:40.030 --> 01:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
moose plate appropriation uh of between
 
01:28:42.109 --> 01:28:42.119 align:start position:0%
$250 and
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
$300,000 uh which is then granted out to
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities for the restoration of
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%

blue sheets and the
 
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
online so online we have nine in favor
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
five opposed but two of those five
 
01:31:17.709 --> 01:31:17.719 align:start position:0%

Mike good afternoon welcome to resources
 
02:57:06.229 --> 02:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
Recreation and development I'm going to
 
02:57:09.830 --> 02:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on HB 683 FN relative
 
02:57:13.950 --> 02:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
to off Highway recreational vehicles as
 
02:57:16.070 --> 02:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
you can see I have quite a few of these
 
02:57:17.710 --> 02:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
pink cards with people that would like
 
02:57:20.590 --> 02:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
to speak and we always love to hear from
 
02:57:22.910 --> 02:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
everybody that wants to speak but I'd
 
02:57:24.990 --> 02:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
just ask you if somebody before you or
 
02:57:26.990 --> 02:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
the 10 people before you said the same
 
02:57:28.950 --> 02:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
thing it would be helpful if you'd give
 
02:57:30.950 --> 02:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
us your name and address and who do you
 
02:57:33.710 --> 02:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
represent and how do you feel uh you
 
02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't need to repeat what everybody else
 
02:57:38.070 --> 02:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
said but I want you to be able to come
 
02:57:39.910 --> 02:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
forward and let us know you're here and
 
02:57:42.429 --> 02:57:42.439 align:start position:0%
how you feel I have one card in here
 
02:57:44.469 --> 02:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted 10 minutes I would hope
 
02:57:47.030 --> 02:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
that that was a slight exaggeration that
 
02:57:49.389 --> 02:57:49.399 align:start position:0%
maybe they could take a little less that
 
02:57:50.990 --> 02:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
would be nice but we don't want to cut
 
02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
you off so I'm going to start with the
 
02:57:56.110 --> 02:57:56.120 align:start position:0%

organization uh that represents the
 
02:58:53.070 --> 02:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
aters in the state we'll talk about
 
02:58:55.710 --> 02:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
part now just to make it clear what
 
02:58:58.510 --> 02:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today is a process
 
02:59:00.110 --> 02:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about opening roads
 
02:59:02.229 --> 02:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about whether ATVs are
 
02:59:03.790 --> 02:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
good whether they're bad this is a
 
02:59:06.510 --> 02:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
process and this is a process that was
 
02:59:09.190 --> 02:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh has been developed over the last 10
 
02:59:11.510 --> 02:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
years and has worked very well in Coos
 
02:59:13.750 --> 02:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
and grafting
 
02:59:18.429 --> 02:59:18.439 align:start position:0%
counties as you know uh as we the uh
 
02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
sport has grown you need trails and
 
02:59:23.590 --> 02:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes to get to one section Trail to
 
02:59:25.950 --> 02:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
another section Trail if you don't have
 
02:59:28.269 --> 02:59:28.279 align:start position:0%
a Cooperative land owner you need a
 
02:59:31.670 --> 02:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
piece of road to connect them uh and
 
02:59:33.190 --> 02:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's either a Town Road could be class
 
02:59:36.429 --> 02:59:36.439 align:start position:0%
six could be class five four and some
 
02:59:38.550 --> 02:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
occasionally you need help from the
 
02:59:40.710 --> 02:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to connect to
 
02:59:44.990 --> 02:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
Trails so what we found to be the right
 
02:59:47.510 --> 02:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
process and keep everything transparent
 
02:59:47.520 --> 02:59:49.110 align:start position:0%
process and keep everything transparent
was

02:59:49.110 --> 02:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:59:51.349 --> 02:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
the club will come to the town say we
 
02:59:53.349 --> 02:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
need the Section Road to connect our
 
02:59:55.710 --> 02:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
Trails they'll meet with a selectman the
 
02:59:57.950 --> 02:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
selectman will look it over talk with
 
02:59:59.349 --> 02:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
the public works department talk with
 
03:00:00.870 --> 03:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
the police department and if they think
 
03:00:03.630 --> 03:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
it can work the next thing they do is
 
03:00:06.110 --> 03:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
notify all the abutters and schedule a
 
03:00:06.120 --> 03:00:07.950 align:start position:0%
notify all the abutters and schedule a
public

03:00:07.950 --> 03:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:00:11.469 --> 03:00:11.479 align:start position:0%
hearing then the public is notified
 
03:00:15.229 --> 03:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
through newspaper ads online and uh
 
03:00:18.070 --> 03:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
through um mail to all the butters and
 
03:00:19.950 --> 03:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
then there's a public hearing then the
 
03:00:22.070 --> 03:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
Selectmen make the decision whether they
 
03:00:24.150 --> 03:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
want to open it or
 
03:00:27.150 --> 03:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
not now when we add the part in there
 
03:00:29.870 --> 03:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:00:33.429 --> 03:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
um state roads it's the same process it
 
03:00:36.110 --> 03:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
goes from the club to the selectman
 
03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:37.269 align:start position:0%
goes from the club to the selectman
public

03:00:37.269 --> 03:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:00:40.510 --> 03:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
hearing butter is noticed then if
 
03:00:41.830 --> 03:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
everything passes and the selectman are
 
03:00:46.269 --> 03:00:46.279 align:start position:0%
happy then the do is approached and the
 
03:00:49.229 --> 03:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
do uh using a Ros course is always a
 
03:00:52.910 --> 03:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
final say so it's very transparent so
 
03:00:54.750 --> 03:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
that everybody involved with the club
 
03:00:56.630 --> 03:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
the town the abuts all know what's going
 
03:00:59.269 --> 03:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
on everything's above
 
03:01:03.349 --> 03:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
board and so when there's a problem the
 
03:01:06.469 --> 03:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
town always has the ability to reverse
 
03:01:08.550 --> 03:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
this decision at any
 
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
time uh the only way that um Trails work
 
03:01:14.630 --> 03:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
are with Cooperative land owners so if
 
03:01:18.110 --> 03:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
the town uh is seeing problems with law
 
03:01:21.590 --> 03:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement or uh traffic or or problems
 
03:01:23.910 --> 03:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
in the roads or deterioration they
 
03:01:26.389 --> 03:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
always have the ability to cancel the
 
03:01:28.750 --> 03:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
agreement and close it at any
 
03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:30.750 align:start position:0%
agreement and close it at any
time

03:01:30.750 --> 03:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:01:33.670 --> 03:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
um that's the way it has worked in Coos
 
03:01:35.110 --> 03:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
and grafting County and and been very
 
03:01:36.910 --> 03:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
successful and and again being very
 
03:01:38.670 --> 03:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
transparent this part of the bill is
 
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
just expanding it to other counties so
 
03:01:43.229 --> 03:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
that they have the ability and and this
 
03:01:46.309 --> 03:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
process is in RSA so that it's just
 
03:01:48.429 --> 03:01:48.439 align:start position:0%
adding it to other counties to be able
 
03:01:50.990 --> 03:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
to have the same process if they want to
 
03:01:52.830 --> 03:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
nobody says they have to nobody says
 
03:01:55.750 --> 03:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
they they should shouldn't doesn't
 
03:01:58.469 --> 03:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
matter but it it avails a process to
 
03:02:00.269 --> 03:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
them if they'd like
 
03:02:03.070 --> 03:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
to so again this really has nothing to
 
03:02:05.950 --> 03:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
do with um whether you like ATVs or not
 
03:02:07.590 --> 03:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's all about a process and a
 
03:02:11.469 --> 03:02:11.479 align:start position:0%
transparent process and uh as far as uh
 
03:02:15.269 --> 03:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
that goes that's um my my part of the
 
03:02:18.309 --> 03:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
bill um Steve Wy from no will come up
 
03:02:20.750 --> 03:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
and talk about the changing it from the
 
03:02:23.830 --> 03:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh on the verified notification and how
 
03:02:27.269 --> 03:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:29.630 --> 03:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
now do we have any questions for the
 
03:02:32.670 --> 03:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
representative before he leaves his
 
03:02:36.510 --> 03:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
seat I don't see none thank
 
03:02:40.110 --> 03:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
you okay I didn't see any good thank you
 
03:02:40.120 --> 03:02:43.349 align:start position:0%
you okay I didn't see any good thank you
very

03:02:43.349 --> 03:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:47.190 --> 03:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
much hi thank you uh for hearing us and
 
03:02:51.030 --> 03:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
listening to this this bill we um over
 
03:02:55.110 --> 03:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
the last seven years uh we do represent
 
03:02:57.309 --> 03:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
all the ATV clubs in New Hampshire but
 
03:03:00.670 --> 03:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
we also represent all the Riders um and
 
03:03:03.150 --> 03:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities who have opened up their
 
03:03:04.670 --> 03:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
roads to
 
03:03:07.710 --> 03:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
ohvs um what has been very successful in
 
03:03:11.950 --> 03:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
the North Country in connecting um large
 
03:03:16.309 --> 03:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
riding areas um other towns across the
 
03:03:19.950 --> 03:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
state have opened up their local roads
 
03:03:21.510 --> 03:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
um to
 
03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:23.110 align:start position:0%
um to
ohvs

03:03:23.110 --> 03:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
ohvs
 
03:03:26.950 --> 03:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
um I passed out this piece of paper
 
03:03:30.389 --> 03:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
which has nothing but rsas outlining the
 
03:03:32.870 --> 03:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
processes and the the laws where a
 
03:03:36.269 --> 03:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
municipality can open this up and the
 
03:03:38.510 --> 03:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
way the laws are written a municipality
 
03:03:42.349 --> 03:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
can do this without a club and over the
 
03:03:45.590 --> 03:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
last seven years I've gotten numerous
 
03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
calls not just from a couple of clubs
 
03:03:49.510 --> 03:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
that would like to connect some of their
 
03:03:54.309 --> 03:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
riding areas but from residents and town
 
03:03:58.229 --> 03:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
Selectmen on how to connect their riding
 
03:04:01.710 --> 03:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
areas so we have places like cuden
 
03:04:04.790 --> 03:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
Washington now I find Windsor from the
 
03:04:04.800 --> 03:04:06.550 align:start position:0%
Washington now I find Windsor from the
HB

03:04:06.550 --> 03:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
HB
 
03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
113 um antrum who have opened up their
 
03:04:13.710 --> 03:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
roads to ohvs but they have a state road
 
03:04:16.150 --> 03:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
running right through the middle of town
 
03:04:18.950 --> 03:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
often times these roads are 25 30 m an
 
03:04:21.870 --> 03:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
hour uh short sections
 
03:04:25.190 --> 03:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
1,500 half a mile 3/4 of Mile right in
 
03:04:27.910 --> 03:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
town that they would like to connect one
 
03:04:30.070 --> 03:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
side of their town to the other when
 
03:04:33.910 --> 03:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
there isn't even a club there um ohrv
 
03:04:36.630 --> 03:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
has become very popular people don't
 
03:04:38.830 --> 03:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
just go up north to ride they want to
 
03:04:42.510 --> 03:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
ride around their home um municipalities
 
03:04:45.190 --> 03:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
have had control over their own roads
 
03:04:47.710 --> 03:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
for over 50 years and a lot of
 
03:04:49.510 --> 03:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities have opened up their
 
03:04:53.309 --> 03:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
class six roads to ohvs over 50 years
 
03:04:55.389 --> 03:04:55.399 align:start position:0%
ago and those are
 
03:04:59.510 --> 03:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
longstanding um uh ordinances it was
 
03:05:03.110 --> 03:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
2014 that they added class five roads
 
03:05:05.870 --> 03:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
and four roads and it was
 
03:05:09.550 --> 03:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
2017 that they added class one roads and
 
03:05:14.070 --> 03:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
two roads um which is what connected the
 
03:05:18.670 --> 03:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
major riding areas up North so the towns
 
03:05:20.389 --> 03:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
in the central and southern part of the
 
03:05:23.309 --> 03:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
state are like hey they're getting that
 
03:05:25.910 --> 03:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
benefit up there why don't we have this
 
03:05:28.950 --> 03:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
benefit and over and over I had to say
 
03:05:32.150 --> 03:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
well on a state road you can't do it
 
03:05:34.269 --> 03:05:34.279 align:start position:0%
unless you're in Grafton and Coos County
 
03:05:35.750 --> 03:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're like but we've opened up all our
 
03:05:38.389 --> 03:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
roads the RSA even says that we have
 
03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
control over all the roads in our town
 
03:05:44.750 --> 03:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
limits except for that state road so all
 
03:05:48.070 --> 03:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing is asking to add these five
 
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
other counties where I have received
 
03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
calls from uh different individuals and
 
03:05:57.030 --> 03:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
towns on trying to get on these small
 
03:06:00.110 --> 03:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
sections it's not to connect major
 
03:06:04.510 --> 03:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
riding areas like ride the Wilds was so
 
03:06:07.269 --> 03:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a unintended consequence
 
03:06:10.590 --> 03:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
of the tight laws that we did up north
 
03:06:13.630 --> 03:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
um focused just on ride the wilds and
 
03:06:17.190 --> 03:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
the the larger riding areas and we would
 
03:06:21.190 --> 03:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
like to extend that to these other five
 
03:06:25.070 --> 03:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities so when the verified mail
 
03:06:28.590 --> 03:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
came out it was targeted that these
 
03:06:31.429 --> 03:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
clubs had to pay for that and that was
 
03:06:33.190 --> 03:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
all fine and dandy when you've got a
 
03:06:36.269 --> 03:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
club up North with 800 members they make
 
03:06:39.030 --> 03:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know $115,000 a year they can afford
 
03:06:42.030 --> 03:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
it but some of our clubs down in Central
 
03:06:44.830 --> 03:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
and Southern New Hampshire only have 40
 
03:06:48.710 --> 03:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
50 members in their their their club
 
03:06:52.070 --> 03:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
with 10 miles of Trail um and they need
 
03:06:54.950 --> 03:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
a half a mile a road to connect their
 
03:06:57.510 --> 03:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
their riding areas so we we're not
 
03:07:00.630 --> 03:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
talking about making a ride the Wilds
 
03:07:04.070 --> 03:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
south or connecting all the riding areas
 
03:07:07.950 --> 03:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
we're just giving back local control to
 
03:07:11.030 --> 03:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
these municipalities to open up their
 
03:07:13.590 --> 03:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
short sections of Road through a
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
rigorous permitting process which starts
 
03:07:20.429 --> 03:07:20.439 align:start position:0%
at the town with notifications a butter
 
03:07:23.710 --> 03:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
notifications public hearing then with
 
03:07:27.950 --> 03:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
all that paperwork um apply to Bureau of
 
03:07:30.309 --> 03:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
trails once Bureau of trails goes
 
03:07:32.870 --> 03:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
through their list then they pass it on
 
03:07:36.910 --> 03:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
to uh do they go through their list
 
03:07:39.550 --> 03:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety gets a look at it
 
03:07:43.349 --> 03:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
and then the it goes back to the town
 
03:07:46.950 --> 03:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
and the town uh allows it to be opened
 
03:07:51.110 --> 03:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
so the the process is very very
 
03:07:54.429 --> 03:07:54.439 align:start position:0%
intensive um not every town is going to
 
03:07:56.030 --> 03:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
go through this they're they're not
 
03:07:58.070 --> 03:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
going to make big connections but some
 
03:08:00.269 --> 03:08:00.279 align:start position:0%
of these towns that their residents just
 
03:08:02.790 --> 03:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
want to get to the gas station to put
 
03:08:05.790 --> 03:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
fuel in or they want to get to the to
 
03:08:09.510 --> 03:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
the landfill to to put their trash there
 
03:08:12.870 --> 03:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
and and really we're not using roads for
 
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
recreation we're really using roads for
 
03:08:18.469 --> 03:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
transportation and because New Hampshire
 
03:08:21.630 --> 03:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
has really dug down in the definitions
 
03:08:23.710 --> 03:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
we we put ourselves into these really
 
03:08:27.190 --> 03:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
tight boxes and I would just like to
 
03:08:31.510 --> 03:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
encourage you to um pass this bill so
 
03:08:34.030 --> 03:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
that the local municipalities can have
 
03:08:37.750 --> 03:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
the power and control um upon themselves
 
03:08:40.910 --> 03:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
you know it it doesn't make it so that a
 
03:08:43.389 --> 03:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
club can't pay for the
 
03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
notifications but if you have a resident
 
03:08:47.950 --> 03:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
who just wants to get to his is class
 
03:08:51.550 --> 03:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
six Road um why why should that one
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
person have to pay for notifying all his
 
03:08:56.950 --> 03:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
neighbors just to get to that class six
 
03:09:01.590 --> 03:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
road so we we we would like to to not
 
03:09:04.389 --> 03:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
have to have the petitioner pay every
 
03:09:07.429 --> 03:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
time especially when it's just a a
 
03:09:12.110 --> 03:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
resident or two um to do that um in
 
03:09:17.030 --> 03:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
Claremont where my local Club is we um
 
03:09:19.710 --> 03:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
used to go to the city every year for
 
03:09:21.590 --> 03:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
permission they would sign a permission
 
03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
form when the butter notification law
 
03:09:27.070 --> 03:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
came to be in
 
03:09:31.229 --> 03:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
2019 um we had to go back and for a mile
 
03:09:35.190 --> 03:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
and a quarter road we had the city send
 
03:09:37.750 --> 03:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
out 297
 
03:09:40.990 --> 03:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
notifications it cost our Club close to
 
03:09:43.910 --> 03:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
$1,000 to get notified for a mile and a
 
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
quarter of Road um they included all the
 
03:09:49.870 --> 03:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
class six rows that were already open um
 
03:09:51.030 --> 03:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
03:09:54.349 --> 03:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
297 notifications some of them it was
 
03:09:58.349 --> 03:09:58.359 align:start position:0%
two or three per residents so a married
 
03:10:01.389 --> 03:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
couple that was two notifications so we
 
03:10:04.469 --> 03:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
had to pay that double um
 
03:10:07.590 --> 03:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
notification at the hearing 11 people
 
03:10:11.710 --> 03:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
showed up to to to just be there out of
 
03:10:15.429 --> 03:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
the 11 people six spoke out against it
 
03:10:17.309 --> 03:10:17.319 align:start position:0%
and only two of those people who spoke
 
03:10:19.469 --> 03:10:19.479 align:start position:0%
fol against it lived on that mile and a
 
03:10:23.229 --> 03:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
quarter road so out of almost 300
 
03:10:25.910 --> 03:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
notifications we really had two abutters
 
03:10:28.269 --> 03:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
along that whole section who spoke out
 
03:10:30.910 --> 03:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
against it the city council passed it
 
03:10:34.910 --> 03:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
the club was was able to pay and do that
 
03:10:38.030 --> 03:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
now we have four other ways up into what
 
03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
we call the cat hole Trails but the club
 
03:10:43.269 --> 03:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to spend you know that
 
03:10:46.990 --> 03:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
money to just let the residents access
 
03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:47.750 align:start position:0%
money to just let the residents access
that

03:10:47.750 --> 03:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:10:51.670 --> 03:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
we have our road from our parking up to
 
03:10:55.670 --> 03:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
there um but when residents want the
 
03:10:58.630 --> 03:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
access it should be the residents who
 
03:11:02.469 --> 03:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
maybe pay for that notification process
 
03:11:04.670 --> 03:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing we have in Claremont is
 
03:11:07.150 --> 03:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
at the racetrack they just built a
 
03:11:09.670 --> 03:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
campground the campground owner reached
 
03:11:11.550 --> 03:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
out to the club and said hey we want to
 
03:11:14.550 --> 03:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
connect to the cat hole but there are 60
 
03:11:17.550 --> 03:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
residents along that road and at doesn't
 
03:11:20.510 --> 03:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
do anything for the club but the
 
03:11:24.630 --> 03:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
campground wants access so um who who
 
03:11:26.429 --> 03:11:26.439 align:start position:0%
pays would it be the club or the
 
03:11:26.439 --> 03:11:27.870 align:start position:0%
pays would it be the club or the
campground

03:11:27.870 --> 03:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
campground
 
03:11:30.590 --> 03:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
so when it's up in the air like that
 
03:11:34.429 --> 03:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
then nothing happens and so it it just
 
03:11:38.309 --> 03:11:38.319 align:start position:0%
seems like um it's it's been targeted
 
03:11:41.229 --> 03:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
the clubs have been targeted
 
03:11:44.389 --> 03:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
unfairly um because it was all based on
 
03:11:47.590 --> 03:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
what's Happening up north and not what
 
03:11:50.070 --> 03:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
is happening in these individual small
 
03:11:53.349 --> 03:11:53.359 align:start position:0%
places in Central and Southern New
 
03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that would conclude most of
 
03:12:00.510 --> 03:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
my testimony um we have written
 
03:12:03.070 --> 03:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
testimony but uh as I said I've
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
highlighted all the important points on
 
03:12:09.309 --> 03:12:09.319 align:start position:0%
how the processes are covered under the
 
03:12:16.309 --> 03:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
RSA and there is a um five or six page
 
03:12:16.319 --> 03:12:18.190 align:start position:0%
RSA and there is a um five or six page
um

03:12:18.190 --> 03:12:18.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:20.670 --> 03:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
application process this outlines all
 
03:12:23.389 --> 03:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
the things that the clubs and the agent
 
03:12:27.190 --> 03:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
state agencies have to do uh to go
 
03:12:29.389 --> 03:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
through that permitting process I didn't
 
03:12:31.190 --> 03:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
do all the copies of this because it's
 
03:12:34.710 --> 03:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
just so much um but we can email that to
 
03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
the committee if they want to hear or
 
03:12:39.550 --> 03:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
read any questions from Mr
 
03:12:42.870 --> 03:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
wilky representative Bri thank you Mr
 
03:12:46.349 --> 03:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for my question um as I
 
03:12:47.710 --> 03:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
understand it this
 
03:12:51.070 --> 03:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
uh practice is already in use up north
 
03:12:53.870 --> 03:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
and this bill simply
 
03:12:57.870 --> 03:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
allows other municipalities counties to
 
03:13:00.590 --> 03:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
use the same
 
03:13:04.870 --> 03:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
practice this bill if passed does not
 
03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
open up the wild west on roads it
 
03:13:09.950 --> 03:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't it actually if passed doesn't
 
03:13:12.150 --> 03:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
even increase
 
03:13:17.349 --> 03:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
ohrv Trails one mile unless people go
 
03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
through the practice that's in here I
 
03:13:20.150 --> 03:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that was clear
 
03:13:23.590 --> 03:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct 100% this will not
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
open up any bit of Trail all of it still
 
03:13:29.429 --> 03:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
has to go through process you still have
 
03:13:33.309 --> 03:13:33.319 align:start position:0%
to get landowner um permission which is
 
03:13:36.590 --> 03:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
the municipality then if it's on State
 
03:13:38.790 --> 03:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
Road then Bureau
 
03:13:43.309 --> 03:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
Trails okay and Dot thank you ERS of n
 
03:13:44.590 --> 03:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:13:46.309 --> 03:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
my question just to clarify you think
 
03:13:48.070 --> 03:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
the cost of the notification toter
 
03:13:49.630 --> 03:13:49.640 align:start position:0%
should be born by the
 
03:13:52.110 --> 03:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities is that correct yes so it
 
03:13:55.349 --> 03:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's requires verified mail uh verified
 
03:13:58.070 --> 03:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
mail is just proof that it was mailed
 
03:14:00.870 --> 03:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's not certified mail um some people
 
03:14:03.070 --> 03:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
can't uh grasp the difference between
 
03:14:05.389 --> 03:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
certified certified you get a receipt
 
03:14:07.510 --> 03:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
saying the person signed for it this
 
03:14:09.750 --> 03:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
just proves that it was mailed which a
 
03:14:12.550 --> 03:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
municipality has to keep track of anyway
 
03:14:15.229 --> 03:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
for the right to no law they have the
 
03:14:17.550 --> 03:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
list of people that they sent so we're
 
03:14:21.070 --> 03:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
kind of like paying for it twice um just
 
03:14:23.110 --> 03:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
the post office giving a receipt that
 
03:14:25.830 --> 03:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
these did get actually mailed when the
 
03:14:27.950 --> 03:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
municipality has to keep track of all
 
03:14:30.590 --> 03:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
this data
 
03:14:33.670 --> 03:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
also any other questions from Mr wilky
 
03:14:33.680 --> 03:14:34.790 align:start position:0%
also any other questions from Mr wilky
representative

03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:14:37.150 --> 03:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
Taylor thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
for taking the question the bill adds
 
03:14:43.790 --> 03:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
five counties to the two existing for
 
03:14:46.670 --> 03:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
this do you have any idea how many towns
 
03:14:49.950 --> 03:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
in those five counties would be impacted
 
03:14:53.150 --> 03:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
by this well there none would be
 
03:14:56.910 --> 03:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
impacted I mean those towns can open up
 
03:14:59.590 --> 03:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
their roads already there is that
 
03:15:03.429 --> 03:15:03.439 align:start position:0%
process all this does is adds the state
 
03:15:06.190 --> 03:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
roads that might go through that town to
 
03:15:09.269 --> 03:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
be able to be opened as I stated the the
 
03:15:11.710 --> 03:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
town of Washington the town of Cen the
 
03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
town of Windsor and and antrum I have
 
03:15:18.229 --> 03:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
heard from all four of those towns that
 
03:15:20.710 --> 03:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
they have their roads open already and
 
03:15:23.469 --> 03:15:23.479 align:start position:0%
they just want to connect them so I I
 
03:15:25.229 --> 03:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that this legislation
 
03:15:27.790 --> 03:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
would encourage other towns to rush out
 
03:15:30.269 --> 03:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
and open up their roads just to get on a
 
03:15:33.229 --> 03:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
small section of State Road this really
 
03:15:36.910 --> 03:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
is only speaking about state roads as
 
03:15:39.429 --> 03:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
far as adding the five
 
03:15:44.110 --> 03:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
counties you're welcome representative
 
03:15:47.429 --> 03:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
Vil thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
03:15:50.030 --> 03:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question so we're adding five
 
03:15:53.590 --> 03:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
counties and what about um Rockingham
 
03:15:55.349 --> 03:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
and bellnap counties why aren't they
 
03:15:59.750 --> 03:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
included in the bill so I um suggested
 
03:16:02.189 --> 03:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
that these five counties um because
 
03:16:04.030 --> 03:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
these are counties where I have actually
 
03:16:08.349 --> 03:16:08.359 align:start position:0%
heard people call and say I am here we
 
03:16:11.070 --> 03:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
would like this here um I didn't hear
 
03:16:13.389 --> 03:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
from anyone in Rockingham County or the
 
03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
other County so that is how these five
 
03:16:18.429 --> 03:16:18.439 align:start position:0%
were chosen because the towns have
 
03:16:20.590 --> 03:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
already opened up their roads and they
 
03:16:24.750 --> 03:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
just want Road use so it was
 
03:16:31.790 --> 03:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:34.990 --> 03:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
demand thank derby um thank you for
 
03:16:37.070 --> 03:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question as I understand the
 
03:16:39.710 --> 03:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
statute um currently the towns can
 
03:16:42.229 --> 03:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
already open up their sidewalks adjacent
 
03:16:44.830 --> 03:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
to these state roads as well so they
 
03:16:47.910 --> 03:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
have an option for example to put in a
 
03:16:51.070 --> 03:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
sidewalk if they chose to open up this
 
03:16:51.080 --> 03:16:53.309 align:start position:0%
sidewalk if they chose to open up this
access

03:16:53.309 --> 03:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
access
 
03:16:56.469 --> 03:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
already um I don't know the process of
 
03:17:00.349 --> 03:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
installing sidewalks on a state road but
 
03:17:03.630 --> 03:17:03.640 align:start position:0%
I could imagine that would be um a much
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
larger debate but if there was a
 
03:17:08.070 --> 03:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
sidewalk there sidewalks have been able
 
03:17:11.150 --> 03:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
to be used for many many years even
 
03:17:13.110 --> 03:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
before we were allowed on any of the
 
03:17:16.150 --> 03:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
roads so that has been in statute a lot
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:22.349 --> 03:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
use anyone
 
03:17:25.229 --> 03:17:25.239 align:start position:0%

probably know was established in 2022 to
 
03:18:47.150 --> 03:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
find ways the state of New Hampshire
 
03:18:49.070 --> 03:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
could mitigate conflicts between
 
03:18:52.670 --> 03:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
motorized and non-motorized Trail users
 
03:18:56.070 --> 03:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
as a forest land owner on occasion we
 
03:18:59.269 --> 03:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
use an ATV when doing management work on
 
03:19:02.150 --> 03:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
our property the machine is a useful
 
03:19:05.710 --> 03:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
tool and can access the wood lot where
 
03:19:07.990 --> 03:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
using our tractor is Not
 
03:19:10.309 --> 03:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
Practical um in
 
03:19:13.389 --> 03:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
2024 the American Tree Farm

03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
one of four top tree farmers in the
 
03:19:20.399 --> 03:19:23.150 align:start position:0%
one of four top tree farmers in the
United

03:19:23.150 --> 03:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:25.950 --> 03:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
States I'm opposed to this bill for
 
03:19:28.590 --> 03:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
several reasons including the bill
 
03:19:30.750 --> 03:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
states that abutters will be
 
03:19:34.110 --> 03:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
notified however because it's
 
03:19:37.870 --> 03:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
unclear in my mind anyway in the in the
 
03:19:40.229 --> 03:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
writing of the bill the petitioning
 
03:19:44.389 --> 03:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
party no longer must bear this this
 
03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
expense is it the sponsors intention
 
03:19:50.030 --> 03:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
that municipalities should shoulder this
 
03:19:54.309 --> 03:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
cost if yes is that fair when these
 
03:19:57.070 --> 03:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
entities also will bear additional costs
 
03:20:01.389 --> 03:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement Road repairs Etc
 
03:20:04.269 --> 03:20:04.279 align:start position:0%
resulting from a change use the
 
03:20:07.070 --> 03:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
petitioning organization should bear the
 
03:20:11.590 --> 03:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
notification cost law enforcement ask
 
03:20:14.670 --> 03:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
virtually any law enforcement officer
 
03:20:18.150 --> 03:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
including the police chief in willment
 
03:20:21.110 --> 03:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
and he will he or she will readily admit
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
that their department whether it's a
 
03:20:26.590 --> 03:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
town County the state of New Hampshire
 
03:20:29.309 --> 03:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
or fish and game does not have the
 
03:20:31.750 --> 03:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
Staffing to address current enforcement
 
03:20:34.510 --> 03:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
issues on Trails expanding the
 
03:20:39.030 --> 03:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for Ohr V use on state roads
 
03:20:42.150 --> 03:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
in Caroll chesher Hillsboro marac and
 
03:20:44.910 --> 03:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
Sullivan counties could increase the
 
03:20:47.790 --> 03:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
workload for these law enforc ment
 
03:20:51.349 --> 03:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
folks uh who do not have the Staffing to
 
03:20:53.990 --> 03:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
take care of the work that they already
 
03:20:57.790 --> 03:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
have um as a matter of fact in Coos
 
03:21:00.910 --> 03:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
there are 17 people per square mile
 
03:21:04.990 --> 03:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
Grafton County 55 people per square mile
 
03:21:08.030 --> 03:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
in comparison in Sullivan there the
 
03:21:10.990 --> 03:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
population density is 82 people per
 
03:21:14.229 --> 03:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
square mile in chesher County it's
 
03:21:17.110 --> 03:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
110 Marram County
 
03:21:19.910 --> 03:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
69 and Hillsboro County
 
03:21:23.189 --> 03:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
338 so the possibility for a butter
 
03:21:26.150 --> 03:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
impact if this were changed and yes it
 
03:21:28.269 --> 03:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
would be approved through the town but
 
03:21:30.950 --> 03:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
the change would cause an impact on
 
03:21:33.389 --> 03:21:33.399 align:start position:0%
these higher density
 
03:21:33.399 --> 03:21:35.710 align:start position:0%
these higher density
counties

03:21:35.710 --> 03:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
counties
 
03:21:38.469 --> 03:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
safety I think it would be dangerous to
 
03:21:43.710 --> 03:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
allow ohvs on state class 1 2 3 and 3A
 
03:21:47.110 --> 03:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
roads in these in these counties these
 
03:21:50.510 --> 03:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
roads are larger they have faster speed
 
03:21:53.910 --> 03:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
limits and they are mostly
 
03:21:57.389 --> 03:21:57.399 align:start position:0%
paved and finally as a member of the
 
03:22:01.469 --> 03:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
ohrv study commission and I've been so
 
03:22:04.429 --> 03:22:04.439 align:start position:0%

03:22:13.990 --> 03:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
effects of ohrv use on state and town
 
03:22:16.950 --> 03:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
roads including class 5 and class six
 
03:22:21.790 --> 03:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
roads I've included a copy of that uh
 
03:22:25.710 --> 03:22:25.720 align:start position:0%

this not to um reiterate what Steve

Wilkey was saying but we are one of the
 
03:25:31.510 --> 03:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
towns where a state road goes through
 
03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
and it
 
03:25:37.550 --> 03:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
is a known thing that if you go on the
 
03:25:39.830 --> 03:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
State Road between Valley Street and old
 
03:25:42.870 --> 03:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
Marlo road which is a 30 m hour yeah the
 
03:25:45.590 --> 03:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
people will look the other way and to me
 
03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
that's not okay we we we are trying to
 
03:25:50.269 --> 03:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
get to the general store which has a gas
 
03:25:52.389 --> 03:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
station fueling um so mobiles have a
 
03:25:53.950 --> 03:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
trail that goes directly there right
 
03:25:56.830 --> 03:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
across the state road um ohvs are
 
03:25:59.750 --> 03:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
technically not allowed um we have
 
03:26:02.830 --> 03:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
multiple lakes around the area um a lot
 
03:26:05.229 --> 03:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
of Summer Camps summer residents um they
 
03:26:08.469 --> 03:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
are mostly using um side by sides to get
 
03:26:12.710 --> 03:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
around town um I have spoken to um our
 
03:26:16.309 --> 03:26:16.319 align:start position:0%

our our um Bo excuse me not don't have
 
03:26:25.910 --> 03:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
anything in front of me uh the Town
 
03:26:28.790 --> 03:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
garage the Ed theer he's he runs Our
 
03:26:30.229 --> 03:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
Town garage and takes care of the roads
 
03:26:33.750 --> 03:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
and they are all in favor of of opening
 
03:26:36.070 --> 03:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
up our roads and getting links to these
 
03:26:38.429 --> 03:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
Trails which are Classics roads we have
 
03:26:40.429 --> 03:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
a great network of Classics roads I use
 
03:26:43.229 --> 03:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
them um multiple people use them walking
 
03:26:47.229 --> 03:26:47.239 align:start position:0%
and Etc but the the State Road in
 
03:26:50.229 --> 03:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
between is blocking us um and we would
 
03:26:52.590 --> 03:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
like to have the opportunity to be able
 
03:26:55.550 --> 03:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
to explore the the possibility of
 
03:26:57.630 --> 03:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
opening that up and making it actually
 
03:27:00.429 --> 03:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
legal uh whereas the snowmobiling is
 
03:27:02.269 --> 03:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
getting smaller and smaller the our
 
03:27:04.750 --> 03:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
general store is getting less and less
 
03:27:06.790 --> 03:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
people coming there for during the
 
03:27:08.990 --> 03:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
winter making it harder for him to stay
 
03:27:12.550 --> 03:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
open um and bringing in
 
03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
this state road into some use in the 30
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
mph zones at least we can achieve a
 
03:27:21.309 --> 03:27:21.319 align:start position:0%
little bit more income coming into that
 
03:27:22.590 --> 03:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
General Store and we don't want to lose
 
03:27:24.469 --> 03:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
our general store we want to open up the
 
03:27:27.110 --> 03:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
roads that that are applicable do it
 
03:27:29.630 --> 03:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
responsible with a good signage working
 
03:27:32.030 --> 03:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
with the the police our Police
 
03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
Department um our police department and
 
03:27:37.429 --> 03:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
fire department both have gotten grants
 
03:27:39.910 --> 03:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
for side byid so they can get out onto
 
03:27:43.750 --> 03:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
the roads if they need um Muro uh he's
 
03:27:46.309 --> 03:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
the chief of police he worked in in um
 
03:27:50.349 --> 03:27:50.359 align:start position:0%
um henker opening the trails there
 
03:27:53.389 --> 03:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
and he told me that he was surprised on
 
03:27:55.710 --> 03:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
the lack of incidents that occurred in
 
03:27:57.870 --> 03:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
that area he was kind of against it at
 
03:28:00.790 --> 03:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
at the F first and so he's on board in
 
03:28:03.309 --> 03:28:03.319 align:start position:0%
Washington bringing on board to to
 
03:28:05.469 --> 03:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
connect those trails and opening up
 
03:28:07.510 --> 03:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
certain corridors just to make links to
 
03:28:09.750 --> 03:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
our classic roads and that does pertain
 
03:28:12.389 --> 03:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
to some state
 
03:28:17.469 --> 03:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
roads so that is basically my bit
 
03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for Mr
 
03:28:22.389 --> 03:28:22.399 align:start position:0%

03:28:27.510 --> 03:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
testimony opposing the bill Gary
 
03:28:32.990 --> 03:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:35.309 --> 03:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
Randall Mr
 
03:28:37.349 --> 03:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
Newfield thank you chairman committee
 
03:28:39.429 --> 03:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
members I appreciate the opportunity to
 
03:28:41.870 --> 03:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
be here my name is Gary Newfield I live
 
03:28:43.830 --> 03:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
in Coos County in the town of Randolph
 
03:28:45.510 --> 03:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
and I've seen firsthand the conflicts
 
03:28:47.110 --> 03:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
that have Arisen with with ohvs in the
 
03:28:49.469 --> 03:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
general public I'm the chairman of the
 
03:28:51.150 --> 03:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
Randolph Conservation Commission and on
 
03:28:53.510 --> 03:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
this local Zoning Board of adjustment
 
03:28:55.469 --> 03:28:55.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm a member of the ohrv study
 
03:28:56.550 --> 03:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
commission representing the New
 
03:28:58.150 --> 03:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of conservation
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
commissions I write an opposition to HB
 
03:29:04.830 --> 03:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
683 I feel that this bill is an end run
 
03:29:06.510 --> 03:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
around public notice by taking away
 
03:29:09.229 --> 03:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
certified mail notification of a Butters
 
03:29:10.750 --> 03:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
when a landowner wants to make changes
 
03:29:12.429 --> 03:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
to their property a butter notification
 
03:29:14.150 --> 03:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
is key to making sure that citizens are
 
03:29:17.269 --> 03:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
aware of changes to their community ohvs
 
03:29:19.950 --> 03:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
have a huge impact on the makeup of the
 
03:29:22.389 --> 03:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
community through which they travel an
 
03:29:24.309 --> 03:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate notification by certified
 
03:29:26.670 --> 03:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
male should remain the standard way to
 
03:29:28.429 --> 03:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
communicate with affected
 
03:29:31.070 --> 03:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
citizens we all know that fish and game
 
03:29:33.030 --> 03:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
and local law enforcement are underst
 
03:29:35.389 --> 03:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
staffed therefore opening more roads
 
03:29:38.429 --> 03:29:38.439 align:start position:0%
ohvs is nothing short of a recipe for
 
03:29:40.910 --> 03:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
disaster the ohrv commission is well
 
03:29:43.710 --> 03:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
aware of this as it is a frequent topic
 
03:29:43.720 --> 03:29:44.550 align:start position:0%
aware of this as it is a frequent topic
of

03:29:44.550 --> 03:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:29:46.990 --> 03:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
discussion Paul D party past
 
03:29:48.830 --> 03:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of fishing game when
 
03:29:50.030 --> 03:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with conflicts between
 
03:29:52.830 --> 03:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles and nonmotorized Recreation
 
03:29:56.030 --> 03:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
has said the way to end the conflict was
 
03:29:59.750 --> 03:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
to separate the users ohvs are designed
 
03:30:02.309 --> 03:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
to be used on Trails not roads not in
 
03:30:04.269 --> 03:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
close proximity to homes where they
 
03:30:06.870 --> 03:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
disturb the peace and quiet of the
 
03:30:09.590 --> 03:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods also in the North Country
 
03:30:11.630 --> 03:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
a Butters have given up filing
 
03:30:14.070 --> 03:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
complaints about ohvs because of the
 
03:30:16.550 --> 03:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
lack of law enforcement by the time the
 
03:30:19.110 --> 03:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
complaint is filed the ohvs are long
 
03:30:22.229 --> 03:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
gone Andor there are no law enforcement
 
03:30:25.269 --> 03:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
officers available expanding ohrv
 
03:30:26.910 --> 03:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
activity in this current environment is
 
03:30:28.510 --> 03:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
just plain wrong and would do a
 
03:30:30.189 --> 03:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
disservice to the general
 
03:30:32.630 --> 03:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
public the state also has spent
 
03:30:34.670 --> 03:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars litigating
 
03:30:37.030 --> 03:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
omv's disruption of a neighborhood in
 
03:30:39.429 --> 03:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
gorm New Hampshire if the state had
 
03:30:42.790 --> 03:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
followed Paul D's pesent thoughts this
 
03:30:45.710 --> 03:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
is this issue would never have occurred
 
03:30:48.229 --> 03:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
p mage of this bill will only exacerbate
 
03:30:50.750 --> 03:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
the continuing conflicts of ohvs versus
 
03:30:53.030 --> 03:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
homeowners the state is entering a time
 
03:30:55.150 --> 03:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
of fiscal uncertainty and this is no
 
03:30:56.870 --> 03:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
time to be opening the door for more
 
03:30:59.510 --> 03:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuits I therefore am opposed to HB
 
03:31:02.229 --> 03:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
683 and ask you to oppose the
 
03:31:05.670 --> 03:31:05.680 align:start position:0%

Livy say it right from Keen
 
03:31:25.870 --> 03:31:25.880 align:start position:0%

Club good afternoon everybody in the
 
03:31:31.349 --> 03:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
committee um I just try to keep it short
 
03:31:34.510 --> 03:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh I represent the mount Pisa ATV Club
 
03:31:36.990 --> 03:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
where we have uh two Trail systems one
 
03:31:39.510 --> 03:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
in Winchester and Hampshire one in
 
03:31:43.429 --> 03:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale um we operate a very extensive
 
03:31:46.389 --> 03:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh trail system in Pisa State Park
 
03:31:50.229 --> 03:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
um where we have uh also upgraded uh the
 
03:31:53.349 --> 03:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
trail system there uh we share that
 
03:31:57.150 --> 03:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
trail system um with u hikers Walkers
 
03:32:00.710 --> 03:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
equestrians snowmobiles and dog sled
 
03:32:03.269 --> 03:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
mushers uh because of the effort that we
 
03:32:05.349 --> 03:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
put into that trail system all those
 
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
user groups have had uh success in um
 
03:32:13.990 --> 03:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
using um the upgraded trails with uh
 
03:32:17.510 --> 03:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
Bridges and um resurfacing Etc we've
 
03:32:19.630 --> 03:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
been able to raise in the last six years
 
03:32:19.640 --> 03:32:21.950 align:start position:0%
been able to raise in the last six years
over

03:32:21.950 --> 03:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:25.349 --> 03:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
$237,000 uh in donations and state aid
 
03:32:27.630 --> 03:32:27.640 align:start position:0%
um and through a volunteer effort have
 
03:32:30.309 --> 03:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
been able to make quite an impact on
 
03:32:35.510 --> 03:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
both Trail systems as a club um we have
 
03:32:39.389 --> 03:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
uh seven miles uh in between the two uh
 
03:32:41.429 --> 03:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
Trails where we have landowner
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
permission to um make a connector Trail
 
03:32:47.750 --> 03:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
which will cross cross just simply one
 
03:32:53.910 --> 03:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
short road on Route 63 and then we have
 
03:32:58.710 --> 03:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
asked the town of uh Hinsdale to exit um
 
03:33:02.630 --> 03:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
119 on the North Hinsdale Road uh to be
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
able to access gas and um some
 
03:33:09.830 --> 03:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
restaurants um and a few other uh
 
03:33:14.309 --> 03:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities on that side so basically
 
03:33:18.030 --> 03:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
um we feel that as the club we've had a
 
03:33:20.830 --> 03:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
pretty good impact on uh upgrading
 
03:33:24.670 --> 03:33:24.680 align:start position:0%
Trails bringing economic um uh boost to
 
03:33:27.309 --> 03:33:27.319 align:start position:0%
both the uh Winchester town and hensdale
 
03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
town we have a lot of residents Town
 
03:33:33.910 --> 03:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
officials that um support us and we feel
 
03:33:35.830 --> 03:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
that as a club that this particular
 
03:33:40.110 --> 03:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill uh with allowing uh some Road
 
03:33:42.950 --> 03:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
Crossings and connector Trails which are
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
usually uh very short and um mileage
 
03:33:49.590 --> 03:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
would uh benefit our particular club and
 
03:33:52.510 --> 03:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
the two towns that's basically it
 
03:33:55.429 --> 03:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
anybody got any questions questions for
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
the speaker representative Sergeant
 
03:33:59.550 --> 03:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:34:01.790 --> 03:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question I was just wondering
 
03:34:04.670 --> 03:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
do you charge members
 
03:34:08.309 --> 03:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
dues yes and have you had any problems
 
03:34:10.710 --> 03:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
paying up followup Mr chairman follow go
 
03:34:12.189 --> 03:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
ahead have you ever had any problems
 
03:34:14.349 --> 03:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
paying for the abutter notices on these
 
03:34:17.790 --> 03:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
changes that you've just talked about no
 
03:34:20.990 --> 03:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
than any other questions for the speaker
 
03:34:23.110 --> 03:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:34:25.110 --> 03:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
03:34:27.670 --> 03:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
you and I'll just mention I have eight
 
03:34:29.990 --> 03:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
pink cards and they're all opposed so I
 
03:34:32.429 --> 03:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
don't have any more in support so we'll
 
03:34:38.990 --> 03:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:41.429 --> 03:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
opposition good afternoon chairman and
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I'm going to
 
03:34:45.349 --> 03:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
start with a question uh why isn't
 
03:34:48.830 --> 03:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
anyone in this room smoking or vaping
 
03:34:52.030 --> 03:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
there are probably 40 people here right
 
03:34:54.469 --> 03:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
there's got to be one who wants to uh
 
03:34:56.910 --> 03:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
well the reason of course is that uh New
 
03:35:00.269 --> 03:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in about 1990 25 years after
 
03:35:02.110 --> 03:35:02.120 align:start position:0%
Surgeon General report and about 10
 
03:35:04.750 --> 03:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
after secondhand smoke was shown to be
 
03:35:07.070 --> 03:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
bad for other people too uh they passed
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
the indoor smoking act uh behind the law
 
03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
is very simple idea everyone's actions
 
03:35:13.830 --> 03:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
should take into account their effects
 
03:35:16.990 --> 03:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
on others it's basically the Golden Rule
 
03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
which is part of pretty much every
 
03:35:20.990 --> 03:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
religion you can think of in recorded
 
03:35:23.150 --> 03:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
history another way of thinking about it
 
03:35:25.630 --> 03:35:25.640 align:start position:0%
is your right to walk down the street
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
swinging your fist stops at the point of
 
03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
my nose or in this case your right to
 
03:35:33.030 --> 03:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
drive a noisy vehicle stops at the drums
 
03:35:38.110 --> 03:35:38.120 align:start position:0%
of my ears so um economists uh it's the
 
03:35:40.030 --> 03:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
same idea as being a good neighbor and
 
03:35:41.870 --> 03:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
economists talk about neighborhood
 
03:35:44.630 --> 03:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
effects to refer to things that are
 
03:35:46.070 --> 03:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
either good for the other people in the
 
03:35:47.710 --> 03:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
neighborhood like planting beautiful
 
03:35:50.990 --> 03:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
flowers that every could enjoy or having
 
03:35:52.910 --> 03:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know emitting air pollution that
 
03:35:54.750 --> 03:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
everyone in the neighborhood gets to
 
03:35:56.349 --> 03:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
breathe regardless of whether they're
 
03:36:00.349 --> 03:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
getting paid for producing or not so um
 
03:36:02.189 --> 03:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
another use term they use for them is
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
externalities and they can be there good
 
03:36:06.990 --> 03:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
or bad positive or negative so
 
03:36:09.710 --> 03:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
consistent with our state motto we let
 
03:36:12.229 --> 03:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
adults ride motorcycles without helmets
 
03:36:14.429 --> 03:36:14.439 align:start position:0%
we let adults drive cars without seat
 
03:36:16.670 --> 03:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
belts the idea is that those choosing to
 
03:36:19.910 --> 03:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
do so are only endangering themselves
 
03:36:21.990 --> 03:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
there are no negative externalities from
 
03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
their actions which are obviously from a
 
03:36:26.670 --> 03:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
statistical standpoint not great for
 
03:36:30.030 --> 03:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
human health right um now you can argue
 
03:36:32.110 --> 03:36:32.120 align:start position:0%
whether there are negative externalities
 
03:36:34.309 --> 03:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
here because if someone goes through a
 
03:36:36.510 --> 03:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
windshield in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:36:39.309 --> 03:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
any hospital he's taken to has an option
 
03:36:42.189 --> 03:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
has a obligation to try to put them back
 
03:36:44.910 --> 03:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
together as well as as best as they can
 
03:36:46.630 --> 03:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
and regardless of their ability to pay
 
03:36:48.389 --> 03:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
so in many cases it does end up in the
 
03:36:50.110 --> 03:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
insurance company's hands or the
 
03:36:51.630 --> 03:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
government's hands and of course it ends
 
03:36:53.110 --> 03:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
up in the insurance company's hands it
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
ends up in all of our in all of our
 
03:36:57.389 --> 03:36:57.399 align:start position:0%
premiums so that's a debatable point but
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
we'll ignore that for the time being so
 
03:37:03.269 --> 03:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
HB 683 poses the same question as lots
 
03:37:05.469 --> 03:37:05.479 align:start position:0%
of government policies how do we weigh
 
03:37:07.550 --> 03:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
competing interests how do we weigh the
 
03:37:10.830 --> 03:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
winners versus the losers in this case
 
03:37:14.110 --> 03:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
those who enjoy riding ohvs which I'm
 
03:37:16.110 --> 03:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
sure is a blast I mean driving a car on
 
03:37:18.910 --> 03:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
a windy road is is one of the great joys
 
03:37:21.710 --> 03:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
in life uh you get to do it on a trail
 
03:37:22.910 --> 03:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
where you can go where you want you can
 
03:37:25.070 --> 03:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
get airborne sometimes I'm sure it's I'm
 
03:37:30.349 --> 03:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
sure it's great fun um uh and and so do
 
03:37:32.710 --> 03:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
we want to make it essentially easier
 
03:37:34.630 --> 03:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
for them to do it in more places or
 
03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
literally to reduce the cost of it as
 
03:37:39.469 --> 03:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
has been referred to in previous uh
 
03:37:41.269 --> 03:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
testimony about uh notification
 
03:37:42.550 --> 03:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
requirements and obviously when you
 
03:37:44.309 --> 03:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of something you're
 
03:37:46.110 --> 03:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
going to increase that right that's just
 
03:37:48.269 --> 03:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
basic um
 
03:37:52.870 --> 03:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
so what are the principles here
 
03:37:55.590 --> 03:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
um uh there's a guy an economist named
 
03:37:58.070 --> 03:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
Coast who showed that private
 
03:38:00.910 --> 03:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
negotiations could in fact produce
 
03:38:03.229 --> 03:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
efficient out output out outcomes in
 
03:38:05.349 --> 03:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
this sort of situation so let's say a
 
03:38:08.030 --> 03:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
guy named Joe who wants to start raising
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
chickens on his property in a
 
03:38:12.309 --> 03:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhood and he has four
 
03:38:14.349 --> 03:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
neighbors who would be able to hear the
 
03:38:17.429 --> 03:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
chickens and uh if he's going to make
 
03:38:20.830 --> 03:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
500 bucks a month and he can and each of
 
03:38:22.950 --> 03:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
the four neighbors is satisfied with
 
03:38:25.189 --> 03:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
receiving $100 a month to put up with
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
the new the noise then he's going to do
 
03:38:30.229 --> 03:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
it he's going to get 500 pay out 400
 
03:38:33.070 --> 03:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
still having a $100 profit right but if
 
03:38:36.189 --> 03:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
the four neighbors say no no no I need
 
03:38:40.110 --> 03:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
150 so to be woken up every morning then
 
03:38:42.349 --> 03:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
you're up to 600 bucks he's only going
 
03:38:44.510 --> 03:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
to make 500 he's not going to do it so
 
03:38:47.469 --> 03:38:47.479 align:start position:0%
you get an efficient outcome I.E the
 
03:38:49.510 --> 03:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
greater productivity if it leads to
 
03:38:51.590 --> 03:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
Greater productivity it happens if it
 
03:38:53.790 --> 03:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't happen now the
 
03:38:56.030 --> 03:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
problem we have of course is that as
 
03:38:58.349 --> 03:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
soon as you get past a very small group
 
03:39:00.510 --> 03:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
of people involved it's impossible to
 
03:39:02.630 --> 03:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
negotiate everything right so for
 
03:39:04.790 --> 03:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
instance we couldn't replace the Clean
 
03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
Air or or water ax
 
03:39:12.070 --> 03:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
with interrupting you um I appreciate
 
03:39:14.349 --> 03:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
your analogies but can you be more
 
03:39:16.429 --> 03:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
specific to the bill
 
03:39:18.830 --> 03:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
focus on the bill there are other people
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
that would like to speak also sure so so
 
03:39:24.510 --> 03:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
in this case obviously you're not going
 
03:39:26.990 --> 03:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to negotiate between the
 
03:39:30.510 --> 03:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds or thousands of ohrv riders who
 
03:39:33.030 --> 03:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
are going to go on these roads and the
 
03:39:35.110 --> 03:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
equal or larger number of people who are
 
03:39:37.510 --> 03:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
going to be passed by their houses by a
 
03:39:39.550 --> 03:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle that is statutorily allowed to
 
03:39:43.229 --> 03:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
be 96 DB and of course as we know with
 
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
Automobiles and kill switches and
 
03:39:47.990 --> 03:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
aftermarket mufflers and all that can be
 
03:39:52.269 --> 03:39:52.279 align:start position:0%
far higher than that okay
 
03:39:56.710 --> 03:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
so there's there's no way for the O RV
 
03:40:00.150 --> 03:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
drivers to obtain the consent of or to
 
03:40:01.950 --> 03:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
offer compensation to the people they're
 
03:40:03.550 --> 03:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
harming and I'm just talking about the
 
03:40:04.950 --> 03:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
noise because that's the easiest one to
 
03:40:06.389 --> 03:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
talk about there are I'm sure other
 
03:40:10.309 --> 03:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
negative externalities so how how should
 
03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
legislators weigh these competing
 
03:40:14.590 --> 03:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
interests well a guy named maner Olson
 
03:40:17.070 --> 03:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
wrote a book called um logic of
 
03:40:19.950 --> 03:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
collective action and he made an
 
03:40:22.189 --> 03:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
important point which is that if you
 
03:40:26.309 --> 03:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
have a a concentrated group of winners
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
against a large but smaller uh more
 
03:40:32.590 --> 03:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
diffuse losers the small group of
 
03:40:35.510 --> 03:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
winners is likely to win in in in
 
03:40:37.349 --> 03:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
politics because they're going to have
 
03:40:39.990 --> 03:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
the incentive to devote a lot of their
 
03:40:41.630 --> 03:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
resources to lobbying so that's
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
basically why we have billions a year
 
03:40:47.189 --> 03:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
spent on biof fuel subsidies even though
 
03:40:48.950 --> 03:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
no Economist
 
03:40:51.429 --> 03:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
agricultural farmer everyone knows it's
 
03:40:55.189 --> 03:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
a scam but it persists because the Iowa
 
03:40:58.630 --> 03:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
Corn Farmers have the presidential what
 
03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
was it caucus to demand that sorry I'm
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
going to have to interrupt you again
 
03:41:06.750 --> 03:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the chickens and the
 
03:41:09.590 --> 03:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
Iowa just get to the Bill thank here we
 
03:41:13.710 --> 03:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
are so the bill cannot be whether it's
 
03:41:15.790 --> 03:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
good or bad policy cannot be Jud by how
 
03:41:17.790 --> 03:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
many people support it or don't support
 
03:41:21.189 --> 03:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
it because the people who support it are
 
03:41:23.429 --> 03:41:23.439 align:start position:0%
getting to going to do their favorite
 
03:41:25.830 --> 03:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
thing in life or maybe second I don't
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
know you know their favorite more at at
 
03:41:33.070 --> 03:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
someone else's expense whereas all the
 
03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
people are going to hear a vehicle every
 
03:41:36.469 --> 03:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
five minutes every 10 minutes depending
 
03:41:38.590 --> 03:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
on where you live they're going to lose
 
03:41:40.189 --> 03:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
just a little and they probably don't
 
03:41:42.269 --> 03:41:42.279 align:start position:0%
even know about this law but I assure
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
you every ohrv Club in New Hampshire
 
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
knows about this law La so that's the
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay leaving aside these general
 
03:41:50.349 --> 03:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
principles just a couple practical
 
03:41:53.510 --> 03:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
issues as I said they there's a 96 deel
 
03:41:54.750 --> 03:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
limit on
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
ohvs but uh that's pretty loud to begin
 
03:42:00.149 --> 03:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
with but we all know that engines can be
 
03:42:02.229 --> 03:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
tuned and driven a certain way they're
 
03:42:03.990 --> 03:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot louder than that and
 
03:42:05.870 --> 03:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
there are no annual inspections and even
 
03:42:07.990 --> 03:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
on automobiles which do have annual
 
03:42:10.670 --> 03:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
inspections at least where I live
 
03:42:12.790 --> 03:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
there's no limit to the number of people
 
03:42:15.389 --> 03:42:15.399 align:start position:0%
with their tuned Audi's or Hondas want
 
03:42:17.630 --> 03:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
to tell me on Friday night or Saturday
 
03:42:19.990 --> 03:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
night that they can easily go over 100
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
dbel as they accelerate past my house
 
03:42:24.590 --> 03:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I've talked to police about this
 
03:42:26.830 --> 03:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
most towns do not have a deciel meter
 
03:42:28.349 --> 03:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
which by the way takes two police
 
03:42:30.469 --> 03:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
officers with certification to operate
 
03:42:33.149 --> 03:42:33.159 align:start position:0%
it and all that so it's much harder to
 
03:42:35.590 --> 03:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
enforce in speed and we're not enforcing
 
03:42:37.110 --> 03:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
it for cars at least where I live I
 
03:42:38.750 --> 03:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
don't know about where you live cars or
 
03:42:41.790 --> 03:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
trucks and and I don't see how we're
 
03:42:44.070 --> 03:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
ever going to enforce it for ohvs
 
03:42:46.750 --> 03:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
secondly um the law talks about
 
03:42:48.630 --> 03:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
obtaining the permission of a Butters
 
03:42:50.990 --> 03:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
now the notion of a Butters makes sense
 
03:42:52.510 --> 03:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about putting a up a
 
03:42:54.469 --> 03:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
fence like it can't be too ugly for your
 
03:42:56.309 --> 03:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
neighbors but if you're giving
 
03:42:58.710 --> 03:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
permission for someone to ride vehicles
 
03:43:01.389 --> 03:43:01.399 align:start position:0%
that could be 100 DB on your property
 
03:43:03.750 --> 03:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
really the relevant range should be
 
03:43:05.670 --> 03:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
anyone who can hear it and that's
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
frequently going to be way more than one
 
03:43:08.910 --> 03:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
property width unless you're living in
 
03:43:12.910 --> 03:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
an area with like 50 acres zoning so um
 
03:43:14.750 --> 03:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know I mean ultimately the
 
03:43:16.750 --> 03:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
question and it's it's unfortunate but
 
03:43:18.590 --> 03:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
some hobbies are just more annoying than
 
03:43:20.750 --> 03:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
others can you draw you ask for three
 
03:43:23.110 --> 03:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
minutes and my clerk tells me you've way
 
03:43:25.870 --> 03:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
gone beyond three minutes so so the
 
03:43:28.189 --> 03:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
basic question is does Live Free or Die
 
03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
mean that people are free to do what
 
03:43:31.349 --> 03:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
they want regardless of the harm to
 
03:43:34.110 --> 03:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
others or does it mean that residents
 
03:43:36.790 --> 03:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
are free to enjoy the quiet enjoyment of
 
03:43:38.790 --> 03:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
their homes without a very good reason
 
03:43:42.469 --> 03:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
like a a a fire ambulance or a truck
 
03:43:45.469 --> 03:43:45.479 align:start position:0%
delivering needed supplies and just as
 
03:43:47.070 --> 03:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
for the second speaker the second
 
03:43:50.030 --> 03:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
speaker is explicitly arguing that the
 
03:43:51.910 --> 03:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
government should somehow
 
03:43:55.309 --> 03:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
subsidize uh new permitting for ohvs now
 
03:43:56.910 --> 03:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
the government generally subsidizes
 
03:43:58.550 --> 03:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
things that have positive externalities
 
03:44:00.750 --> 03:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
we pay for K through 12 schooling so
 
03:44:02.269 --> 03:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
people will be able to get a job and not
 
03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
become criminals we pay for public
 
03:44:06.110 --> 03:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
vaccination because that's thought to
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
provide health benefits but why would
 
03:44:10.510 --> 03:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
the government subsidize something that
 
03:44:12.790 --> 03:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
has basically negative externalities it
 
03:44:15.870 --> 03:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
just doesn't make any sense um and I
 
03:44:17.870 --> 03:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
think that's about it but thank you for
 
03:44:21.189 --> 03:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
your time any questions any questions
 
03:44:23.110 --> 03:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your test one
 
03:44:25.630 --> 03:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
final thing climate change is obviously
 
03:44:27.630 --> 03:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
the mother of all negative externalities
 
03:44:31.189 --> 03:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
and it has to be uh acted on by pricing
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
carbon thank you thank
 
03:44:36.630 --> 03:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
you speaking against it uh Captain
 
03:44:38.950 --> 03:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
Eastman from New Hampshire fishing game
 
03:44:38.960 --> 03:44:41.429 align:start position:0%
Eastman from New Hampshire fishing game
Captain

03:44:41.429 --> 03:44:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
Eastman thank you Mr chair and committee
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
um I am here here are the behest of the
 
03:44:48.870 --> 03:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh fishing game committee and uh they
 
03:44:51.269 --> 03:44:51.279 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this bill um they opposed
 
03:44:53.550 --> 03:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
for several reasons I can certainly go
 
03:44:57.670 --> 03:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
over those um I've been o rvy
 
03:45:00.429 --> 03:45:00.439 align:start position:0%
coordinator uh for going on six years
 
03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
and in those almost six years we have
 
03:45:07.790 --> 03:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
worked to uh get ohvs off the road um
 
03:45:11.550 --> 03:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
for instance uh just a couple years ago
 
03:45:14.550 --> 03:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
passed a bill that if a ohrv was
 
03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
registered for the road um it could not
 
03:45:19.269 --> 03:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
register as a recreational vehicle and
 
03:45:23.149 --> 03:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
this was really to um thwart the Montana
 
03:45:25.790 --> 03:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
plate issue for which someone could ride
 
03:45:27.429 --> 03:45:27.439 align:start position:0%
on any road
 
03:45:31.030 --> 03:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
unregulated um and uh would really put a
 
03:45:34.830 --> 03:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
black eye on the ohrv community so I'm
 
03:45:36.269 --> 03:45:36.279 align:start position:0%
not really speaking about the first part
 
03:45:39.070 --> 03:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
of this bill and uh and notifying the
 
03:45:41.550 --> 03:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
abutters I'll leave that to Chief reny
 
03:45:45.070 --> 03:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
to speak to um I guess my biggest
 
03:45:47.229 --> 03:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
question about this bill and expanding
 
03:45:51.950 --> 03:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
ohrv use on highways is that
 
03:45:54.309 --> 03:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
um in my six years one of the biggest
 
03:45:55.870 --> 03:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
complaints especially when I came in
 
03:46:00.389 --> 03:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
here uh was uh Road usage of
 
03:46:03.710 --> 03:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
ohvs um I I think to say that it's been
 
03:46:06.710 --> 03:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
successful in Coos County is uh is is
 
03:46:09.670 --> 03:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
not true uh the town of dummer decided
 
03:46:12.389 --> 03:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
within my time to close their roads due
 
03:46:15.269 --> 03:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
to the complaints um of their res
 
03:46:19.830 --> 03:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
residents um and once again just just a
 
03:46:21.670 --> 03:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago we were here speaking
 
03:46:25.590 --> 03:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
about how uh depressed um the Coos
 
03:46:29.790 --> 03:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
County uh is and how uh ohrv use in that
 
03:46:32.990 --> 03:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
county uh brings in so much revenue to
 
03:46:36.710 --> 03:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
them um that we uh needed to open up 10
 
03:46:40.269 --> 03:46:40.279 align:start position:0%
a half miles of the headwaters property
 
03:46:41.630 --> 03:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh for use of
 
03:46:45.910 --> 03:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
ohvs um but now two weeks later
 
03:46:47.790 --> 03:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
there's enough to go around to every
 
03:46:49.510 --> 03:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
other County and we should open up those
 
03:46:52.349 --> 03:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
counties I just don't understand that if
 
03:46:55.550 --> 03:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
um if this is really helping Coos County
 
03:46:57.990 --> 03:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
then why is it not helping it out or why
 
03:47:00.189 --> 03:47:00.199 align:start position:0%
are we introducing a bill that would
 
03:47:02.590 --> 03:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
take or deter or take money away from
 
03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
that County um and I I think that's just
 
03:47:08.590 --> 03:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
one question that you may not hear um so
 
03:47:10.950 --> 03:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
I think the long and short of it is is
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
that uh this uh This original law was
 
03:47:17.830 --> 03:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
was part of ride the Wilds ride the
 
03:47:22.870 --> 03:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
Wilds um in my opinion uh was was thrust
 
03:47:26.149 --> 03:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
upon uh the state uh without uh a whole
 
03:47:28.830 --> 03:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
lot of planning and I think that uh we
 
03:47:30.349 --> 03:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
don't want to make that same mistake
 
03:47:34.950 --> 03:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
again um the HB 1188 ohrv commission
 
03:47:38.149 --> 03:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
really was established to look at issues
 
03:47:41.670 --> 03:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
like this and come up with Solutions um
 
03:47:41.680 --> 03:47:43.389 align:start position:0%
like this and come up with Solutions um
so

03:47:43.389 --> 03:47:43.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:46.309 --> 03:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
um to finish up here that's really why
 
03:47:48.269 --> 03:47:48.279 align:start position:0%
the fishing Game Commission is opposed
 
03:47:52.269 --> 03:47:52.279 align:start position:0%
to this uh this Bill thank you Captain
 
03:47:55.229 --> 03:47:55.239 align:start position:0%
questions representative Darby thank you
 
03:47:57.070 --> 03:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh thank you Captain Ean for
 
03:47:59.030 --> 03:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question based on your
 
03:48:01.229 --> 03:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
experience if the state roads were
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
opened up um to be connectors between
 
03:48:09.910 --> 03:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
increase I can't say that it would
 
03:48:16.229 --> 03:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
increase um I can say that um if it came
 
03:48:19.149 --> 03:48:19.159 align:start position:0%
down to um someone who was looking to
 
03:48:20.670 --> 03:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire to operate an O
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
HRV and they had the choice of going to
 
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
Marram County if they were coming from
 
03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts let's say and ride in that
 
03:48:30.630 --> 03:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
area as opposed to going all the way to
 
03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
Coos County that's I think where you're
 
03:48:34.590 --> 03:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
going to see the difference is that
 
03:48:37.349 --> 03:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to move from those other
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
counties that are currently open to um
 
03:48:42.870 --> 03:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know to those lower counties says
 
03:48:44.269 --> 03:48:44.279 align:start position:0%
why would you drive another hour and a
 
03:48:46.269 --> 03:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
half if you can get the same bang for
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
your buck in the lower
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
counties any other questions for Captain
 
03:48:54.229 --> 03:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
Eastman seeing none thank you Captain or
 
03:48:56.510 --> 03:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
did you have a
 
03:48:58.910 --> 03:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
question so you're all set with Captain
 
03:49:00.429 --> 03:49:00.439 align:start position:0%

03:49:02.750 --> 03:49:02.760 align:start position:0%

03:49:04.870 --> 03:49:04.880 align:start position:0%

03:49:06.149 --> 03:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I was just wondering if
 
03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
someone from dot is here today that is
 
03:49:10.950 --> 03:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
we have someone from do that says they
 
03:49:13.110 --> 03:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
will ask question they will respond to
 
03:49:15.269 --> 03:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
questions if there's only if there is
 
03:49:18.189 --> 03:49:18.199 align:start position:0%
any questions so as chair I've kept this
 
03:49:19.910 --> 03:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
card out here cuz I thought would' hear
 
03:49:22.389 --> 03:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
the testimony of the other people first
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
and then we'll ask the board if they
 
03:49:27.870 --> 03:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
have any questions of do if you don't
 
03:49:30.870 --> 03:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
have any questions and it's not going to
 
03:49:34.830 --> 03:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
testify good question though thank you
 
03:49:36.590 --> 03:49:36.600 align:start position:0%

03:49:40.990 --> 03:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
opposed uh Abby IA from gorum
 
03:49:46.750 --> 03:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:49.710 --> 03:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
and my clerk was very interested in this
 
03:49:51.590 --> 03:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
but you might ask and watch how come the
 
03:49:54.189 --> 03:49:54.199 align:start position:0%
clerk left because he's uh bringing a
 
03:49:56.550 --> 03:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
bill at another session so he's got to

03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
vano uh from gorhum today I'm speaking
 
03:50:06.630 --> 03:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
to you as a private citizen who knows
 
03:50:08.309 --> 03:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
too many friends and neighbors across
 
03:50:10.070 --> 03:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who've lost the peace and
 
03:50:11.750 --> 03:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
quiet of their homes to the noise and
 
03:50:15.149 --> 03:50:15.159 align:start position:0%
dust of misplaced ohrv trails I would
 
03:50:17.710 --> 03:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
say that the process leaves a Butters
 
03:50:20.070 --> 03:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
out of the process and it it leaves a
 
03:50:22.189 --> 03:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
Butters of state roads out of the
 
03:50:23.830 --> 03:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
process right now there is no
 
03:50:25.830 --> 03:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
notification if you live along a state
 
03:50:28.030 --> 03:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
road if it's going to be opened up to
 
03:50:30.469 --> 03:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
ohvs yes there's a public hearing but if
 
03:50:32.670 --> 03:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
you live there you do not get anything
 
03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
telling you that your road might be an
 
03:50:37.030 --> 03:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
ATV trail you just have you have to see
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
the little box in the back of the paper
 
03:50:40.510 --> 03:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
which might
 
03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
have if you even have a paper so um
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
state roads those citizens do not get a
 
03:50:46.800 --> 03:50:47.710 align:start position:0%
state roads those citizens do not get a
butter

03:50:47.710 --> 03:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
butter
 
03:50:50.309 --> 03:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
notification uh unfortunately the way
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
ride the Wilds rolled out without any a
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
butter notification to town or state
 
03:50:57.309 --> 03:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
roads success for Riders has meant
 
03:51:00.389 --> 03:51:00.399 align:start position:0%
losses for residents be this process has
 
03:51:04.030 --> 03:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
not served residents um once a road is
 
03:51:06.309 --> 03:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
open it's not open to just a few
 
03:51:08.510 --> 03:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
residents it's open to anyone who shows
 
03:51:12.910 --> 03:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
up that's a very important um unintended
 
03:51:15.790 --> 03:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
consequence um the problem and Coos have
 
03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
not been solved um the people there are
 
03:51:20.349 --> 03:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
still waiting for their peace and quiet
 
03:51:25.110 --> 03:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
to be returned um as former chairman of
 
03:51:27.750 --> 03:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
this committee Andy Rulo likes to say a
 
03:51:29.349 --> 03:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
family's home is their castle and it
 
03:51:33.630 --> 03:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
must be defended HB 683 is a property
 
03:51:35.469 --> 03:51:35.479 align:start position:0%
rights issue people have the right to
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
the peaceful enjoyment of their property
 
03:51:38.990 --> 03:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
and they have the right to know if a
 
03:51:41.149 --> 03:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
significant change in use is proposed at
 
03:51:42.710 --> 03:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
their property
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
line um to end
 
03:51:46.469 --> 03:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
petition or payment of butter
 
03:51:49.750 --> 03:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
notification makes no sense who will pay
 
03:51:51.550 --> 03:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
this sounds like an attempt to undermine
 
03:51:53.590 --> 03:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
the abutter notification when it needs
 
03:51:55.510 --> 03:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
to be strengthened to include those on
 
03:51:57.910 --> 03:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
state roads the abutter notification was
 
03:52:00.389 --> 03:52:00.399 align:start position:0%
passed I think in 2019 after Coos
 
03:52:02.070 --> 03:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
residents came and complained that was
 
03:52:03.710 --> 03:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
the one protection they were able to
 
03:52:06.389 --> 03:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
pass going forward they haven't regained
 
03:52:09.309 --> 03:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
their peace and quiet they still they
 
03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
cannot open their windows in the
 
03:52:13.950 --> 03:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
summer they can't put out they stop
 
03:52:15.630 --> 03:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
putting out the their lawn and patio
 
03:52:17.550 --> 03:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
furniture they've stopped inviting
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
family and friends over for summer and
 
03:52:21.790 --> 03:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
barbecues and they make plans to leave
 
03:52:23.550 --> 03:52:23.560 align:start position:0%
their homes on weekends to escape the
 
03:52:26.030 --> 03:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
noise dust and fumes of ATVs that have
 
03:52:27.910 --> 03:52:27.920 align:start position:0%

study commission and and is our
 
03:54:11.510 --> 03:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative on that body I'm not
 
03:54:13.630 --> 03:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
going to read the letters but I just
 
03:54:15.269 --> 03:54:15.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a couple
 
03:54:19.710 --> 03:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
uh short points um so first we do
 
03:54:22.870 --> 03:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
understand that you know some view ohvs
 
03:54:25.110 --> 03:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
as you know important to the economy
 
03:54:28.710 --> 03:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
especially up in Coos but you know as
 
03:54:30.269 --> 03:54:30.279 align:start position:0%
you've heard
 
03:54:32.790 --> 03:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
from some of the prior speakers that
 
03:54:36.550 --> 03:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
view is is is not shared I mean there is
 
03:54:39.790 --> 03:54:39.800 align:start position:0%
ongoing conflict and concerns by
 
03:54:42.710 --> 03:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
Property Owners um abutters to the
 
03:54:45.590 --> 03:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
trails and so our concern with the bill
 
03:54:48.830 --> 03:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
is that and and we do view the bill as
 
03:54:52.830 --> 03:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
an expansion of the um o system in New
 
03:54:54.830 --> 03:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we're doing that at a time
 
03:54:57.590 --> 03:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
when we have not come to a consensus on
 
03:55:00.630 --> 03:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
how to manage the trail and how to you
 
03:55:03.269 --> 03:55:03.279 align:start position:0%
know balance the good points and the bad
 
03:55:07.750 --> 03:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
points um from this so you know uh
 
03:55:10.229 --> 03:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
several speakers have mentioned the um
 
03:55:12.990 --> 03:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
this OAB study commission and you know
 
03:55:16.030 --> 03:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
our three organizations did support the
 
03:55:18.750 --> 03:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
creation of that commission and it was
 
03:55:21.070 --> 03:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
done really with the expectation that
 
03:55:22.349 --> 03:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
the commission would be sort of the
 
03:55:25.630 --> 03:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
starting point to sift through all the
 
03:55:28.510 --> 03:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
issues um that are that are happening
 
03:55:31.950 --> 03:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
now um so you know I think you know we
 
03:55:34.429 --> 03:55:34.439 align:start position:0%
would encourage the committee to either
 
03:55:38.269 --> 03:55:38.279 align:start position:0%
um vote this bill itl or to maybe retain
 
03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
it and have this the um
 
03:55:45.309 --> 03:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
commission really look at the intent and
 
03:55:48.070 --> 03:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
issues um with the bill and and you know
 
03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
really try to sus out the benefits and
 
03:55:54.550 --> 03:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
impacts before passage so with that I
 
03:55:56.550 --> 03:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
will close thank you thank you for your
 
03:55:58.670 --> 03:55:58.680 align:start position:0%

Sierra Club uh I represent about 11,000
 
03:56:24.990 --> 03:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
members and supporters in the
 
03:56:30.910 --> 03:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
state and uh we to oppose this bill
 
03:56:36.110 --> 03:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
um for uh the first section um removing
 
03:56:40.229 --> 03:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
the petitioner as the um
 
03:56:43.870 --> 03:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
Financial um uh the person responsible
 
03:56:43.880 --> 03:56:44.950 align:start position:0%
Financial um uh the person responsible
for

03:56:44.950 --> 03:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:56:47.870 --> 03:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
notification um it without
 
03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
replacing um someone uh is very reckless
 
03:56:54.950 --> 03:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
in our view
 
03:56:58.189 --> 03:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
um petitioners uh whether they are a
 
03:56:59.870 --> 03:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
club or an
 
03:57:02.510 --> 03:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
individual um are the ones who are
 
03:57:06.710 --> 03:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
bringing forth this proposal and um it
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
seems very reasonable that they would be
 
03:57:11.349 --> 03:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
03:57:14.710 --> 03:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
notification um that's how um
 
03:57:18.349 --> 03:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
our experience has been in other uh
 
03:57:18.359 --> 03:57:20.189 align:start position:0%
our experience has been in other uh
petitioning

03:57:20.189 --> 03:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
petitioning
 
03:57:24.229 --> 03:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
situations um we also see this as a cost
 
03:57:28.389 --> 03:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
shift from the user to the
 
03:57:32.309 --> 03:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
community um the community is not
 
03:57:34.950 --> 03:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily um the ones involved in the
 
03:57:38.910 --> 03:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
activity I think about like a a
 
03:57:41.830 --> 03:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
driveway and when someone goes to the
 
03:57:45.309 --> 03:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
town they are responsible for their
 
03:57:47.870 --> 03:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
driveway and they're responsible to
 
03:57:51.429 --> 03:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
notify their neighbors um this is a very
 
03:57:54.269 --> 03:57:54.279 align:start position:0%
similar kind of use the petitioner
 
03:57:56.990 --> 03:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
should be the one responsible for
 
03:58:00.990 --> 03:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
notifying everyone along that roadway of
 
03:58:03.550 --> 03:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
this major change of
 
03:58:10.149 --> 03:58:10.159 align:start position:0%
use um secondly um this the uh
 
03:58:14.510 --> 03:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
expansion of ATVs on state roads oh um
 
03:58:16.910 --> 03:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
and sorry about
 
03:58:19.710 --> 03:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
notification I uh want to emphasize what
 
03:58:23.950 --> 03:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
we just heard from Abby evow that state
 
03:58:28.269 --> 03:58:28.279 align:start position:0%
roads um or town roads do not have
 
03:58:28.279 --> 03:58:30.070 align:start position:0%
roads um or town roads do not have
notification

03:58:30.070 --> 03:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
notification
 
03:58:30.080 --> 03:58:31.630 align:start position:0%
notification
now

03:58:31.630 --> 03:58:31.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
um this is I may have gotten that wrong
 
03:58:39.790 --> 03:58:39.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh but uh to only the the
 
03:58:42.670 --> 03:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
point that only certain roads get
 
03:58:42.680 --> 03:58:44.349 align:start position:0%
point that only certain roads get
notification

03:58:44.349 --> 03:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
notification
 
03:58:47.389 --> 03:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
that's not um we don't see that as a
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
fair application of notifying people
 
03:58:54.189 --> 03:58:54.199 align:start position:0%
Everyone um all of the abuts on state
 
03:58:57.149 --> 03:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
roads and town roads should be notified
 
03:59:01.149 --> 03:59:01.159 align:start position:0%
that's our position um secondly
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
expanding um the in into the five other
 
03:59:08.910 --> 03:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
Comm counties um I don't think it's ripe
 
03:59:11.309 --> 03:59:11.319 align:start position:0%
at this time we have a commission we've
 
03:59:15.030 --> 03:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
heard um about the commission
 
03:59:17.910 --> 03:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
they are I liked what Mr Ley called
 
03:59:20.149 --> 03:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
they're the starting point for this
 
03:59:23.710 --> 03:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
discussion and um we're waiting for them
 
03:59:27.149 --> 03:59:27.159 align:start position:0%

concerns meeting minutes reflect that
 
04:02:09.870 --> 04:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
the board was still leaning towards
 
04:02:12.349 --> 04:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
adopting The Proposal but wanted
 
04:02:14.910 --> 04:02:14.920 align:start position:0%

challenges of ATV enforcement with very
 
04:02:45.550 --> 04:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
limited resources ources and what the
 
04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
responsibilities the town would incur by
 
04:02:52.670 --> 04:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
allowing ATV use on the roads minutes
 
04:02:55.710 --> 04:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
from this meeting this is all in public
 
04:02:59.070 --> 04:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
record uh reflect the following while
 
04:03:00.670 --> 04:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
the board has been leaning toward
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
supporting the request to let the club
 
04:03:07.469 --> 04:03:07.479 align:start position:0%
adopt the roads after the feedback and
 
04:03:09.870 --> 04:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
additional information presented
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately the board decided against
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
approving the at the club's
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
request removing petitioner payment for
 
04:03:20.309 --> 04:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
a butter
 
04:03:23.349 --> 04:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
notification significantly increases the
 
04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
risk that notification will not occur as
 
04:03:29.429 --> 04:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
noted above allowing the community to
 
04:03:31.750 --> 04:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
voice their perspective in select board
 
04:03:35.189 --> 04:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
decisions can change the outcome
 
04:03:37.389 --> 04:03:37.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it appears that the intent
 
04:03:40.030 --> 04:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to limit Community
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
involvement when ATV expansion is being
 
04:03:43.319 --> 04:03:44.710 align:start position:0%
involvement when ATV expansion is being
proposed

04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
04:03:48.149 --> 04:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
we believe this is unfair and we ask for
 
04:03:50.710 --> 04:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
your help in defeating this Bill thank
 
04:03:52.469 --> 04:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
you Barber did you want to say anything
 
04:03:55.030 --> 04:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:58.389 --> 04:03:58.399 align:start position:0%
just agree with you I just want to say I
 
04:04:00.630 --> 04:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
it it really
 
04:04:04.349 --> 04:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
is not very nice to live in a place
 
04:04:07.030 --> 04:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
where ATVs are going by every every
 
04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes sometimes there's like
 
04:04:11.389 --> 04:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
50 of them at a maybe not 50 it feels
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
like 50 15 of them at a time going by
 
04:04:17.070 --> 04:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
and you know we have our grandchildren
 
04:04:20.469 --> 04:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
live with us and yeah it's just not you
 
04:04:23.389 --> 04:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
know there's pollution there's
 
04:04:25.229 --> 04:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
noise sometimes there's a lot of
 
04:04:29.030 --> 04:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
shouting and it's just really does
 
04:04:31.710 --> 04:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
disturb your quality of life for
 
04:04:34.429 --> 04:04:34.439 align:start position:0%

04:04:36.990 --> 04:04:37.000 align:start position:0%

atbs on these roads any questions for
 
04:04:44.229 --> 04:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
the speakers sing none thank you very
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
much and my last card in opposition
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
Jason stock New Hampshire Timberland
 
04:05:00.870 --> 04:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:03.429 --> 04:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
stock well well good afternoon and it
 
04:05:05.349 --> 04:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
has been a long afternoon so I'll try to
 
04:05:08.269 --> 04:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
be brief and I just wanted to touch on
 
04:05:12.429 --> 04:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
four points that um came out as I sat
 
04:05:14.189 --> 04:05:14.199 align:start position:0%
here with you in this hearing
 
04:05:16.149 --> 04:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
the sponsor introduced this bill as a
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
process Bill and and I want want to
 
04:05:21.710 --> 04:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
raise that because you've heard process
 
04:05:23.830 --> 04:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple times several times
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
throughout this hearing the process of
 
04:05:30.550 --> 04:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
notifying a Butters state roads do not
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
require a butter
 
04:05:35.070 --> 04:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
notification that process that class
 
04:05:37.149 --> 04:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
four five and six roads do in fact
 
04:05:39.790 --> 04:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
require a but a butter notification
 
04:05:41.550 --> 04:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
state roads do
 
04:05:45.429 --> 04:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
not also proc process who's who's on the
 
04:05:46.750 --> 04:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
hook for the
 
04:05:49.189 --> 04:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
notification that the notification we
 
04:05:51.309 --> 04:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
can only assume because it's no longer
 
04:05:53.910 --> 04:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
referenced in the bill that it falls to
 
04:05:57.229 --> 04:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
the municipality but it would be nice to
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
have that defined is as as lawmakers you
 
04:06:04.030 --> 04:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
folks like to tune things in and make it
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
clear who's on the who's responsible for
 
04:06:08.750 --> 04:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
what who's who's on the hook for what
 
04:06:12.149 --> 04:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
cost so I would strongly urge you to
 
04:06:15.110 --> 04:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
consider including in this that it is in
 
04:06:18.149 --> 04:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
fact that is in fact if that is in fact
 
04:06:20.070 --> 04:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
the case in the will of this this
 
04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
committee include the includeed as the
 
04:06:24.670 --> 04:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities I think it's important to
 
04:06:25.750 --> 04:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
have that
 
04:06:29.110 --> 04:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
defined um you heard about you heard
 
04:06:30.590 --> 04:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
about enforcement I'm not going to
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
belabor that the last piece is process
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
and you know similar to my testimony on
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 174 which is the 3500 lb
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
was the 3500 lb uh o V limit getting uh
 
04:06:47.469 --> 04:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
weight limit getting increased House
 
04:06:47.479 --> 04:06:48.269 align:start position:0%
weight limit getting increased House
Bill

04:06:48.269 --> 04:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:06:51.750 --> 04:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
1188 there was a process established in
 
04:06:54.870 --> 04:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
htoa Farm Bureau and as you heard others
 
04:06:57.389 --> 04:06:57.399 align:start position:0%
have invested time money we've asked
 
04:07:00.389 --> 04:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
members and and others to invest time
 
04:07:03.870 --> 04:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
and time and effort into participating
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
in that process this bill Sid steps that
 
04:07:11.429 --> 04:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
process I think Mr ley's suggestion that
 
04:07:13.630 --> 04:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
this get retained
 
04:07:16.990 --> 04:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
and allow that commission to chew on it
 
04:07:19.710 --> 04:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
decide how to proceed would be
 
04:07:21.910 --> 04:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate with that I'll conclude my
 
04:07:24.309 --> 04:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
testimony it's been a long afternoon and
 
04:07:25.750 --> 04:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to belabor what you've
 
04:07:30.030 --> 04:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
already heard today but for us we do we
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
do speak in opposition to the bill as
 
04:07:34.109 --> 04:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
proposed for those very reasons and I'm
 
04:07:36.309 --> 04:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
happy to try and answer any questions
 
04:07:36.319 --> 04:07:37.510 align:start position:0%

for the question you have any idea the
 
04:08:10.870 --> 04:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
approximate maximum safe operating speed
 
04:08:14.630 --> 04:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
for an off Highway Recreation
 
04:08:17.309 --> 04:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh no I would not be the one for
 
04:08:20.510 --> 04:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
that um they are intended for off
 
04:08:25.349 --> 04:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
Highway recreational use so uh but
 
04:08:28.630 --> 04:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
um naby tires on pavement I'm not sure
 
04:08:30.990 --> 04:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
how the performance
 
04:08:34.030 --> 04:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
is does anyone else have a
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
question we'll go to representative NAD
 
04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair since I dragged you
 
04:08:41.229 --> 04:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
up here um we we received a lot of
 
04:08:42.670 --> 04:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
emails about this bill and a lot of them
 
04:08:44.990 --> 04:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
mention the impact on roads from having
 
04:08:48.309 --> 04:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
ATVs orvs on the roads can you speak to
 
04:08:51.149 --> 04:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
the impact is it different than a normal
 
04:08:53.510 --> 04:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle the impact that we would see
 
04:08:55.469 --> 04:08:55.479 align:start position:0%
would be on the the side slopes and
 
04:08:58.109 --> 04:08:58.119 align:start position:0%
gravel shoulders okay um not on the
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
paved surface itself but the uh the
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
erosion on the sides because it's not
 
04:09:07.030 --> 04:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
frozen like it is during Snowville use
 
04:09:09.030 --> 04:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
you I see another hand on my right
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
any other
 
04:09:18.189 --> 04:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
questions no thank you Mr hansam is
 
04:09:19.710 --> 04:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
there anyone else that wants to speak on
 
04:09:22.550 --> 04:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 683 I'll ask one more time
 
04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:09:27.030 --> 04:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
want Mr wilky you've already spoke for
 
04:09:29.830 --> 04:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
more than 10 minutes I know
 
04:09:34.990 --> 04:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:37.510 --> 04:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
minutes I'll give you 20 seconds because
 
04:09:40.469 --> 04:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
you had more than 10 minutes before and
 
04:09:41.790 --> 04:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
I think we can guess what you're going
 
04:09:43.950 --> 04:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
to say but I don't know
 
04:09:46.750 --> 04:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities are eligible for grant
 
04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
and aid so any maintenance on Class 5
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
roads that are dirt they can submit for
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
gravel for grading um or calcium
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
chloride for dust control safety on the
 
04:10:02.030 --> 04:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
state roads the permitting process has
 
04:10:03.950 --> 04:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
to go through the department of safety
 
04:10:06.389 --> 04:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
so they will look for safety concerns if
 
04:10:08.510 --> 04:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
there are safety concerns that would not
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
happen the law says up to 40 mph roads
 
04:10:16.429 --> 04:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
specom plates and these machines can
 
04:10:19.550 --> 04:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
operate on that is in fishing game rules
 
04:10:23.109 --> 04:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
so we take it as 40 mes an hour and up
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
is unsafe off highway vehicle was
 
04:10:30.030 --> 04:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
originally designed as highways which
 
04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
are elevated high-speed highways these
 
04:10:37.109 --> 04:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
are not safe on that regular roads they
 
04:10:40.269 --> 04:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
are okay and safe and manufacturers have
 
04:10:43.349 --> 04:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
stopped saying these are not safe on
 
04:10:46.590 --> 04:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
roads they're just not safe on highways
 
04:10:49.309 --> 04:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire once again has gone Far
 
04:10:51.670 --> 04:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
and Beyond and called every road a
 
04:10:54.790 --> 04:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
highway even the class six unmaintained
 
04:10:57.750 --> 04:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
roads are highways which is what are
 
04:11:02.189 --> 04:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
these are designed for so um appreciate
 
04:11:05.149 --> 04:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
that additional testimony thank you very
 
04:11:08.950 --> 04:11:08.960 align:start position:0%

04:11:37.790 --> 04:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
all for your time and patience I
 
04:11:40.349 --> 04:11:40.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and now we're moving on
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:49.070 --> 04:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
did he come back he came back here and I
 
04:11:52.269 --> 04:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
somebody go get representative Schmid
 
04:11:54.590 --> 04:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
what's his last name Schmid Schmid
 
04:11:57.630 --> 04:11:57.640 align:start position:0%
Schmidt so while we're waiting I'm going
 
04:12:03.630 --> 04:12:03.640 align:start position:0%
to call the 130 hearing on HB 691 FM
 
04:12:06.750 --> 04:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the addition of fluidization
 
04:12:09.590 --> 04:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
chemicals to Public Water Systems going
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
to open that hearing and the prime
 
04:12:13.630 --> 04:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor is across the hall he'll be
 
04:12:15.910 --> 04:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
right here
 
04:12:18.109 --> 04:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
um I have to remember to tell you
 
04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
something that I tell you
 
04:13:11.229 --> 04:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:11.239 --> 04:13:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
eyes

04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:42.670 --> 04:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
it's not speaking it's not speaking P
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:02.429 --> 04:15:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:39.070 --> 04:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:40.750 --> 04:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
so because we have a number of speakers
 
04:15:43.750 --> 04:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start this hearing on uh
 
04:15:47.590 --> 04:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
this bill HB 691 and the clerk will be
 
04:15:51.189 --> 04:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
back in a moment uh the prime sponsor
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you very much Mr chairman
 
04:16:00.429 --> 04:16:00.439 align:start position:0%
and uh everybody in the room and all the
 
04:16:03.309 --> 04:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
people whove been waiting outside your
 
04:16:05.870 --> 04:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
pension is in the
 
04:16:09.590 --> 04:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
mail but um thank you for sticking
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
around and I want to start off by saying
 
04:16:16.070 --> 04:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
that I am not some for the record
 
04:16:18.349 --> 04:16:18.359 align:start position:0%
represented Peter Schmidt representing
 
04:16:22.990 --> 04:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
do award one which is Stafford
 
04:16:26.070 --> 04:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
14 this is my 23rd year in the
 
04:16:28.910 --> 04:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and uh I'm not some Johnny
 
04:16:33.389 --> 04:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
come lately to the question of FL water
 
04:16:35.790 --> 04:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
fluoridation I first became somewhat
 
04:16:38.750 --> 04:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
aware of it probably about 60 years ago
 
04:16:41.429 --> 04:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
literally I read an article in Readers
 
04:16:43.910 --> 04:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
Digest that raised a bunch of the
 
04:16:47.149 --> 04:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
controversial issues about water flation
 
04:16:49.870 --> 04:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
and I said to myself someday I got to
 
04:16:52.349 --> 04:16:52.359 align:start position:0%
take a closer look at
 
04:16:55.389 --> 04:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
this uh 20 years ago I was on the
 
04:16:56.870 --> 04:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
municipal and County government
 
04:16:58.990 --> 04:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
committee and I was told there was a
 
04:17:01.950 --> 04:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
bill coming in to permit a new plebis
 
04:17:06.389 --> 04:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
site or referendum in Manchester because
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
they'd had one that had passed by about
 
04:17:14.590 --> 04:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
1% that involved the voters of
 
04:17:16.910 --> 04:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester but it didn't involve any of
 
04:17:19.229 --> 04:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
the collar communities which were also
 
04:17:21.990 --> 04:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
getting a lot of uh Manchester
 
04:17:26.070 --> 04:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
Waterworks water um and so they the
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
eventually there was a suit and and the
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
the court found that since they were
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
getting water and they didn't have a
 
04:17:35.149 --> 04:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
vote which the statute requires they had
 
04:17:36.630 --> 04:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
again so somebody said to me you're
 
04:17:41.830 --> 04:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
going to get the fluoride crazies in uh
 
04:17:43.389 --> 04:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
in your committee today on that
 
04:17:43.399 --> 04:17:45.109 align:start position:0%
in your committee today on that
Manchester

04:17:45.109 --> 04:17:45.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
04:17:48.030 --> 04:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
revote well when they came in I I heard
 
04:17:50.149 --> 04:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
all of them and I didn't hear anybody
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
that was crazy they had a lot of uh
 
04:17:55.109 --> 04:17:55.119 align:start position:0%
factual information scientific
 
04:17:57.550 --> 04:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
information and they all struck me as
 
04:17:57.560 --> 04:17:58.469 align:start position:0%
information and they all struck me as
very

04:17:58.469 --> 04:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:18:02.269 --> 04:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable um so in any case I and I
 
04:18:05.189 --> 04:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
have been troubled by some aspects of
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation ever since because I
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
did a lot of reading at that particular
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
time so this just to be clear this is
 
04:18:18.269 --> 04:18:18.279 align:start position:0%
not a bill about BL Banning fluoride
 
04:18:21.349 --> 04:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
because I recognize that if if you apply
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
fluoride to your teeth either with a uh
 
04:18:28.990 --> 04:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
ordinary fluoride toothpaste and uh uh
 
04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
and um a toothbrush and you're very
 
04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
careful that you don't swallow any of
 
04:18:36.070 --> 04:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
the stuff because says right on the tube
 
04:18:38.309 --> 04:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
right I couldn't hold the tube up if I
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
had it here because I'm not allowed to
 
04:18:44.469 --> 04:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
use prop but it's says right there be
 
04:18:47.070 --> 04:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
careful not to swallow any
 
04:18:50.590 --> 04:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
fluoride and if you do what does it say
 
04:18:53.469 --> 04:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
call your poison control center so
 
04:18:56.870 --> 04:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
fluoride is poison so is alcohol if you
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
drink enough alcohol you can kill
 
04:19:02.590 --> 04:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
yourself in a couple of hours um and and
 
04:19:05.870 --> 04:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
fluoride is poisoned but carefully used
 
04:19:07.389 --> 04:19:07.399 align:start position:0%
in the appropriate
 
04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
way there's no doubt in my mind that the
 
04:19:13.109 --> 04:19:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh that it will protect your your teeth
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
to some degree against carries or cavity
 
04:19:17.840 --> 04:19:19.550 align:start position:0%
to some degree against carries or cavity
tooth

04:19:19.550 --> 04:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
tooth
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
decay so this is not a build to kill
 
04:19:26.149 --> 04:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
fluide use at all used in that fashion
 
04:19:29.469 --> 04:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
topically directly applied it definitely
 
04:19:32.870 --> 04:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
works um the idea is that water
 
04:19:36.149 --> 04:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
fluoridation it's a is a is a different
 
04:19:38.070 --> 04:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
breed of
 
04:19:41.670 --> 04:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
cat so what what do what do why do I
 
04:19:44.269 --> 04:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
bring this bill again we've had numerous
 
04:19:47.710 --> 04:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
iterations over the years and for the
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
last couple of terms some version of a
 
04:19:54.510 --> 04:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
Flor water fluoridation ban has come
 
04:19:58.750 --> 04:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
forward but mostly it was a buil to
 
04:20:01.189 --> 04:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
study it because I do believe that there
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
are controversial aspects that need
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
further study but in the
 
04:20:08.030 --> 04:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
meantime there is a there has been a
 
04:20:12.030 --> 04:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
court case out in California I believe
 
04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
that r L with this issue for about 3
 
04:20:18.269 --> 04:20:18.279 align:start position:0%
years and that court case has been
 
04:20:21.870 --> 04:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
decided and the Court ruled that the EPA
 
04:20:25.189 --> 04:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
has got it set to work writing will uh
 
04:20:28.990 --> 04:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
rules to ban water
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
fluoridation That's the basis of this
 
04:20:34.389 --> 04:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
bill um I'm not going to argue the
 
04:20:36.309 --> 04:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
science because I'm not a scientist even
 
04:20:39.109 --> 04:20:39.119 align:start position:0%
though I read an awful lot about it but
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
there are number of people here today
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
that that are practitioners and in one
 
04:20:45.510 --> 04:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
form or another
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
of uh tooth uh protection but also of
 
04:20:55.030 --> 04:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
Health protection and the I will say
 
04:21:00.070 --> 04:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
that uh the court case did rule that
 
04:21:04.750 --> 04:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
that the consumption of floridated Water
 
04:21:06.030 --> 04:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
by pregnant
 
04:21:10.229 --> 04:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
women creates a situation where the
 
04:21:13.109 --> 04:21:13.119 align:start position:0%
fluid acts as a neurotoxin
 
04:21:16.990 --> 04:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
which clearly by by virtue of
 
04:21:21.189 --> 04:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
highquality EPA funded studies showed
 
04:21:26.229 --> 04:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
that it's a neurotoxin that lowers IQ in
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
of that developing Child In Utero and
 
04:21:32.790 --> 04:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
continues to harm the developing brain
 
04:21:35.070 --> 04:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
even after the child is born if the
 
04:21:38.149 --> 04:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
mother makes the formula with uh
 
04:21:40.870 --> 04:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
floridated water so I won't take any
 
04:21:42.269 --> 04:21:42.279 align:start position:0%
questions because I want you to hear
 
04:21:45.109 --> 04:21:45.119 align:start position:0%
from people who are experts not for me
 
04:21:47.830 --> 04:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
even if I'm right appreciate that
 
04:21:49.990 --> 04:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much uh
 
04:21:51.870 --> 04:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
just so that everybody knows we do have
 
04:21:53.550 --> 04:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
people here representing the New
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees and New Hampshire HHS
 
04:22:00.030 --> 04:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
Department of HHS I'm going to hold them
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
till last because we'd like the other
 
04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
speakers in the public to speak first
 
04:22:06.389 --> 04:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
but I wanted you to know they were here
 
04:22:08.030 --> 04:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
in case somebody had a question they
 
04:22:11.830 --> 04:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
might want to ask them thank you uh in
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:20.990 --> 04:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
palazov Mar thank you Mr chair for
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
the Y po representing May Mark 10 hookit
 
04:22:30.189 --> 04:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
and D Buton uh I I see on how health
 
04:22:32.189 --> 04:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
human services and elderly Affairs
 
04:22:34.990 --> 04:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
committee and as you heard this is not a
 
04:22:37.590 --> 04:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
new issue some study bills were
 
04:22:40.710 --> 04:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
suggested in the past uh unfortunately
 
04:22:42.990 --> 04:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
we were not allowed to study this isue
 
04:22:46.229 --> 04:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
lobbyist said it's safe and effective
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
just like this covid vaccine safe and
 
04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
effective but now we we have new data
 
04:22:53.830 --> 04:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
Federal data on
 
04:22:58.349 --> 04:22:58.359 align:start position:0%
neurotoxicity uh of uh these chemicals
 
04:23:01.830 --> 04:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
and it's unproportionately targeting po
 
04:23:04.710 --> 04:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
populations uh for example when my my
 
04:23:08.429 --> 04:23:08.439 align:start position:0%
wife was pregnant uh how many T unborn
 
04:23:13.469 --> 04:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
baby had zero but unborn baby had
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
brain neural cells that uh could be uh
 
04:23:23.309 --> 04:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
targeted by those chemicals uh with uh
 
04:23:27.030 --> 04:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh lower IQ and other uh bad
 
04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
consequences so uh I I was well off so I
 
04:23:33.429 --> 04:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
could buy a a water special water for my
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
pregnant wife so she wouldn't have to
 
04:23:36.479 --> 04:23:37.670 align:start position:0%
pregnant wife so she wouldn't have to
drink

04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
drink
 
04:23:41.269 --> 04:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
flated water but many of my constituents
 
04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
they don't have extra money money to pay
 
04:23:46.830 --> 04:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
for water so they targeted by this
 
04:23:46.840 --> 04:23:48.590 align:start position:0%
for water so they targeted by this
non-consensual

04:23:48.590 --> 04:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
non-consensual
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
medication uh it's uh uh nonpartisan
 
04:23:56.750 --> 04:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
issue like as far as I know some liberal
 
04:23:59.830 --> 04:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities like K they voted against
 
04:24:05.349 --> 04:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh this uh treatment long time ago uh
 
04:24:09.309 --> 04:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
one concern is chemical levels like when
 
04:24:14.429 --> 04:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
we talk about mar mar an issue with uh
 
04:24:14.439 --> 04:24:15.149 align:start position:0%
we talk about mar mar an issue with uh
uh

04:24:15.149 --> 04:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:18.790 --> 04:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
P like the difference between uh level
 
04:24:22.670 --> 04:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
that is proven uh uh toxic and the level
 
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
that allowed in the water could be like
 
04:24:28.630 --> 04:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh magnitude of difference like
 
04:24:31.070 --> 04:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
thousands of times difference but with
 
04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh fluoride that difference is is very
 
04:24:39.149 --> 04:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
low uh uh so that's also uh
 
04:24:42.910 --> 04:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
concerning and uh with State uh
 
04:24:46.550 --> 04:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
seeing more issues of Alzheimer's and
 
04:24:49.269 --> 04:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
low proficiency scores in our Public
 
04:24:52.830 --> 04:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
Schools uh I I think uh it's prudent uh
 
04:24:57.149 --> 04:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
to protect uh brains of our population
 
04:25:01.309 --> 04:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
and stop this uh nonv volunt uh
 
04:25:03.910 --> 04:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
medication thank you any questions for
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
the representative representative NAB
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for being
 
04:25:09.750 --> 04:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
here representative and for taking my
 
04:25:11.830 --> 04:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
question um you said there have been
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
suggest study committees but none have
 
04:25:16.910 --> 04:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
you we haven't had a study committee in
 
04:25:18.670 --> 04:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
the house on this yes that's correct
 
04:25:21.429 --> 04:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you they just sorry follow up
 
04:25:23.389 --> 04:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
follow up they just haven't passed or
 
04:25:26.189 --> 04:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
been approved yeah yeah yeah it uh it
 
04:25:28.830 --> 04:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't was not signed into law
 
04:25:32.750 --> 04:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
didn't thank you anyone else seeing none
 
04:25:34.510 --> 04:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
04:25:38.109 --> 04:25:38.119 align:start position:0%
next opposing the bill Marco philippon
 
04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:54.469 --> 04:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you members of the
 
04:25:55.830 --> 04:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for taking my
 
04:25:58.790 --> 04:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
testimony today uh I will uh go back to
 
04:26:01.349 --> 04:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
what my mother once told me be brief yet
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
be heard so I know I said five minutes
 
04:26:06.750 --> 04:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
I'll take less than two um my day job
 
04:26:08.030 --> 04:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm the water treatment superintendent
 
04:26:09.790 --> 04:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
for the city of conquered I am also on
 
04:26:11.229 --> 04:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
the legislative committee for New
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Waterworks
 
04:26:15.469 --> 04:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
Association uh and I'm here to say that
 
04:26:18.550 --> 04:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh we oppose the bill as written for
 
04:26:21.550 --> 04:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
three real specific reasons uh so for
 
04:26:22.750 --> 04:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
the city conquered New Hampshire
 
04:26:25.389 --> 04:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
Waterworks Association we support uh
 
04:26:27.670 --> 04:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
local decision making at the community
 
04:26:30.149 --> 04:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
level right uh there is secondly there
 
04:26:32.790 --> 04:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
is a mechanism to stop fluoridation uh
 
04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
so if any Community conquered wanted to
 
04:26:37.030 --> 04:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
do that the residents would simply uh
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
get in touch with their counselors get
 
04:26:40.830 --> 04:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
on the agenda a referendum vote and then
 
04:26:43.309 --> 04:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
we turn off the floration if the
 
04:26:44.670 --> 04:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
community so
 
04:26:46.910 --> 04:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
decides and uh you know one of the other
 
04:26:48.510 --> 04:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
things certainly if you understand the
 
04:26:50.950 --> 04:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
water world it's a very heavy uh heavily
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
regulated industry so we have folks uh
 
04:26:55.590 --> 04:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
good customers of M that sit up at the
 
04:26:57.550 --> 04:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
top of the hill mentioned before Dees
 
04:27:01.149 --> 04:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
and HHS and these folks monitor these
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
contaminants if you will for a living uh
 
04:27:05.950 --> 04:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
so they are very well aware of the
 
04:27:09.070 --> 04:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
subject much more vers than I am uh and
 
04:27:11.990 --> 04:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
they are looking at this continually so
 
04:27:13.590 --> 04:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh I believe if there was a
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
determination that at this time and
 
04:27:17.109 --> 04:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
again we've I won't bore you with with
 
04:27:18.870 --> 04:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
all of the science EPA is going to be
 
04:27:20.670 --> 04:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
looking at this again if it was
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
determined at this time that it was uh
 
04:27:25.590 --> 04:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
harmful to the population then it's very
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
straightforward they would regulate it
 
04:27:28.670 --> 04:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
out and we would have to comply again
 
04:27:30.870 --> 04:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
very simple process to stop
 
04:27:33.710 --> 04:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
floration um so for those reasons we we
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
oppose thank you any any questions for
 
04:27:40.030 --> 04:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
the speaker representative NAB thank you
 
04:27:41.269 --> 04:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
question um you said there you said
 
04:27:44.550 --> 04:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
there are 12 communities that add fluide
 
04:27:46.189 --> 04:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
to their public water do you have any
 
04:27:47.750 --> 04:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
estimate of the number of public water
 
04:27:49.349 --> 04:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
utilities in the
 
04:27:51.469 --> 04:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
state that I would know off the top of
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
my head Dees is here I can probably look
 
04:27:56.030 --> 04:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
to my left to get a rough number they
 
04:28:01.870 --> 04:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:05.309 --> 04:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
okay can we not ask people questions
 
04:28:07.149 --> 04:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
thank you you'll have an opportunity to
 
04:28:09.630 --> 04:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
speak follow up with yeah thank you
 
04:28:13.269 --> 04:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you anyone else
 
04:28:15.870 --> 04:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank
 
04:28:19.469 --> 04:28:19.479 align:start position:0%
you supporting the bill says he needs
 
04:28:21.830 --> 04:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
six minutes but I hope it's a little
 
04:28:26.189 --> 04:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
less uh Stuart Cooper fluide Action
 
04:28:44.030 --> 04:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:44.040 --> 04:28:46.429 align:start position:0%
 
Mr

04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:48.990 --> 04:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you my name is Stuart Cooper
 
04:28:50.109 --> 04:28:50.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm the executive director of the
 
04:28:51.790 --> 04:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire base nonprofit the florid
 
04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
Action Network founded in 2000 we're a
 
04:28:57.030 --> 04:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
watchdog group of over 5,500 medical and
 
04:28:58.870 --> 04:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
scientific professionals and an
 
04:29:00.510 --> 04:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
international leader on this topic in
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
fact we were the ones that just won the
 
04:29:03.109 --> 04:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
federal lawsuit against the United
 
04:29:05.630 --> 04:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
States Environmental Protection Agency
 
04:29:07.830 --> 04:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
that deemed water fluoridation a
 
04:29:10.389 --> 04:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
unreasonable risk to human health I've
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
been educating New Hampshire legislature
 
04:29:14.070 --> 04:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
about the issue for 15 years I wrote the
 
04:29:16.630 --> 04:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
law you see on page one of my handout
 
04:29:18.429 --> 04:29:18.439 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire passed in 2012 that
 
04:29:20.550 --> 04:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
requires warnings on water quality
 
04:29:22.870 --> 04:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
reports in Flor communities so parents
 
04:29:24.950 --> 04:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
don't reconstitute infant formula with
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
tap water due to overexposure to
 
04:29:29.469 --> 04:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
fluoride at that time the CDC data
 
04:29:31.750 --> 04:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
showed that 41% of our teens had Dental
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
fosis which is over a biomarker of
 
04:29:36.590 --> 04:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
overexposure to fluoride the new CDC
 
04:29:38.590 --> 04:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
data shows that number has increased to
 
04:29:41.750 --> 04:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
70% of our adolescents so you guys were
 
04:29:43.389 --> 04:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
right and the dental lobbyist behind me
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
who opposed the bill at the time were
 
04:29:49.469 --> 04:29:49.479 align:start position:0%
wrong uh now why I'm really here is
 
04:29:52.550 --> 04:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
because since uh actually in two a
 
04:29:54.510 --> 04:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
couple years ago this exact same
 
04:29:56.910 --> 04:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
committee voted in favor of this exact
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
same bill to prohibit floration 12 to9 I
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
included the blurb on the back of the
 
04:30:03.710 --> 04:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
front page so you can see why your your
 
04:30:04.990 --> 04:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
fellow committee members and even some
 
04:30:07.510 --> 04:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
of you voted in favor of this bill what
 
04:30:09.870 --> 04:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
has happened since a lot you were right
 
04:30:11.750 --> 04:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
then and I hopefully you'll do the same
 
04:30:11.760 --> 04:30:12.510 align:start position:0%
then and I hopefully you'll do the same
thing

04:30:12.510 --> 04:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:30:14.109 --> 04:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
right now as we speak there are eight
 
04:30:15.790 --> 04:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
bills in seven other states to prohibit
 
04:30:18.030 --> 04:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation Utah Senate just
 
04:30:19.630 --> 04:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
passed their prohibit prohibition Bill
 
04:30:23.550 --> 04:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
10 to3 and uh Hawaii all eight of the
 
04:30:25.389 --> 04:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
Big Island water operators have called
 
04:30:27.389 --> 04:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
for a Prohibition of fluoridation in

04:30:46.109 --> 04:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
of them now have bills to reverse those

just the past 8 weeks floration is
 
04:31:01.950 --> 04:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
unraveling in the coming weeks I'm
 
04:31:03.389 --> 04:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
announcing this now because we've
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
already been in communication with the

level are expected to send out an advis
 
04:31:14.109 --> 04:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
echoing the Florida Surgeon General
 
04:31:15.510 --> 04:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
recommending that all communities in the
 
04:31:17.590 --> 04:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
United States and water fluoridation due
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
to fetal and infant neurotoxicity and
 
04:31:21.910 --> 04:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
over exposure if we don't pass this law
 
04:31:23.630 --> 04:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire communities will
 
04:31:25.550 --> 04:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
not be able to act quickly because New
 
04:31:27.630 --> 04:31:27.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law currently requires a long
 
04:31:29.550 --> 04:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
referendum process thousands of
 
04:31:31.269 --> 04:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
signatures will have to be collected
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
City councils cannot make a decision
 
04:31:34.429 --> 04:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
right now in New Hampshire this will
 
04:31:36.109 --> 04:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
take years is New Hampshire going to be
 
04:31:37.830 --> 04:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
among the first states to act or among
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
the last so why is this happening well
 
04:31:43.149 --> 04:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
NIH in recent years has funded 10
 
04:31:45.030 --> 04:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
studies looking at fluoride and
 
04:31:47.630 --> 04:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
developmental neurotoxicity all 10 found
 
04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
developmental neurotoxicity at levels
 
04:31:52.950 --> 04:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
seen in FL day communities uh we the
 
04:31:55.550 --> 04:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
national toxicology program studied this
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
exact issue for eight years they
 
04:31:59.429 --> 04:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
published the report in August the
 
04:32:02.070 --> 04:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
report found that of the 74 studies on
 
04:32:04.429 --> 04:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
this issue 64 found developmental
 
04:32:07.590 --> 04:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
neurotoxicity that's 89% consistency of
 
04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
the 23 studies that they considered
 
04:32:12.830 --> 04:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
highest quality 95% of them found
 
04:32:14.670 --> 04:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
developmental neurotoxicity that's your
 
04:32:17.630 --> 04:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
National toxicology program a former
 
04:32:19.269 --> 04:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
director Linda bbom has come out
 
04:32:20.590 --> 04:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
recently in a statement saying water
 
04:32:21.870 --> 04:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
fluoridation should end you should not
 
04:32:23.550 --> 04:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
be adding a developmental neurotoxin to
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
the drinking
 
04:32:27.870 --> 04:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
water also this impacted our federal
 
04:32:30.750 --> 04:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuit we sued uh the EPA and federal
 
04:32:32.710 --> 04:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
court it was a eight-year lawsuit the
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
judge heard many weeks of testimony
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
hundreds of hours of deposition uh
 
04:32:41.109 --> 04:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
footage and he concluded that flu water
 
04:32:43.510 --> 04:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
fluoridation at 0 0.7 poses an
 
04:32:45.910 --> 04:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
unreasonable risk to human health he has
 
04:32:48.149 --> 04:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
now required the EPA to promulgate rules
 
04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
they have three years to do so that
 
04:32:52.349 --> 04:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
eliminate that risk tasa only allows two
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
things they can either pass a warning
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
telling pregnant women and children not
 
04:32:57.349 --> 04:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
to drink tap water which I don't think
 
04:32:59.189 --> 04:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
they're going to do or they can end the
 
04:33:02.189 --> 04:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
commercial sale of fuic acid and other
 
04:33:04.189 --> 04:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh fluoridation chemicals so
 
04:33:06.189 --> 04:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
fluoridation is already coming to an end
 
04:33:07.789 --> 04:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
the question is are you going to subject
 
04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens to three more
 
04:33:11.429 --> 04:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
years of it I have emailed all of you
 
04:33:14.789 --> 04:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
and I'm send it again after immediately
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
following this hearing of our deposition
 
04:33:19.269 --> 04:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
Clips we have deposition clips from CDC
 
04:33:21.269 --> 04:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
Representatives who will verify that
 
04:33:22.189 --> 04:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
what you're about to hear from the
 
04:33:24.429 --> 04:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
people behind me is inaccurate the CDC
 
04:33:26.029 --> 04:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that there's no benefit to
 
04:33:27.949 --> 04:33:27.959 align:start position:0%
infants from water fluoridation that
 
04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
they cannot site any evidence of benefit
 
04:33:31.670 --> 04:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
to swallowing fluoridation they have no
 
04:33:33.709 --> 04:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
safety data on fluoride in the brain the
 
04:33:35.949 --> 04:33:35.959 align:start position:0%
EPA said the exact same thing under oath
 
04:33:37.310 --> 04:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
as did the National Sanitation
 
04:33:39.310 --> 04:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
Foundation as did the American Dental
 
04:33:40.789 --> 04:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
Association you can watch these clips
 
04:33:43.629 --> 04:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
yourself in your email the CDC also said
 
04:33:44.990 --> 04:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
that there's no benefit to children's
 
04:33:46.750 --> 04:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
teeth if fluoride is swallowed by the
 
04:33:48.750 --> 04:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
mother and it does not provide benefit
 
04:33:51.629 --> 04:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
during the first six months of life
 
04:33:52.869 --> 04:33:52.879 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear that fluoridation
 
04:33:54.390 --> 04:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
is perfectly safe and effective I
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
challenge you hopefully one of you will
 
04:33:58.230 --> 04:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
ask those people saying that to provide
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
you one randomized control trial study
 
04:34:03.269 --> 04:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
in RCT the gold standard for evidence
 
04:34:05.310 --> 04:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
after 80 years of water fluoridation not
 
04:34:07.590 --> 04:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
a single RCT has ever been conducted on
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
the safety or effectiveness of water
 
04:34:11.349 --> 04:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
floration please ask for it they will
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
provide you do nothing because it
 
04:34:14.949 --> 04:34:14.959 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist and again the ntp found of
 
04:34:18.429 --> 04:34:18.439 align:start position:0%
74 studies looking at this subject 64
 
04:34:19.949 --> 04:34:19.959 align:start position:0%
found harm so there are no studies
 
04:34:23.750 --> 04:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
showing safety ntp did not find
 
04:34:26.789 --> 04:34:26.799 align:start position:0%
safety lastly I will point out that New
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire even though we're one of the
 
04:34:30.310 --> 04:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
least floridated states in the country
 
04:34:32.310 --> 04:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
and Vermont is actually the second least
 
04:34:34.510 --> 04:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
FL or among the least floridated state
 
04:34:36.869 --> 04:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
in the country our states are second and
 
04:34:38.830 --> 04:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
third in lowest rate of dental decay for
 
04:34:41.750 --> 04:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
children meanwhile states that are 99%
 
04:34:43.709 --> 04:34:43.719 align:start position:0%
floridated like Kentucky Minnesota and
 
04:34:46.310 --> 04:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
Illinois have double the Decay rates for
 
04:34:50.109 --> 04:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
their children um you know so I guess
 
04:34:51.629 --> 04:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
I'll happily take any questions if
 
04:34:53.189 --> 04:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
anyone has any about the lawsuit or
 
04:34:55.070 --> 04:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
anyone has any about the ntp report but
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
I would please just urge you to join 95%
 
04:35:01.510 --> 04:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the world and 98% of Europe in
 
04:35:03.189 --> 04:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
prohibiting water fluoridation we're the
 
04:35:05.470 --> 04:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
extreme outlier in this situation the
 
04:35:08.109 --> 04:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
science has changed the experts at least
 
04:35:11.670 --> 04:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
in toxicology are entirely on board with
 
04:35:13.070 --> 04:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
with ending water floration and that's
 
04:35:14.349 --> 04:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
what the science
 
04:35:17.470 --> 04:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
shows thank you any questions
 
04:35:19.269 --> 04:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question about
 
04:35:24.269 --> 04:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit entitled or captioned uh
 
04:35:26.830 --> 04:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
food and water watch Inc uh versus
 
04:35:28.869 --> 04:35:28.879 align:start position:0%
United States Environmental Protection
 
04:35:33.070 --> 04:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
Agency uh on September 24th
 
04:35:35.551 --> 04:35:35.561 align:start position:0%
2024 the judge in that
 
04:35:38.269 --> 04:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
case who is an Obama appointee and a
 
04:35:42.789 --> 04:35:42.799 align:start position:0%
former ACLU attorney uh issued an 8 page
 
04:35:46.150 --> 04:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
findings of fact and conclusions of law
 
04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh which for those who are not attorneys
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
um which I am uh it's basically the
 
04:35:52.990 --> 04:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
order the judge's order in the case uh
 
04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
in January I believe the EPA has uh
 
04:35:58.189 --> 04:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
filed an appeal of that and it's
 
04:35:59.869 --> 04:35:59.879 align:start position:0%
currently going up before the ninth
 
04:36:02.670 --> 04:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
circuit is are you part will you be
 
04:36:05.150 --> 04:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
participating in that appeal and do you
 
04:36:07.310 --> 04:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
think that moving now before the appeal
 
04:36:09.310 --> 04:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
is decided is premature actually I'm
 
04:36:10.830 --> 04:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
glad you brought up they filed a notice
 
04:36:13.470 --> 04:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
of appeal so no briefing and no appeal
 
04:36:16.910 --> 04:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
was actually filed and it was filed by
 
04:36:18.830 --> 04:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
an EPA administrator who was only in
 
04:36:20.310 --> 04:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
office for a couple weeks and he was
 
04:36:23.109 --> 04:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
fired the next day um and the Trump
 
04:36:25.629 --> 04:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
Administration has already uh put a
 
04:36:29.230 --> 04:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
90-day hold on all um such appeals and
 
04:36:31.230 --> 04:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
so that's going to go beyond the date
 
04:36:32.629 --> 04:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
when they could have the deadline's
 
04:36:34.029 --> 04:36:34.039 align:start position:0%
going to pass so the appeal it was the
 
04:36:35.429 --> 04:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
notice of appeal was actually at this
 
04:36:38.070 --> 04:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
point Moot and meaningless if they do um
 
04:36:40.230 --> 04:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
appeal if there is some official appeal
 
04:36:41.590 --> 04:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
by the Trump Administration although I
 
04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
don't believe there will be because
 
04:36:45.150 --> 04:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
their HHS has already told us that
 
04:36:46.709 --> 04:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to be putting on advisory
 
04:36:48.429 --> 04:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
telling communities and fluoridation we
 
04:36:52.150 --> 04:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
will of course fight the appeal yeah one
 
04:36:55.070 --> 04:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
followup huh that unfortunately for me
 
04:36:56.910 --> 04:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
that's more of a problem I would rather
 
04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
have you know if you have the nice
 
04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
circuit coming out and affirming this
 
04:37:03.551 --> 04:37:03.561 align:start position:0%
decision I think you've got settled law
 
04:37:06.910 --> 04:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
pretty solid uh now if that's not going
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
to happen um I guess my opinion of
 
04:37:10.990 --> 04:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
things is a little up in the air okay
 
04:37:11.000 --> 04:37:13.269 align:start position:0%
things is a little up in the air okay
sorry

04:37:13.269 --> 04:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:37:15.230 --> 04:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a question to the
 
04:37:17.470 --> 04:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
speaker don't see any thank you very
 
04:37:19.990 --> 04:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
much hey thank you very
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
much opposing the bill
 
04:37:26.470 --> 04:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh bear with me because I can't read the
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
Lori or the clerk can you spell your
 
04:37:34.000 --> 04:37:38.310 align:start position:0%
Lori or the clerk can you spell your
last

04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:40.670 --> 04:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
name hello everyone thank you can you
 
04:37:42.990 --> 04:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
hear me okay
 
04:37:45.029 --> 04:37:45.039 align:start position:0%
my name is Lori Rosado I'm a resident
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
and general dentist serving the greater
 
04:37:49.230 --> 04:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
conquered area I'm here today in full
 
04:37:51.629 --> 04:37:51.639 align:start position:0%
opposition of the bill concret
 
04:37:53.310 --> 04:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
fluoridated water is helping make the
 
04:37:55.230 --> 04:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
difference between my young patients
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
needing a regular cleaning and my young
 
04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
patients needing extensive dental care I
 
04:38:02.670 --> 04:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
look around this room I know a lot of
 
04:38:04.150 --> 04:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
you have dental work in your mouth it's
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
just a fact of human nature of when you
 
04:38:08.189 --> 04:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
grew up and you didn't have the fluoride
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
that the kids have today and it's needed
 
04:38:11.949 --> 04:38:11.959 align:start position:0%
in the water and many of you didn't have
 
04:38:15.510 --> 04:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
it I see the proof of that every day in
 
04:38:18.869 --> 04:38:18.879 align:start position:0%
practice as it what I have not seen here
 
04:38:21.189 --> 04:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
however are examples of neurological
 
04:38:23.150 --> 04:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
disorders that are connected to the
 
04:38:25.629 --> 04:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
community water fluoridation and we have
 
04:38:27.750 --> 04:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
the studies to prove
 
04:38:30.470 --> 04:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
that such issues are scientifically
 
04:38:33.869 --> 04:38:33.879 align:start position:0%
linked to Decay scientifically and or
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
disorders are scientifically linked to
 
04:38:38.750 --> 04:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
poor diet high levels of naturally
 
04:38:41.869 --> 04:38:41.879 align:start position:0%
occurring fluide fluoride in well and
 
04:38:44.429 --> 04:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
other non-regulated water sources and
 
04:38:46.750 --> 04:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
other unrelated environmental and health
 
04:38:48.910 --> 04:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
conditions but they're not related to
 
04:38:51.830 --> 04:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
properly fluoridated water like that
 
04:38:53.310 --> 04:38:53.320 align:start position:0%
which we drink and conquered in other
 
04:38:54.869 --> 04:38:54.879 align:start position:0%
areas that are
 
04:38:57.189 --> 04:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
floridated as a dentist I've read the
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
national toxicology program's recent
 
04:39:02.349 --> 04:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
monograph it's lengthy I encourage you
 
04:39:04.349 --> 04:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
to try to read it there's a lot in there
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
that is probably you need a science mind
 
04:39:10.109 --> 04:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
to read it but essentially in there
 
04:39:11.990 --> 04:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in that document that
 
04:39:15.750 --> 04:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
even suggests that the standard of 7
 
04:39:19.789 --> 04:39:19.799 align:start position:0%
parts per million in our water is
 
04:39:24.029 --> 04:39:24.039 align:start position:0%
unsafe in that study there it states
 
04:39:26.949 --> 04:39:26.959 align:start position:0%
double that dose to be causing the
 
04:39:29.230 --> 04:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
issues of neurological disorders of
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
which we don't do we do 7 parts per
 
04:39:33.310 --> 04:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
million currently in floridated
 
04:39:33.320 --> 04:39:34.349 align:start position:0%
million currently in floridated
community

04:39:34.349 --> 04:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:39:37.150 --> 04:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
water certainly a high dose of fluoride
 
04:39:39.788 --> 04:39:39.798 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 parts per million for example
 
04:39:41.948 --> 04:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
post health risks just like anything
 
04:39:44.230 --> 04:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
else someone mentioned alcohol earlier
 
04:39:45.750 --> 04:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
anything at a high dose is going to
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
cause health risks the solution for
 
04:39:49.868 --> 04:39:49.878 align:start position:0%
anyone who's concern that they're
 
04:39:51.788 --> 04:39:51.798 align:start position:0%
consuming too much fluoride is not to
 
04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
ban the water
 
04:39:55.708 --> 04:39:55.718 align:start position:0%
fluoridation which only accounts for
 
04:39:57.550 --> 04:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
about half of the state's Water Supplies
 
04:39:59.990 --> 04:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
as the numbers were just said rather
 
04:40:01.868 --> 04:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
residents should talk to their physician
 
04:40:04.868 --> 04:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
and their dentist to determine cause the
 
04:40:07.270 --> 04:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
cause issues that they're worried about
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
but the evidence-based research that I
 
04:40:10.948 --> 04:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
receive from legitimate sources the
 
04:40:13.590 --> 04:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
American Dental Association centers the
 
04:40:16.030 --> 04:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
CDC the American Medical Association the
 
04:40:19.350 --> 04:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
wh there's countless University studies
 
04:40:22.110 --> 04:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
hundreds thousands of them all answer
 
04:40:24.788 --> 04:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
the questions this bill asks fluoride
 
04:40:28.270 --> 04:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
and proper dosage is safe and beneficial
 
04:40:28.280 --> 04:40:29.230 align:start position:0%
and proper dosage is safe and beneficial
for

04:40:29.230 --> 04:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:40:32.310 --> 04:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
children if my testimony my testimony
 
04:40:36.030 --> 04:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
and I feel seem familiar I along with
 
04:40:37.470 --> 04:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
many of my dentist colleagues have
 
04:40:39.948 --> 04:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
appeared before you before presenting
 
04:40:41.750 --> 04:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
this information on multiple
 
04:40:44.750 --> 04:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
occasions and each time we've had the
 
04:40:46.788 --> 04:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
same people oppose us and we come to the
 
04:40:48.350 --> 04:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
same conclusion of its
 
04:40:50.830 --> 04:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
safety dentists are here to protect
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
protect the public oral health we gain
 
04:40:56.230 --> 04:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
nothing monetarily by asking for you to
 
04:40:58.150 --> 04:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
vote against this bill or by advocating
 
04:41:00.070 --> 04:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
for local community water fluoridation
 
04:41:02.910 --> 04:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
initiatives it's simple to me I want my
 
04:41:05.628 --> 04:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
patients regardless of their financial
 
04:41:08.510 --> 04:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
situation to utilize every option to
 
04:41:10.350 --> 04:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
stay healthy I'm committed to the
 
04:41:12.030 --> 04:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
hypocritic oath
 
04:41:13.708 --> 04:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
and and a strict code of professional
 
04:41:15.628 --> 04:41:15.638 align:start position:0%
ethics that bind me to the best possible
 
04:41:17.550 --> 04:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
care for my patients there's no
 
04:41:19.470 --> 04:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence or imperative to
 
04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
Warrant the establishment of yet another
 
04:41:24.910 --> 04:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee I therefore
 
04:41:27.270 --> 04:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
ask that you vote this bill in expedient
 
04:41:30.270 --> 04:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
to legislate thank you thank you Doctor

project and I've done research on
 
04:42:24.590 --> 04:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
fluoride for over 30 years I want to
 
04:42:27.310 --> 04:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
First address the most glaring false
 
04:42:29.470 --> 04:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
messaging that Defenders of floration
 
04:42:32.430 --> 04:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
seem to have chosen as their response to
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
the National toxicology programs report
 
04:42:36.310 --> 04:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
on fluide
 
04:42:38.550 --> 04:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
neurotoxicity and the federal Court's
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
decision that floration poses an unre
 
04:42:44.948 --> 04:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
reasonable risk of child IQ loss
 
04:42:47.788 --> 04:42:47.798 align:start position:0%
Floridan Defenders claim there are no
 
04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
studies finding IQ loss at exposures
 
04:42:52.230 --> 04:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
relevant to water
 
04:42:54.510 --> 04:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
fluoridation they say studies finding
 
04:42:57.750 --> 04:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
harm were only at exposures twice as
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
high as from fluoridated water
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
fluoridation in the US has done at a
 
04:43:05.868 --> 04:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
concentration of 0.7 milligrams of
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
fluoride per
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
liter and the false message is that only
 
04:43:12.788 --> 04:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
studies with con concentrations of 1.5
 
04:43:15.350 --> 04:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
MGR per liter or higher have found IQ
 
04:43:19.510 --> 04:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
loss but this is simply not true page
 
04:43:22.270 --> 04:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
one of my handout shows the recent
 
04:43:24.670 --> 04:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
systematic reviews of fluoride
 
04:43:27.750 --> 04:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
neurotoxicity all within the past year
 
04:43:30.070 --> 04:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
as well as the court decision each of
 
04:43:32.350 --> 04:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
these considered the evidence from all
 
04:43:34.590 --> 04:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
studies they didn't just cherry-pick a
 
04:43:36.310 --> 04:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
few studies that showed what somebody
 
04:43:37.390 --> 04:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
04:43:39.868 --> 04:43:39.878 align:start position:0%
show if you look at the figure on page
 
04:43:43.510 --> 04:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
two of the out you'll see a chart
 
04:43:45.310 --> 04:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
illustrating the actual fluoride
 
04:43:47.510 --> 04:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
exposure levels of all the studies rated
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
high quality by the
 
04:43:53.190 --> 04:43:53.200 align:start position:0%

04:44:04.750 --> 04:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
per liter furthermore three of those
 
04:44:06.670 --> 04:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
were specifically from artificial
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
fluoridation at 7 mg per liter or its
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
equivalent from floridated
 
04:44:15.948 --> 04:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
Salt studies finding IQ loss are
 
04:44:19.150 --> 04:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
colorcoded with the blue symbol all of
 
04:44:21.948 --> 04:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
the studies above 1.5 have the blue
 
04:44:26.070 --> 04:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
symbol and the majority below 1.5
 
04:44:28.990 --> 04:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
do floration Defenders are simply not
 
04:44:30.670 --> 04:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
telling you the truth when they claim
 
04:44:33.708 --> 04:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
there are no studies finding harm at 7
 
04:44:35.590 --> 04:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
or below
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
1.5 furthermore their argument that 1.5
 
04:44:42.070 --> 04:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
is so much above point 7 that it is
 
04:44:44.788 --> 04:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to artificial fluoridation
 
04:44:48.788 --> 04:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
ignores basic risk assessment principles
 
04:44:50.510 --> 04:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
and this is why the federal court
 
04:44:52.230 --> 04:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
decision ruled that fluoridation at
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
point 7 poses an unreasonable risk of IQ
 
04:44:58.750 --> 04:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
loss for children it is scientifically
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
wellestablished that some people are
 
04:45:04.070 --> 04:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
more sensitive than the average for any
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
toxic chemical were not all the same
 
04:45:09.390 --> 04:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
there should be nothing surprising about
 
04:45:12.550 --> 04:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
this toxic ologists have established
 
04:45:14.788 --> 04:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
that a few percent of people in any
 
04:45:17.470 --> 04:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
population are typically 10 times more
 
04:45:19.628 --> 04:45:19.638 align:start position:0%
sensitive than the average what that
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
means for fluoride is that a few percent
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
of children exposed to oneth of 1.5
 
04:45:29.070 --> 04:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
milligrams per liter 15 will suffer the
 
04:45:31.788 --> 04:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
same IQ loss as the average child will
 
04:45:34.270 --> 04:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
suffer at
 
04:45:36.510 --> 04:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
1.5 the federal court decision
 
04:45:39.830 --> 04:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
recognized this and said the court finds
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
that floration of water at 7 mg per
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
liter the level presently considered
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
optimal in the United States poses an
 
04:45:50.110 --> 04:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
unreasonable risk of reduced IQ in
 
04:45:52.430 --> 04:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
children there is substantial and
 
04:45:54.230 --> 04:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
scientifically credible evidence
 
04:45:56.350 --> 04:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
establishing that fluoride poses a risk
 
04:45:58.830 --> 04:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
to human health it is associated with a
 
04:46:00.868 --> 04:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
reduction in the IQ of children and is
 
04:46:03.868 --> 04:46:03.878 align:start position:0%
hazardous at dosages that are far too
 
04:46:05.750 --> 04:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
close to fluoride levels in the drinking
 
04:46:07.788 --> 04:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
water of the
 
04:46:10.708 --> 04:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
US another argument that you will often
 
04:46:12.948 --> 04:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
hear hear from Defenders of floration is
 
04:46:15.470 --> 04:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
that if it is stopped the rates of
 
04:46:18.350 --> 04:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
cavities would go way up but that is
 
04:46:21.868 --> 04:46:21.878 align:start position:0%
based on two poor quality cherry-picked
 
04:46:25.868 --> 04:46:25.878 align:start position:0%
studies in contrast a recent systematic
 
04:46:28.910 --> 04:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
review examining all the evidence by the
 
04:46:31.948 --> 04:46:31.958 align:start position:0%
authoritative Cochran collaboration
 
04:46:33.990 --> 04:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
found that there is no longer any
 
04:46:36.070 --> 04:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
statistically significant benefit from
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
fluoridation and at best only about a
 
04:46:41.948 --> 04:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
one quarter cavity per child
 
04:46:44.070 --> 04:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
they found that fluoridation
 
04:46:45.868 --> 04:46:45.878 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness has greatly diminished
 
04:46:49.390 --> 04:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
over the past 50 years if you turn on my
 
04:46:52.788 --> 04:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
handout to Pages four and five there are
 
04:46:55.030 --> 04:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
graphs of their data showing this
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
diminishment page four is baby Fe baby
 
04:46:59.788 --> 04:46:59.798 align:start position:0%
teeth and five for permanent
 
04:47:02.390 --> 04:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
teeth the Cochran review said this
 
04:47:03.990 --> 04:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
diminishment in fluoridation
 
04:47:06.270 --> 04:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness is likely because fluoride
 
04:47:09.230 --> 04:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
toothpaste has become almost Universal
 
04:47:11.670 --> 04:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
since it was first introduced 50 years
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
ago with widespread use of fluoride
 
04:47:16.430 --> 04:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
toothpaste there is no longer any
 
04:47:18.990 --> 04:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
significant benefit to also having
 
04:47:22.590 --> 04:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
fluoridated Water and toothpaste you can
 
04:47:25.470 --> 04:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
spit out so you can avoid avoid the
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
risks while getting the dental
 
04:47:31.830 --> 04:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
benefits and I'll briefly explain why
 
04:47:34.510 --> 04:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
the fluoridation Advocates two cherry
 
04:47:36.590 --> 04:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
pick studies don't actually support the
 
04:47:38.590 --> 04:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
claim that stopping fluoridation causes
 
04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
an increase in tooth decay the two
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
studies one was in Calgary Canada and
 
04:47:44.390 --> 04:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
the other in
 
04:47:47.628 --> 04:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
Alaska what you won't hear is that the
 
04:47:49.910 --> 04:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
cavity rates in Calgary were going up
 
04:47:52.390 --> 04:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
even during the years before floration
 
04:47:52.400 --> 04:47:53.470 align:start position:0%
even during the years before floration
was

04:47:53.470 --> 04:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:47:53.480 --> 04:47:55.070 align:start position:0%
was
stopped

04:47:55.070 --> 04:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
stopped
 
04:47:58.270 --> 04:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
um they continued climbing gradually
 
04:48:00.030 --> 04:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
after fluoridation was stopped but they
 
04:48:03.750 --> 04:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
did not Spike spike unknown factors were
 
04:48:05.750 --> 04:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
causing cavity rates to climb during the
 
04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
years before cessation so it is a
 
04:48:10.910 --> 04:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation to claim stopping FL
 
04:48:14.470 --> 04:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
ation caused the continuing slow
 
04:48:17.708 --> 04:48:17.718 align:start position:0%
increase and far from being a spike it
 
04:48:20.590 --> 04:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
was only about half a cavity per child
 
04:48:22.590 --> 04:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
and that's the same rate of increase as
 
04:48:25.830 --> 04:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the years before fluoridation stopped
 
04:48:28.868 --> 04:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
as for the Alaska study well it didn't
 
04:48:31.390 --> 04:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
measure cavities it measured Medicaid
 
04:48:34.948 --> 04:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
reimbursements for dental work and what
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
you won't be told by the Florida
 
04:48:40.070 --> 04:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
Defenders is that Alaska which gets huge
 
04:48:42.788 --> 04:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
revenues from the oil industry chose to
 
04:48:44.350 --> 04:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
greatly increase the Medicaid
 
04:48:47.110 --> 04:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates for child Dental
 
04:48:50.270 --> 04:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
treatments most dentists won't even
 
04:48:52.510 --> 04:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
accept Medicaid patients because
 
04:48:54.430 --> 04:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursements are typically
 
04:48:57.910 --> 04:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
too low but when Alaska boosted them the
 
04:48:59.910 --> 04:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
med the reimbursement rates more
 
04:49:02.070 --> 04:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
dentists likely found it was worthwhile
 
04:49:04.830 --> 04:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
to accept children on Medicaid and they
 
04:49:06.868 --> 04:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
likely did more procedures because now
 
04:49:09.390 --> 04:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
they were profitable instead of money
 
04:49:12.110 --> 04:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
losers C ceing fluoridation in New
 
04:49:14.548 --> 04:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is unlikely to increase
 
04:49:17.070 --> 04:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
cavities those claiming it will are
 
04:49:20.750 --> 04:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
using poor quality and decades old
 
04:49:23.110 --> 04:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
studies thank you any questions for the
 
04:49:26.230 --> 04:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
speaker yes representative Ryan thank
 
04:49:28.150 --> 04:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
you for Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:49:31.868 --> 04:49:31.878 align:start position:0%
question um as a science ski teacher I
 
04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
just have a question um it says presumed
 
04:49:36.430 --> 04:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
Hazard and moderate confidence in your
 
04:49:40.190 --> 04:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
levels of study how many children are we
 
04:49:42.510 --> 04:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
actually talking about that were studied
 
04:49:45.670 --> 04:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh which are you talking about something
 
04:49:47.788 --> 04:49:47.798 align:start position:0%
in the hand um it says where did the ntp
 
04:49:50.150 --> 04:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
find on your six-year floor of
 
04:49:50.160 --> 04:49:54.230 align:start position:0%
find on your six-year floor of
neurotoxicity

04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
evaluation are you are you referring to
 
04:49:59.350 --> 04:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
something in the sand out um it's on
 
04:50:03.270 --> 04:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
online your 19 your 2022
 
04:50:06.510 --> 04:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
study 202 are you talking about me
 
04:50:09.910 --> 04:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
personally it's submitted by you yes
 
04:50:11.310 --> 04:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
Chris right
 
04:50:14.350 --> 04:50:14.360 align:start position:0%
yes I mean i' I've I've done I'm just
 
04:50:18.150 --> 04:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
cous I've done I did a presentation in
 
04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
2022 I'm trying to remember could you
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
quote what I said again so that I can
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
remember what I said said what did the
 
04:50:26.910 --> 04:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
ntp find um moderate conference and
 
04:50:30.910 --> 04:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
presumed Hazard my question is how many
 
04:50:32.548 --> 04:50:32.558 align:start position:0%
people are we talking about that were
 
04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
studied oh okay um that was a draft
 
04:50:37.670 --> 04:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
version the the the ones that were
 
04:50:39.390 --> 04:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
published recently are are more up to
 
04:50:42.230 --> 04:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
date um I don't remember the exact
 
04:50:44.788 --> 04:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
number they did they combined they did
 
04:50:47.430 --> 04:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
meta analysis which is combining the
 
04:50:51.230 --> 04:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
studies and there were I think 10,000
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
children in them and there were about
 
04:50:55.990 --> 04:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
and they they only did well they did it
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
for the high quality studies I think
 
04:51:00.990 --> 04:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
there were about
 
04:51:04.350 --> 04:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
10,000 um children that was your
 
04:51:06.948 --> 04:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
question point of clar so point of
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
clarification there were there were over
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
10,000 children studies
 
04:51:14.150 --> 04:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
tested with for these lower
 
04:51:18.548 --> 04:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
IQs there were in the um dozen or so
 
04:51:19.868 --> 04:51:19.878 align:start position:0%
high quality
 
04:51:23.590 --> 04:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
studies uh some of them had 500 kids
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
some of them had
 
04:51:27.510 --> 04:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
300 when when you added them all
 
04:51:28.628 --> 04:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
together there were something like
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
10,000 and a meta analysis you combine
 
04:51:35.990 --> 04:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
um results from multiple studies to get
 
04:51:38.628 --> 04:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
so that just one or two studies you know
 
04:51:41.470 --> 04:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
don't drive what you can't it's it's the
 
04:51:43.470 --> 04:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
way to avoid cherry picking is to
 
04:51:45.510 --> 04:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
combine them I I don't remember the
 
04:51:48.190 --> 04:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
exact number but it was in the thousands
 
04:51:50.510 --> 04:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions for
 
04:51:53.150 --> 04:51:53.160 align:start position:0%

in opposition to HB 691 this bill
 
04:52:39.310 --> 04:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
proposes the outright ban of a practice

that over Decades of research has proven
 
04:52:43.830 --> 04:52:43.840 align:start position:0%

health experts with legitimate
 
04:52:59.390 --> 04:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
scientific data and some of them are
 
04:53:02.110 --> 04:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
here today as well uh and they have
 
04:53:04.548 --> 04:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
researched and lent their expertise to
 
04:53:06.910 --> 04:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
research uh on the health benefits and

2016 the general court ultimately
 
04:53:23.150 --> 04:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
accepted the same
 
04:53:26.110 --> 04:53:26.120 align:start position:0%
conclusions in halting such dangerous
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%

I've already submitted to the group and
 
04:54:12.590 --> 04:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
I hope your email is working so you can
 
04:54:16.150 --> 04:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
look at it uh I an exhaustive list of
 
04:54:20.030 --> 04:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
recent and uh impactful studies that
 
04:54:22.190 --> 04:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
pretty much uh counter what has been
 
04:54:24.070 --> 04:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
presented here so far by some of the
 
04:54:26.190 --> 04:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
Advocates and I encourage you all to
 
04:54:28.110 --> 04:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
take a look at those and ask us any
 
04:54:30.628 --> 04:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
questions in New Hampshire as stated
 
04:54:32.670 --> 04:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
earlier we have a decision-making
 
04:54:34.830 --> 04:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
process that we leave to the
 
04:54:37.190 --> 04:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities when it comes to
 
04:54:39.948 --> 04:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
floration in the past some Advocates
 
04:54:42.150 --> 04:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
have tried to circumvent that process
 
04:54:44.150 --> 04:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
because they were unable to convince
 
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
residents that fluoride was
 
04:54:50.830 --> 04:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous in fact uh in residents in do
 
04:54:53.230 --> 04:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
lonia Manchester and
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
Conquer many of these uh Community or
 
04:54:57.110 --> 04:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
actually all of these communities have
 
04:54:59.350 --> 04:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
chosen not to revisit
 
04:55:01.470 --> 04:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
floration uh and put it on the ballot
 
04:55:03.270 --> 04:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
because their children have experienced
 
04:55:05.948 --> 04:55:05.958 align:start position:0%
the health benefits of floration and
 
04:55:08.030 --> 04:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
none of the issues that you've heard
 
04:55:11.470 --> 04:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
about whether it's I Q drops or anything
 
04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
like that could be attributed to
 
04:55:16.948 --> 04:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
anything could be attributed to C
 
04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
CWF put simply this bill is a misguided
 
04:55:23.910 --> 04:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
solution to a non-existent issue
 
04:55:26.070 --> 04:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
Community water fluoridation is the most
 
04:55:29.030 --> 04:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
costeffective method of delivering the
 
04:55:30.670 --> 04:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
health effects of fluoride to all
 
04:55:32.868 --> 04:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
members of the community regardless of
 
04:55:35.948 --> 04:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
age educational attainment or income
 
04:55:38.948 --> 04:55:38.958 align:start position:0%
level for all these reasons the New
 
04:55:41.150 --> 04:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dental Society repres
 
04:55:42.990 --> 04:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully requests that this
 
04:55:45.868 --> 04:55:45.878 align:start position:0%
committee rejects this legislation and
 
04:55:48.708 --> 04:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
vote it inexpedient to legislate I'll
 
04:55:49.590 --> 04:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
take your
 
04:55:52.430 --> 04:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
questions questions for the speaker
 
04:55:54.590 --> 04:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
representative Sergeant thank you Mr
 
04:55:55.868 --> 04:55:55.878 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
question does the Ada or the New
 
04:56:01.270 --> 04:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Ada have a response to the
 
04:56:04.830 --> 04:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
court decision uh from September of
 
04:56:07.708 --> 04:56:07.718 align:start position:0%
20124 thank you rep through the chair
 
04:56:08.788 --> 04:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
04:56:12.390 --> 04:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
question um yes Ada has sent in a
 
04:56:15.070 --> 04:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
actually was part of the uh motion to
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
appeal uh it has been actively involved
 
04:56:19.830 --> 04:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
with that a statement was issued
 
04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
actually in the uh Washington Post uh
 
04:56:23.990 --> 04:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago regarding from our
 
04:56:27.868 --> 04:56:27.878 align:start position:0%
president uh Dr Brett Kesler in Chicago
 
04:56:30.708 --> 04:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
and uh we continue to Advocate uh with
 
04:56:33.670 --> 04:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
the APA EPA hopefully that they will uh
 
04:56:36.708 --> 04:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
reconsider this uh
 
04:56:38.948 --> 04:56:38.958 align:start position:0%
decision any other questions for the
 
04:56:41.628 --> 04:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you for your
 
04:56:44.350 --> 04:56:44.360 align:start position:0%
presentation and it wasn't 45 minutes so
 
04:56:46.350 --> 04:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
you did good as they
 
04:56:50.110 --> 04:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
say uh supporting the bill Lissa texler
 
04:56:50.120 --> 04:56:51.030 align:start position:0%
say uh supporting the bill Lissa texler
for

04:56:51.030 --> 04:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:56:58.110 --> 04:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:01.190 --> 04:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
you you see the red light then you know
 
04:57:03.270 --> 04:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
hi Lissa
 
04:57:07.708 --> 04:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
Trexler I'm here in support of HB 691 I
 
04:57:11.190 --> 04:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
I've been a registered nurse since 1995
 
04:57:13.430 --> 04:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
and I want to talk about the primary
 
04:57:16.070 --> 04:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
reasons to cease water fluoridation I
 
04:57:17.750 --> 04:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
feel like they're self-explanatory at
 
04:57:22.230 --> 04:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
this point fluoridation is not legal the
 
04:57:24.270 --> 04:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
FDA guidelines require that drugs be
 
04:57:26.030 --> 04:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
prescribed by a licensed health care
 
04:57:28.708 --> 04:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
professional for a known deficiency or
 
04:57:31.030 --> 04:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
disease with the dosage to be determined
 
04:57:33.270 --> 04:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
by the patient's age body weight and
 
04:57:35.628 --> 04:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
other relevant considerations once
 
04:57:37.868 --> 04:57:37.878 align:start position:0%
fluoride is added to the
 
04:57:41.750 --> 04:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
water um and and with water fluoridation
 
04:57:44.310 --> 04:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
we're drinking it eating it and bathing
 
04:57:46.270 --> 04:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
in it once it's added there's no way of
 
04:57:49.430 --> 04:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
controlling who receives how much um how
 
04:57:51.590 --> 04:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
much is consumed so ounce per ounce a
 
04:57:53.628 --> 04:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
small child consumes as much fluoride as
 
04:57:56.948 --> 04:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
an adult and um like they've mentioned
 
04:57:58.548 --> 04:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
in previous
 
04:58:01.548 --> 04:58:01.558 align:start position:0%
testimony as proponents of fluoridation
 
04:58:03.868 --> 04:58:03.878 align:start position:0%
um they're they're claiming there's
 
04:58:05.788 --> 04:58:05.798 align:start position:0%
there's a measurement there's there is
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
no way to measure
 
04:58:11.390 --> 04:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
that um fluoridation is not ethical
 
04:58:13.990 --> 04:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
forcing medication on citizens without
 
04:58:15.948 --> 04:58:15.958 align:start position:0%
their knowledge or against their will
 
04:58:18.470 --> 04:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
violates their right to informed consent
 
04:58:20.430 --> 04:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
to medical treatment this means that
 
04:58:22.350 --> 04:58:22.360 align:start position:0%
communities are doing to everyone what a
 
04:58:25.590 --> 04:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
health care provider can do to no one
 
04:58:27.990 --> 04:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
fluide is not a nutrient there is no
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
biochemical process in the human body
 
04:58:32.030 --> 04:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
that has ever demonstrated the need for
 
04:58:34.590 --> 04:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
fluoride therefore no deficiency is
 
04:58:37.110 --> 04:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
possible adding it to the water violates
 
04:58:40.310 --> 04:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
the nberg code for human experimentation
 
04:58:43.310 --> 04:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
fluoridation harms the environment more
 
04:58:46.190 --> 04:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
than 97% of fluoride goes down the drain

polluting our waterways and soil thus
 
04:58:51.390 --> 04:58:51.400 align:start position:0%

04:58:54.670 --> 04:58:54.680 align:start position:0%

04:58:56.470 --> 04:58:56.480 align:start position:0%

04:59:10.270 --> 04:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
Lie the FDA considers fluoride a drug
 
04:59:13.350 --> 04:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
but the EPA considers fluoride hazardous
 
04:59:15.030 --> 04:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
material that's because water
 
04:59:16.788 --> 04:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
fluoridated fluoridation chemicals are
 
04:59:19.628 --> 04:59:19.638 align:start position:0%
not comprised of the natural occurring
 
04:59:22.030 --> 04:59:22.040 align:start position:0%

former EPA official Rebecca hmmer the
 
04:59:55.510 --> 04:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
solution to pollution is dilution so
 
04:59:57.070 --> 04:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
rather than paying for the safe disposal
 
04:59:58.470 --> 04:59:58.480 align:start position:0%

allowed to sell
 
05:00:02.310 --> 05:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
it there's a growing awareness in the
 
05:00:04.270 --> 05:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
health care profession that fluoride
 
05:00:06.910 --> 05:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
ingestion continues to be implicated in

fluoridated
 
05:00:38.310 --> 05:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
water and uh to quote former American
 
05:00:40.628 --> 05:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
Medical Association president
 
05:00:43.270 --> 05:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
Dr Charles hay don't drink fluoridated
 
05:00:45.470 --> 05:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
water fluoride is a corrosive poison
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
which will produce harm on a long-term
 
05:00:50.510 --> 05:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
basis does it make any sense to continue
 
05:00:53.750 --> 05:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
to pay for this archaic and harmful
 
05:00:56.830 --> 05:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
practice citizens can choose to use
 
05:00:58.708 --> 05:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
fluoride toothpaste and fluoride
 
05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
mouthwash and then they can take
 
05:01:02.708 --> 05:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
fluoride topical applications and
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
fluoride tablets and there are other
 
05:01:06.670 --> 05:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
options as well in collaboration with
 
05:01:08.310 --> 05:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
their trusted doctors and
 
05:01:12.350 --> 05:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
dentists I ask that that you um o that
 
05:01:15.708 --> 05:01:15.718 align:start position:0%

in written testimony to the clerk it's
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%

05:02:24.628 --> 05:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
yes are we ready yes ready okay um thank
 
05:02:26.670 --> 05:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
you very much for the opportunity to
 
05:02:29.590 --> 05:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
join you today my name is Gail Brown I'm
 
05:02:31.470 --> 05:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire oral health
 
05:02:34.110 --> 05:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
Coalition and if you want to know who
 
05:02:36.708 --> 05:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
our um governance and leadership group
 
05:02:38.070 --> 05:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
is they're on the right of your
 
05:02:40.830 --> 05:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
testimony so take a look at that
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here today on behalf of our
 
05:02:48.270 --> 05:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
coalition to oppose the passage of HB
 
05:02:51.750 --> 05:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
691 I'm going to um name a couple of
 
05:02:53.590 --> 05:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
points but I'm only going to discuss one
 
05:02:56.628 --> 05:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
of these today so um don't don't get too
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
nervous um one reason we oppose this
 
05:03:02.670 --> 05:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
bill is because we um have followed 70
 
05:03:05.990 --> 05:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
plus years of science that supports the
 
05:03:09.350 --> 05:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of opally managed
 
05:03:11.470 --> 05:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
community water
 
05:03:14.430 --> 05:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
fluoridation because we have heard from
 
05:03:18.270 --> 05:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
the former U Medicaid dental director
 
05:03:21.230 --> 05:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
that eliminating the fluoridation
 
05:03:23.990 --> 05:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
triggers an increase in state spending
 
05:03:26.708 --> 05:03:26.718 align:start position:0%
for dental restorative care for children
 
05:03:28.390 --> 05:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
and I would like to add adults we
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
haven't talked a lot about adults but
 
05:03:32.868 --> 05:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
fluoride is very important including
 
05:03:36.590 --> 05:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
Community water fluoridation across the
 
05:03:40.070 --> 05:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
lifespan and also um we feel that this
 
05:03:43.390 --> 05:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
usurps local rule um the decisions about
 
05:03:45.750 --> 05:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
putting water systems onto a
 
05:03:48.270 --> 05:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
fluoridation plan does come locally and
 
05:03:50.788 --> 05:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
we in New Hampshire hold that very very
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
dear and um neither the state or us
 
05:03:56.270 --> 05:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
constitutions has given that power over
 
05:03:59.230 --> 05:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
to the state so um we strongly support
 
05:04:01.990 --> 05:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
continued local rule I'm going to go
 
05:04:04.830 --> 05:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
into my fourth point which I is really
 
05:04:07.070 --> 05:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
what I want to focus on today but I do
 
05:04:09.868 --> 05:04:09.878 align:start position:0%
want to say to you I also am not a
 
05:04:12.750 --> 05:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
scientists like Mr Cooper um said he was
 
05:04:14.548 --> 05:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
not and I am not either but I know
 
05:04:16.390 --> 05:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's scientists in the room if you if
 
05:04:19.030 --> 05:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
you need to clarify something I
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
say so the last reason that we um are
 
05:04:24.910 --> 05:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill is because we feel
 
05:04:27.548 --> 05:04:27.558 align:start position:0%
that it serves to address a problem that
 
05:04:30.548 --> 05:04:30.558 align:start position:0%
is still not fully defined by the
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill and we want to
 
05:04:34.628 --> 05:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
know what are the sponsors and the
 
05:04:37.350 --> 05:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
proponents hoping to achieve and let me
 
05:04:41.868 --> 05:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
explain so each year and um Mr arbach
 
05:04:43.390 --> 05:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
talked about which years bills were
 
05:04:45.310 --> 05:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
introduced but many of them came over
 
05:04:48.310 --> 05:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
into subsequent years the New Hampshire
 
05:04:50.788 --> 05:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
legislature has spent many hours and
 
05:04:53.948 --> 05:04:53.958 align:start position:0%
many dollars on attacking essentially 12
 
05:04:56.548 --> 05:04:56.558 align:start position:0%
water districts in New Hampshire that
 
05:04:58.990 --> 05:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
currently adjust their Community Water
 
05:05:02.708 --> 05:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
Supplies to carefully monitored fluoride
 
05:05:06.110 --> 05:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
levels that are chosen or or identified
 
05:05:09.868 --> 05:05:09.878 align:start position:0%
to balance the benefits and um to look
 
05:05:12.750 --> 05:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
them versus the risks of fluoride this
 
05:05:15.948 --> 05:05:15.958 align:start position:0%
does not include so those are hours from
 
05:05:18.270 --> 05:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature this does not include
 
05:05:20.190 --> 05:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
the number of hours spent away from
 
05:05:23.070 --> 05:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
Clinical care and service by dentists
 
05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
physicians dental hygienists nurses um
 
05:05:27.868 --> 05:05:27.878 align:start position:0%
those folks who are here in the room
 
05:05:31.390 --> 05:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
School administrators teachers attorneys
 
05:05:34.190 --> 05:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
um Etc that are here putting their time
 
05:05:36.270 --> 05:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
in to look at this I call this
 
05:05:39.030 --> 05:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
variations we're here again for
 
05:05:41.948 --> 05:05:41.958 align:start position:0%
variation on a theme and what do I mean
 
05:05:43.830 --> 05:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
by that it's been mentioned a couple of
 
05:05:46.670 --> 05:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
times one is this bill has come in one
 
05:05:49.350 --> 05:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
form or another to this committee before
 
05:05:51.628 --> 05:05:51.638 align:start position:0%
we have been to the municipal committee
 
05:05:53.910 --> 05:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
once or twice we have been to the health
 
05:05:57.510 --> 05:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
committee multiple times um and so you
 
05:05:59.548 --> 05:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
know here we are again it's a variation
 
05:06:02.150 --> 05:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:04.670 --> 05:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
theme um in New Hampshire under the
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
local rule residents in those 12 local
 
05:06:10.470 --> 05:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
community Water Systems did vote to put
 
05:06:12.910 --> 05:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
fluoride into their water systems and
 
05:06:15.390 --> 05:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
they adjusted those levels to the Center
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
for Disease Control CDC guidelines um
 
05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
what few members of the legislature or
 
05:06:24.590 --> 05:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
the public know is we don't have just 12
 
05:06:27.310 --> 05:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
water systems and this figure I'm I'm
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
using right now comes from the
 
05:06:31.230 --> 05:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services we
 
05:06:32.430 --> 05:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
have over
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
2500 um Public Water Supplies and um
 
05:06:39.150 --> 05:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
those are some are defined as Community
 
05:06:42.190 --> 05:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
supplies and some as public not a
 
05:06:44.310 --> 05:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
scientist don't know the difference but
 
05:06:46.708 --> 05:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
that number does come from the
 
05:06:49.150 --> 05:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental
 
05:06:51.470 --> 05:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
Services I'm sorry I was a little eager
 
05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
earlier in pointing out that number um
 
05:06:57.430 --> 05:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
these 2500 plus Public Water Systems
 
05:07:00.190 --> 05:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
actually serve municipalities smaller
 
05:07:03.150 --> 05:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
residential communities large workplaces
 
05:07:06.190 --> 05:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
institutions restaurants hotels and
 
05:07:09.910 --> 05:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
campgrounds so since only 12 systems add
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
fluoride you may think that the others
 
05:07:14.110 --> 05:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
are registering
 
05:07:16.670 --> 05:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
0.0 parts per million of
 
05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
fluoride right we only added to 12 the
 
05:07:21.510 --> 05:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
others must have
 
05:07:25.310 --> 05:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
0.0 that is not true and in fact our
 
05:07:27.990 --> 05:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
supplies our um our water supplies are
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
dependent upon bedrock and other than
 
05:07:33.470 --> 05:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
the 12 that um fluoridate all of those
 
05:07:36.830 --> 05:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
other 2500 plus also have a range of
 
05:07:39.548 --> 05:07:39.558 align:start position:0%
fluoride and that range of fluoride May
 
05:07:43.070 --> 05:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
go from um uh
 
05:07:46.470 --> 05:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
0.1 up to over
 
05:07:50.910 --> 05:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
4.0 now 4.0 is five times that CDC
 
05:07:55.310 --> 05:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
number that 7 that's down here Water
 
05:07:57.628 --> 05:07:57.638 align:start position:0%
Supplies in New Hampshire there are many
 
05:08:01.470 --> 05:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
that are up hovering around four okay so
 
05:08:05.948 --> 05:08:05.958 align:start position:0%
so um when the source even at 2.0 that's
 
05:08:08.110 --> 05:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
three times what we consider the optimal
 
05:08:10.788 --> 05:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
level so what I'm saying to you in fact
 
05:08:14.310 --> 05:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
if you're interested um at 2.0 the water
 
05:08:16.548 --> 05:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
system must notify you as the consumer
 
05:08:18.030 --> 05:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
so you may want to go home and check
 
05:08:21.150 --> 05:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
your water system Bill and see if you
 
05:08:23.230 --> 05:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
are in a public or Community water
 
05:08:26.270 --> 05:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
system that is having to notify you of a
 
05:08:30.788 --> 05:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
high higher level than the optimally um
 
05:08:36.150 --> 05:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
recommended one so um 4.0 is when they
 
05:08:38.350 --> 05:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
actually have to take action as a water
 
05:08:41.510 --> 05:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
district and so what happens is that at
 
05:08:44.708 --> 05:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
4.0 what did we say that was five to six
 
05:08:48.030 --> 05:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
times just the CDC level they have to
 
05:08:50.510 --> 05:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
mitigate that and pull that level down
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
how far down do they have to bring it I
 
05:08:55.548 --> 05:08:55.558 align:start position:0%
don't know again I'm not a scientist but
 
05:08:57.430 --> 05:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
all it says is bring it down so I'm
 
05:09:00.788 --> 05:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
going to say 3.9 3.8 3.5 whatever
 
05:09:03.390 --> 05:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
they're not bringing it down to Optimal
 
05:09:06.670 --> 05:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
so if you're following where I'm going
 
05:09:10.670 --> 05:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
the question should be um not if we
 
05:09:13.310 --> 05:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
fluoridate but what do we know about the
 
05:09:16.430 --> 05:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
fluoride in our local Water Systems 2500
 
05:09:18.788 --> 05:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
of them we know an off a lot about 12
 
05:09:20.830 --> 05:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
but what do we know about the others and
 
05:09:23.628 --> 05:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
when do we need to intervene this is a
 
05:09:25.990 --> 05:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
different story than what this spring is
 
05:09:28.150 --> 05:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is bringing forward to you
 
05:09:31.430 --> 05:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
today so let me just say three facts and
 
05:09:35.110 --> 05:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to wrap it up fact of the 2500
 
05:09:37.750 --> 05:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
Public Water Systems in New Hampshire
 
05:09:40.310 --> 05:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
naturally occurring Flor ride measures
 
05:09:45.190 --> 05:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
from 0.1 approximately to over 4.0 far
 
05:09:50.708 --> 05:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
far away from the 7 recommended very few
 
05:09:52.990 --> 05:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
um systems actually naturally hit that
 
05:09:56.430 --> 05:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
sweet spot of 7 so some of them do some
 
05:09:58.510 --> 05:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
hit perfect on
 
05:10:00.788 --> 05:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
optimization fact current state and
 
05:10:03.110 --> 05:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
federal laws only intervene when levels
 
05:10:08.230 --> 05:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
hit 2.0 plus notifying you or 4.0
 
05:10:10.470 --> 05:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
mitigating it down below
 
05:10:14.670 --> 05:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
4.0 okay so fact three wellwater
 
05:10:16.430 --> 05:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
wellwater has been discussed today
 
05:10:18.670 --> 05:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
serves about half of the people of New
 
05:10:21.150 --> 05:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and most of these households
 
05:10:23.470 --> 05:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
have no idea what their natural fluoride
 
05:10:26.430 --> 05:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
level in their well is it's there it's
 
05:10:28.350 --> 05:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
there they just don't know so if you're
 
05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
on a well you can get a test kit and you
 
05:10:34.590 --> 05:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
can find out for your household so um
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
what is the problem that the sponsors of
 
05:10:40.628 --> 05:10:40.638 align:start position:0%
this bill want to solve I am not sure if
 
05:10:44.788 --> 05:10:44.798 align:start position:0%
it's to eliminate the fluoridation of
 
05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
water is it to eliminate fluoride in
 
05:10:53.510 --> 05:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
water not sure um as as we know as we
 
05:10:58.190 --> 05:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
just talked about there's a lot lot 2500
 
05:11:01.110 --> 05:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
that have floridated levels at un
 
05:11:03.548 --> 05:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
currently unmanaged levels the only
 
05:11:07.030 --> 05:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
managed levels are in those 12 water
 
05:11:09.910 --> 05:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
districts so I Leave You with that
 
05:11:12.910 --> 05:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
question um on behalf of my constituents
 
05:11:14.948 --> 05:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
we feel this bill is not ready for
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
discussion because we're not sure what
 
05:11:20.590 --> 05:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get rid of and um we
 
05:11:24.350 --> 05:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
again oppose HB 691 and we request that
 
05:11:27.190 --> 05:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
you go in expedient to legislate thank
 
05:11:30.150 --> 05:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions for the
 
05:11:32.390 --> 05:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
speaker representative Sergeant thank
 
05:11:34.230 --> 05:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and Gail I see your
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
signature has a JD after it so I feel
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
okay ask that I may or may not know
 
05:11:43.708 --> 05:11:43.718 align:start position:0%
fair enough um but I will find out my my
 
05:11:45.230 --> 05:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
thought is and I want to know if you
 
05:11:48.230 --> 05:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
agree or disagree or anything else you
 
05:11:52.510 --> 05:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
think about it okay um so I agree with
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
the prior speaker given the current uh
 
05:11:57.190 --> 05:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
presidency and what's happening that
 
05:11:59.708 --> 05:11:59.718 align:start position:0%
this decision issued in September 24
 
05:12:01.390 --> 05:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
from the federal court out in California
 
05:12:05.070 --> 05:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
will probably not be appealed um fully I
 
05:12:06.350 --> 05:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought of that change in
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
administration until it just pointed out
 
05:12:12.190 --> 05:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
to me um which is unfortunate for me but
 
05:12:15.150 --> 05:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
the judge ruled that the uh EPA has to
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
initiate rulle making on fluide that's
 
05:12:19.110 --> 05:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
the judge's rule that's the standing
 
05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
order then earlier in the decision the
 
05:12:24.750 --> 05:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
judge notes that the EPA is afforded in
 
05:12:26.510 --> 05:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
the first instance the authority to
 
05:12:29.470 --> 05:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
respond and Regulatory actions can range
 
05:12:31.708 --> 05:12:31.718 align:start position:0%
from requiring a mere warning label to
 
05:12:33.990 --> 05:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
Banning the chemical so that's what the
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
EPA is now if this order stands that's
 
05:12:39.628 --> 05:12:39.638 align:start position:0%
what the EPA is going to do is evaluate
 
05:12:42.110 --> 05:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
the range go through rulem which
 
05:12:45.030 --> 05:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
includes public comment do you agree
 
05:12:47.150 --> 05:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
that it would be prudent to hold off on
 
05:12:51.510 --> 05:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
changing our law until that process
 
05:12:53.628 --> 05:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
runs you're
 
05:12:56.708 --> 05:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
tough you're tough I will I will be very
 
05:12:58.628 --> 05:12:58.638 align:start position:0%
honest with you um this is not the part
 
05:13:00.788 --> 05:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
of law that I practice and so I look at
 
05:13:03.430 --> 05:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
systems and I look at regulatory systems
 
05:13:07.310 --> 05:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
what I will say to you very honestly is
 
05:13:10.150 --> 05:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
I feel it would be prudent to hold off
 
05:13:12.470 --> 05:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
till we understand what this bill is
 
05:13:15.390 --> 05:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish and then decide if
 
05:13:17.390 --> 05:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
it is within our scope of what we want
 
05:13:20.990 --> 05:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
to do it's very easy to say 12 systems
 
05:13:23.708 --> 05:13:23.718 align:start position:0%
are the problem um they can stop
 
05:13:23.718 --> 05:13:25.230 align:start position:0%
are the problem um they can stop
fluoridating

05:13:25.230 --> 05:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
fluoridating
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
and um because it's not State money it's
 
05:13:30.350 --> 05:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
easy to say that it's a different
 
05:13:32.350 --> 05:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
question to come forward and say there
 
05:13:35.868 --> 05:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
are 2500 systems and the state wants to
 
05:13:37.788 --> 05:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
take the authority to get the fluoride
 
05:13:40.948 --> 05:13:40.958 align:start position:0%
out I have no idea what that would cost
 
05:13:44.350 --> 05:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
so um I didn't answer your question but
 
05:13:46.830 --> 05:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
I did answer that I think we're not
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
there yet to work on F any other
 
05:13:52.628 --> 05:13:52.638 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
05:13:55.230 --> 05:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
you I don't see any hands thank you very
 
05:13:57.310 --> 05:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony now I'm going to
 
05:14:01.030 --> 05:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
ask if they'd come to the witness table
 
05:14:05.830 --> 05:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
DHHS David GED and Whitney
 
05:14:11.868 --> 05:14:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:14.868 --> 05:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
and we still have uh New Hampshire Dees
 
05:14:17.548 --> 05:14:17.558 align:start position:0%
that will follow and I have no other
 
05:14:29.830 --> 05:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
against hello
 
05:14:35.350 --> 05:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
um my name is Whitney Hammond I'm the
 
05:14:37.110 --> 05:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
deputy director for the division of
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services and I'm joined
 
05:14:42.788 --> 05:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
today I'm Dr David gret I'm a dental
 
05:14:46.750 --> 05:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:50.350 --> 05:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
unit um so I want to I'll quickly go
 
05:14:51.990 --> 05:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
over the things I wanted to cover and
 
05:14:53.670 --> 05:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
then hopefully leave time for any
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
questions that may have come up
 
05:14:57.390 --> 05:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of
 
05:15:00.510 --> 05:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
testimony um I wanted to First just
 
05:15:03.110 --> 05:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
address and give context to dental decay
 
05:15:05.868 --> 05:15:05.878 align:start position:0%
as an issue in New Hampshire so I heard
 
05:15:07.670 --> 05:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
some reference to that we have the
 
05:15:09.708 --> 05:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
lowest rate of dental care you know
 
05:15:12.430 --> 05:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
compared to other states um there was
 
05:15:13.990 --> 05:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
some talk about is this a children's
 
05:15:17.070 --> 05:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
issue or an adult issue so I just I came
 
05:15:19.470 --> 05:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
with data that our department collects
 
05:15:21.310 --> 05:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
um just to give a little bit of context
 
05:15:23.868 --> 05:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
so Dental carries are pretty much one of
 
05:15:26.390 --> 05:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
the most important significant chronic
 
05:15:29.510 --> 05:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
diseases among children in New Hampshire
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
uh around 59% of children right now in
 
05:15:36.390 --> 05:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
the state have dental decay um and a
 
05:15:38.110 --> 05:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
number of those individuals have
 
05:15:41.310 --> 05:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
untreated dent Decay which can lead to
 
05:15:43.230 --> 05:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
lots of different consequences I don't
 
05:15:44.628 --> 05:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
know if any of you have had the
 
05:15:47.230 --> 05:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
experience but it can be quite painful
 
05:15:49.470 --> 05:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
it can make chewing difficult it can
 
05:15:51.150 --> 05:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
make it difficult for a child to pay
 
05:15:55.030 --> 05:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
attention in school um and so it is very
 
05:15:59.190 --> 05:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
much an active issue in New Hampshire um
 
05:16:00.350 --> 05:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I think is
 
05:16:02.670 --> 05:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
important I too have been here many
 
05:16:05.830 --> 05:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
times testifying on similar legislation
 
05:16:08.548 --> 05:16:08.558 align:start position:0%
and it's sad to have to say but the
 
05:16:11.150 --> 05:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
dental Decay rate has increased markedly
 
05:16:13.708 --> 05:16:13.718 align:start position:0%
since the last time I came and testified
 
05:16:17.190 --> 05:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
it was down around 35% for our kids and
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
we really saw a change in that carries
 
05:16:22.030 --> 05:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
rate during covid when access to care
 
05:16:24.990 --> 05:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
was uh diminished for everybody in the
 
05:16:27.750 --> 05:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
State uh in addition we know that Dental
 
05:16:30.070 --> 05:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
carries are an issue for our adults in
 
05:16:32.270 --> 05:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
the state um so people may not have
 
05:16:35.110 --> 05:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
awareness that around 40% of adults in
 
05:16:37.230 --> 05:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have lost up to six of
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
their teeth due to untreat dental decay
 
05:16:43.548 --> 05:16:43.558 align:start position:0%
and uh topical fluoride and systemic
 
05:16:45.430 --> 05:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
fluoride which I'll go into a little bit
 
05:16:48.868 --> 05:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
of the differences um are both connected
 
05:16:50.948 --> 05:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
with preventing that kind of tooth loss
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
so uh and then it's around 12% of adults
 
05:16:55.788 --> 05:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that have complete
 
05:16:58.708 --> 05:16:58.718 align:start position:0%
total tooth loss um which is another
 
05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
thing at risk when you talk about
 
05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
removing Community water
 
05:17:05.350 --> 05:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
fluoridation um a number of people have
 
05:17:07.110 --> 05:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
touched on it so I won't go too much
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
into it um just to say that community
 
05:17:10.910 --> 05:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation is a wellestablished
 
05:17:14.110 --> 05:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
strategy with 80 years worth of evidence
 
05:17:16.510 --> 05:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
to show that it is safe at the optimal
 
05:17:18.990 --> 05:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
levels there was some reference earlier
 
05:17:20.990 --> 05:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
to a lack of what are called randomized
 
05:17:23.270 --> 05:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
controlled trials um related to the
 
05:17:26.350 --> 05:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
health uh effects and safety uh
 
05:17:28.910 --> 05:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
fortunately we don't need rcts because
 
05:17:30.788 --> 05:17:30.798 align:start position:0%
we have real life evidence from
 
05:17:33.190 --> 05:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
populations that have had exposure to
 
05:17:35.590 --> 05:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
fluoride people may not be aware of the
 
05:17:37.510 --> 05:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
history of how we came to fluoridating
 
05:17:39.990 --> 05:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
Water Systems but it was actually
 
05:17:42.310 --> 05:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
through population studies and
 
05:17:45.270 --> 05:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
epidemiology where back in the 1930s
 
05:17:47.510 --> 05:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
dentists started to identify communities
 
05:17:49.590 --> 05:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
that had far lower levels of dental
 
05:17:52.270 --> 05:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
decay and they also started to identify
 
05:17:54.788 --> 05:17:54.798 align:start position:0%
fosis which led them down the path of
 
05:17:57.030 --> 05:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
saying this is an effective intervention
 
05:17:59.830 --> 05:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
for arresting tooth decay uh so no there
 
05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
are not rcts because there's broad
 
05:18:05.070 --> 05:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
population data which is a much more uh
 
05:18:08.910 --> 05:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
expansive data set than any RCT could be
 
05:18:11.230 --> 05:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
um cost has come up a little bit and I
 
05:18:13.390 --> 05:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
know I'm joined here um to talk a little
 
05:18:15.150 --> 05:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
bit about the fiscal note worksheet that
 
05:18:18.628 --> 05:18:18.638 align:start position:0%
accompanied this um part of why Public
 
05:18:20.510 --> 05:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
Health has promoted Community water
 
05:18:22.788 --> 05:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
fluoridation as one of our like most
 
05:18:25.270 --> 05:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
impactful um strategies in the last
 
05:18:27.788 --> 05:18:27.798 align:start position:0%
century is because it's so incredibly
 
05:18:30.548 --> 05:18:30.558 align:start position:0%
cost effective so for every dollar a
 
05:18:32.590 --> 05:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
community invests in community water
 
05:18:35.350 --> 05:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
floration there's an estimated $20
 
05:18:39.310 --> 05:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
Savings in Downstream treatment um
 
05:18:40.788 --> 05:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
I can talk I will talk a little bit
 
05:18:42.510 --> 05:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
about what uh the division of Public
 
05:18:44.190 --> 05:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
Health Services does in terms of
 
05:18:45.670 --> 05:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
providing fluoride to children in
 
05:18:49.390 --> 05:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
schools but it's suffice to say much
 
05:18:52.070 --> 05:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
more costly to be applying individual
 
05:18:54.510 --> 05:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
fluoride treatment to children's
 
05:18:57.868 --> 05:18:57.878 align:start position:0%
teeth um I do want to talk a little bit
 
05:18:59.470 --> 05:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
I I haven't heard as much around the
 
05:19:01.590 --> 05:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
differences between topical and systemic
 
05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
fluoride application I won't go into the
 
05:19:07.470 --> 05:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
science um a lot but it's just to say
 
05:19:09.590 --> 05:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
fluoride isn't naturally occurring
 
05:19:12.150 --> 05:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
mineral um and part of the mechanism
 
05:19:14.310 --> 05:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
that it uses is to actually so when you
 
05:19:17.070 --> 05:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
do topical fluoride application that can
 
05:19:19.270 --> 05:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
be through toothpaste mouthwash but then
 
05:19:21.750 --> 05:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of clinical procedures so we have
 
05:19:23.830 --> 05:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
Fluoride Varnish we have silver diamine
 
05:19:25.350 --> 05:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
fluoride so there are lots of different
 
05:19:28.230 --> 05:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
ways to put fluoride onto a tooth and it
 
05:19:31.230 --> 05:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
strengthens it it mineralizes it that's
 
05:19:33.868 --> 05:19:33.878 align:start position:0%
topical uh systemic fluoride which
 
05:19:35.788 --> 05:19:35.798 align:start position:0%
nobody has mentioned I don't think today
 
05:19:37.030 --> 05:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
but there are two ways you can get
 
05:19:39.070 --> 05:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
systemic fluoride one is through the
 
05:19:39.080 --> 05:19:39.910 align:start position:0%
systemic fluoride one is through the
water

05:19:39.910 --> 05:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:19:41.990 --> 05:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
fluoridation um people have also not
 
05:19:43.510 --> 05:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned but bottled water is
 
05:19:45.948 --> 05:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
fluoridated in this country and then all
 
05:19:47.868 --> 05:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
of the products that are produced using
 
05:19:52.470 --> 05:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
fluoridated water are fluoridated juices
 
05:19:57.310 --> 05:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
alcohol um so it's uh broadly in things
 
05:20:00.390 --> 05:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
um the systemic fluoride actually helps
 
05:20:03.750 --> 05:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
to strengthen teeth it does topical so
 
05:20:05.310 --> 05:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
when you're drinking the water it's
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
topically treating your tooth as well as
 
05:20:09.708 --> 05:20:09.718 align:start position:0%
it is for children and very effective in
 
05:20:11.990 --> 05:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
helping to build up the strength of the
 
05:20:14.708 --> 05:20:14.718 align:start position:0%
teeth that have yet to emerge um so it
 
05:20:16.910 --> 05:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
is very different um the other systemic
 
05:20:18.910 --> 05:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
fluoride option would be tablets which
 
05:20:20.990 --> 05:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about the cost that
 
05:20:22.990 --> 05:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid projects around having to
 
05:20:25.590 --> 05:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
provide systemic fluide to Children
 
05:20:27.430 --> 05:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
through prescriptions from their health
 
05:20:27.440 --> 05:20:30.030 align:start position:0%
through prescriptions from their health
care

05:20:30.030 --> 05:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:32.270 --> 05:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
providers the last thing I wanted to
 
05:20:35.110 --> 05:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
just highlight is um New Hampshire is
 
05:20:37.070 --> 05:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
not unique in regard to our Healthcare
 
05:20:39.990 --> 05:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages um and there are
 
05:20:41.948 --> 05:20:41.958 align:start position:0%
incredible challenges in terms of
 
05:20:45.190 --> 05:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
Staffing primary care and dental offices
 
05:20:47.830 --> 05:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen a 7% decrease in the number
 
05:20:50.230 --> 05:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
of dentists in the state while we've
 
05:20:52.230 --> 05:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
seen an increase in the number of people
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
with dental insurance um you know partly
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
through the expansion of the Medicaid
 
05:20:58.670 --> 05:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
benefit to include adult
 
05:21:01.990 --> 05:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
Dental um so there would be concerns
 
05:21:04.548 --> 05:21:04.558 align:start position:0%
over even the capacity of the dental
 
05:21:07.230 --> 05:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
Workforce to be able to serve uh the
 
05:21:09.070 --> 05:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
increased number of children who don't
 
05:21:11.190 --> 05:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
benefit and adults who don't benefit
 
05:21:11.200 --> 05:21:12.230 align:start position:0%
benefit and adults who don't benefit
from

05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:21:12.240 --> 05:21:14.470 align:start position:0%
from
fluoride

05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
fluoride
 
05:21:17.990 --> 05:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that is good for me did you
 
05:21:19.990 --> 05:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
have anything did we did submit a fiscal
 
05:21:22.270 --> 05:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
note worksheet I don't know if people um
 
05:21:25.708 --> 05:21:25.718 align:start position:0%
have particular questions around that
 
05:21:28.910 --> 05:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
um and it breaks down the cost that we
 
05:21:31.750 --> 05:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
would anticipate for those tablets I'm
 
05:21:34.830 --> 05:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions is the
 
05:21:36.390 --> 05:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
doctor going to say anything did you
 
05:21:38.990 --> 05:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
want to add anything yes please we start
 
05:21:40.830 --> 05:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
doing questions thank you thank you
 
05:21:44.190 --> 05:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'd like I'd like to start
 
05:21:47.190 --> 05:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
with the with the water fluoridation um
 
05:21:50.150 --> 05:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
people that are affected and in the
 
05:21:52.470 --> 05:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
approximately 17 communities that we
 
05:21:54.430 --> 05:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
have that have the water of fluoridation
 
05:21:57.430 --> 05:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
there are almost 25,000 children under
 
05:21:58.510 --> 05:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
the age of
 
05:22:02.310 --> 05:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
12 and it is this type of systemic um
 
05:22:05.110 --> 05:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
intake of fluoride that it is the most
 
05:22:07.628 --> 05:22:07.638 align:start position:0%
potential the most effective at
 
05:22:10.350 --> 05:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
preventing dental disease from Decay
 
05:22:14.150 --> 05:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
standpoint um than than adults uh and a
 
05:22:16.868 --> 05:22:16.878 align:start position:0%
situation if fluoride can be in contact
 
05:22:19.310 --> 05:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
as the teeth are growing and developing
 
05:22:21.948 --> 05:22:21.958 align:start position:0%
they become more resistant to Decay so
 
05:22:25.270 --> 05:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's crucial for these 25,000 children
 
05:22:28.670 --> 05:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
and that's only up until age 12 uh
 
05:22:30.510 --> 05:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
beyond that we have another almost
 
05:22:34.430 --> 05:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
46,000 residents um between the ages of
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
13 and above um that Medicaid covers and
 
05:22:42.030 --> 05:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
and protects um we are expecting a
 
05:22:44.750 --> 05:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
significant change in prescriptions for
 
05:22:46.868 --> 05:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
fluoride if the kids are not going to be
 
05:22:49.310 --> 05:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
getting the fluoride through their water
 
05:22:50.350 --> 05:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
then it's going to be done by
 
05:22:52.030 --> 05:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
prescription and it's done by
 
05:22:53.910 --> 05:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
prescription by your dentist or by your
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
physician because that is the standard
 
05:22:59.548 --> 05:22:59.558 align:start position:0%
of practice so if fluoride is eliminated
 
05:23:01.990 --> 05:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
from the from the patient uh they will
 
05:23:05.150 --> 05:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
be added through prescriptions uh and
 
05:23:07.350 --> 05:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
considering that is expected to be
 
05:23:09.070 --> 05:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 15
 
05:23:10.628 --> 05:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
per person per
 
05:23:12.830 --> 05:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
month so we're looking at a very
 
05:23:14.788 --> 05:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
significant increase just in
 
05:23:16.830 --> 05:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
prescription writing or in in filling
 
05:23:19.788 --> 05:23:19.798 align:start position:0%
the prescriptions for an oral
 
05:23:22.270 --> 05:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
fluoride uh again the the department
 
05:23:23.628 --> 05:23:23.638 align:start position:0%
provides support for the school and
 
05:23:25.788 --> 05:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
Community Based Dental Programs that
 
05:23:27.310 --> 05:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
provide prevention and treatment for
 
05:23:29.230 --> 05:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
dental decay it's assumed that the
 
05:23:31.270 --> 05:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
dental Department could not increase
 
05:23:34.230 --> 05:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
funding to these areas who when the
 
05:23:37.590 --> 05:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
fluoride is ceased um from adding to the
 
05:23:41.830 --> 05:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
water due to funding uh constraints so a
 
05:23:44.670 --> 05:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
situation where it is anticipated that
 
05:23:46.788 --> 05:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
there will be somewhere between 1 and $3
 
05:23:49.350 --> 05:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
million in additional expenses if the
 
05:23:51.910 --> 05:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
floration is
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
removed all I have any questions for
 
05:23:55.548 --> 05:23:55.558 align:start position:0%
either of our
 
05:23:57.708 --> 05:23:57.718 align:start position:0%
speakers representative
 
05:24:01.110 --> 05:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
Donnelly then representative Darby thank
 
05:24:02.910 --> 05:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
you chair um thank you for taking my
 
05:24:04.948 --> 05:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned that um all
 
05:24:07.310 --> 05:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
products all bottled waters all things
 
05:24:09.910 --> 05:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
that we drink contain fluoride in that
 
05:24:11.670 --> 05:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
and I was just reading online that that
 
05:24:13.310 --> 05:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
they came back and it said that wasn't
 
05:24:14.708 --> 05:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
necessarily true do you have any
 
05:24:18.030 --> 05:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
evidence of that um and can you provide
 
05:24:21.548 --> 05:24:21.558 align:start position:0%
backup to that yeah sorry if I said all
 
05:24:23.670 --> 05:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
um products are fluoridated that was not
 
05:24:26.190 --> 05:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
my intention many bottled waters are
 
05:24:28.150 --> 05:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
fluoridated and the division of Public
 
05:24:30.788 --> 05:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
Health actually tests bottled water for
 
05:24:32.510 --> 05:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know different concentrations and
 
05:24:34.670 --> 05:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
then again if you if something's
 
05:24:37.070 --> 05:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
manufactured using water that's
 
05:24:41.868 --> 05:24:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:43.910 --> 05:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
floridated thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:24:46.190 --> 05:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question on related note
 
05:24:46.200 --> 05:24:47.190 align:start position:0%
for taking my question on related note
um

05:24:47.190 --> 05:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:50.310 --> 05:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
for um going back to that uh lawsuit
 
05:24:52.470 --> 05:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's been U discussed a couple of
 
05:24:55.590 --> 05:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
times um does as far as you know does
 
05:24:57.750 --> 05:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
that only apply to community water
 
05:25:00.510 --> 05:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
systems and not um bottled water that
 
05:25:01.868 --> 05:25:01.878 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:25:04.990 --> 05:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
fluoridated yeah so fluoride is an
 
05:25:07.350 --> 05:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
interesting just thing in general
 
05:25:08.628 --> 05:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
because it's regulated by by two
 
05:25:11.230 --> 05:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
different agencies depending on where
 
05:25:14.390 --> 05:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's being used so FDA regulates bottled
 
05:25:18.510 --> 05:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
water because that's food and then EPA
 
05:25:19.990 --> 05:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
regulates the community water
 
05:25:22.470 --> 05:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
fluoridation system so it's and they
 
05:25:25.070 --> 05:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
have different standards of how they
 
05:25:29.430 --> 05:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
assess um and make decisions EPA does
 
05:25:31.548 --> 05:25:31.558 align:start position:0%
not assess for health benefit they focus
 
05:25:35.868 --> 05:25:35.878 align:start position:0%
on health risk and FDA balances
 
05:25:40.110 --> 05:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
both do we have any other questions
 
05:25:42.830 --> 05:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh I just have one if I might just for
 
05:25:45.190 --> 05:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
the record I've read quickly your
 
05:25:48.830 --> 05:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
testimony normally I see a spec
 
05:25:52.948 --> 05:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
specification are you opposed are you in
 
05:25:56.708 --> 05:25:56.718 align:start position:0%
favor or do you take no position as the
 
05:25:59.030 --> 05:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
department on the bill I just wanted to
 
05:26:00.910 --> 05:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
get it on record yeah we're providing
 
05:26:03.708 --> 05:26:03.718 align:start position:0%
we're here to provide information and to
 
05:26:05.628 --> 05:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
just Express serious concerns about the
 
05:26:09.628 --> 05:26:09.638 align:start position:0%
impact on oral health and cost thank you
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
well thank you both appreciate that uh
 
05:26:16.070 --> 05:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
next up New Hampshire Dees Brandon Karan
 
05:26:18.868 --> 05:26:18.878 align:start position:0%
and Karen I can't read your last name
 
05:26:21.990 --> 05:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
creeper thank
 
05:26:25.030 --> 05:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
you and they have written testimony and
 
05:26:34.190 --> 05:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:36.830 --> 05:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
had well the testimon is being passed
 
05:26:38.708 --> 05:26:38.718 align:start position:0%
out if you don't mind me just ask asking
 
05:26:40.628 --> 05:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else that wants to fill
 
05:26:41.910 --> 05:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
out a pin
 
05:26:45.310 --> 05:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
card so I'll know if I get any coming I
 
05:26:49.310 --> 05:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
don't see any more thank you Mr Karen
 
05:26:50.830 --> 05:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:26:52.270 --> 05:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Brandon kernin I'm the
 
05:26:53.470 --> 05:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
administrator of the drinking water and
 
05:26:55.310 --> 05:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
groundwater Bureau I'm here with Karen
 
05:26:56.830 --> 05:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
Craver who's the administrator of the
 
05:26:59.750 --> 05:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
environmental health program at Dees and
 
05:27:01.310 --> 05:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
we're really here to provide some
 
05:27:02.750 --> 05:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
background information and answer
 
05:27:05.150 --> 05:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
questions we're not taking a specific
 
05:27:07.788 --> 05:27:07.798 align:start position:0%
position on the bill today I think as
 
05:27:09.390 --> 05:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
you've heard currently state law has a
 
05:27:12.430 --> 05:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
very good process for communities to put
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
in fluoridation or to abolish it um this
 
05:27:17.910 --> 05:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill would dismantle that process and
 
05:27:20.510 --> 05:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit fluoridation
 
05:27:22.628 --> 05:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
Statewide I want to just point out from
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
our standpoint of Department we're aware
 
05:27:26.708 --> 05:27:26.718 align:start position:0%
of the optimal recommendations for
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
florid drinking water to for its great
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
benefit for oral health um to be at a
 
05:27:34.470 --> 05:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
concentration of7 milligrams per liter
 
05:27:35.990 --> 05:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
and we have rules and procedures in
 
05:27:38.190 --> 05:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
place to ensure water systems are
 
05:27:40.548 --> 05:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
monitoring that daily and then providing
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
information to the state so that we have
 
05:27:45.070 --> 05:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
oversight to ensure that that system of
 
05:27:47.430 --> 05:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
putting fluoridation in the water is is
 
05:27:49.788 --> 05:27:49.798 align:start position:0%
hitting those optimal levels and so it's
 
05:27:51.830 --> 05:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
a very good process to to support the
 
05:27:55.708 --> 05:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
fluoridation um efforts in the State uh
 
05:27:59.310 --> 05:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
we do regulate fluoride for 1500 Public
 
05:28:01.830 --> 05:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
Water Systems there are 2500 there's
 
05:28:03.470 --> 05:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
three categories there's are Community
 
05:28:05.910 --> 05:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
Water Systems um which is like city of
 
05:28:08.190 --> 05:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester Port Smith or it could be uh
 
05:28:10.190 --> 05:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
a Condominium Association where people
 
05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
live essentially and and get their water
 
05:28:15.310 --> 05:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
they have to regularly test their water
 
05:28:17.590 --> 05:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
for fluoride um there's non Community
 
05:28:19.830 --> 05:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
non-transient Water Systems that's a
 
05:28:22.070 --> 05:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
place like a school or a place of work
 
05:28:23.350 --> 05:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
where the same people go to the same
 
05:28:24.708 --> 05:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
place and drink the same water on a
 
05:28:26.430 --> 05:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
regular basis they have to test for
 
05:28:29.350 --> 05:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
fluoride on a regular basis and then
 
05:28:30.670 --> 05:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
there's the what we call the transient
 
05:28:32.910 --> 05:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
water system so that's about a thousand
 
05:28:34.270 --> 05:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
water systems and that might be like a
 
05:28:36.190 --> 05:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
fast food place where different people
 
05:28:37.750 --> 05:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
drinking the water every day and they do
 
05:28:40.190 --> 05:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
not have to test off for f because
 
05:28:42.830 --> 05:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's it's a chronic exposure concern
 
05:28:45.110 --> 05:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
and so the regulations don't apply to
 
05:28:47.910 --> 05:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
those systems and I'm happy to say that
 
05:28:49.510 --> 05:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
all the all the systems that do have to
 
05:28:51.750 --> 05:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
test for Florida and state comply with
 
05:28:53.430 --> 05:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
the drinking water standards of four
 
05:28:55.150 --> 05:28:55.160 align:start position:0%
milligrams per liter they're below that
 
05:28:57.310 --> 05:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
at this point we don't have a lot of
 
05:28:58.830 --> 05:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
systems that exceed that but there is
 
05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
sort of a belt in the Tamworth Bartle
 
05:29:02.708 --> 05:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
Conway area where there's a number of
 
05:29:04.788 --> 05:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
very small community water systems that
 
05:29:06.590 --> 05:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
have exceedances and have to put in
 
05:29:08.470 --> 05:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
treatment um which can be somewhat
 
05:29:10.150 --> 05:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
complicated for fluide but they're doing
 
05:29:10.160 --> 05:29:11.350 align:start position:0%
complicated for fluide but they're doing
that

05:29:11.350 --> 05:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:29:13.350 --> 05:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
successfully I just want to point out
 
05:29:15.750 --> 05:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
that as an agency we constantly are
 
05:29:18.270 --> 05:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
tracking the best science around all
 
05:29:19.670 --> 05:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
contaminants and looking for
 
05:29:22.548 --> 05:29:22.558 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed consensus information and
 
05:29:24.990 --> 05:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
we continue to do that we are very much
 
05:29:27.910 --> 05:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
aware of the EPA Court ruling which
 
05:29:29.990 --> 05:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
really just tells EPA to go back and
 
05:29:32.030 --> 05:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
assess risk there's a lot of lot of on
 
05:29:35.110 --> 05:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
Liners in that that finding including
 
05:29:36.830 --> 05:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
that this ruling doesn't really find
 
05:29:38.548 --> 05:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
that fluid has been injured to Public
 
05:29:40.830 --> 05:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
Health but it does say it needs EPA
 
05:29:43.230 --> 05:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
needs to look at risk and potentially
 
05:29:46.190 --> 05:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
regulate or respond to that risk and so
 
05:29:47.430 --> 05:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's not a terrible thing to ask
 
05:29:49.230 --> 05:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
someone to look at the science again and
 
05:29:51.350 --> 05:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
Report out and so no matter if the
 
05:29:53.390 --> 05:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
rulings appealed or not it doesn't
 
05:29:54.830 --> 05:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
immediately affect us because it's what
 
05:29:56.830 --> 05:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
we would want EPA to do to be looking at
 
05:29:59.510 --> 05:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
the best science and and updating any
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
assessments and I don't know if you
 
05:30:03.990 --> 05:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
anything you want to add no I think
 
05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
Brendan pretty much covered it um you
 
05:30:07.590 --> 05:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
know I mean at the federal level and
 
05:30:09.628 --> 05:30:09.638 align:start position:0%
then ALS so at the state level I'm here
 
05:30:11.390 --> 05:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
representing I'm here representing the
 
05:30:12.788 --> 05:30:12.798 align:start position:0%
state level the environmental health
 
05:30:14.350 --> 05:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
program but we are tasked with risk
 
05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
assessors and toxicologists and there is
 
05:30:19.030 --> 05:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
a process for assessing risk of
 
05:30:22.390 --> 05:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
chemicals um like fluoride and in in
 
05:30:24.230 --> 05:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
that risk assessment process we are
 
05:30:25.510 --> 05:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
tasked with considering the most
 
05:30:27.990 --> 05:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population to select a level
 
05:30:30.030 --> 05:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
that's protective of the most vulnerable
 
05:30:32.548 --> 05:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
population so as Brandon noted the the
 
05:30:34.270 --> 05:30:34.280 align:start position:0%
maximum contaminant level for
 
05:30:37.150 --> 05:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
fluoridation or for fluoride is is 4
 
05:30:39.110 --> 05:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
milligrams per L secondary Max
 
05:30:40.830 --> 05:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
contaminant of 2 milligrams per liter
 
05:30:42.030 --> 05:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
and that's where that notification
 
05:30:44.948 --> 05:30:44.958 align:start position:0%
occurs and the optimization level is far
 
05:30:46.708 --> 05:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
below that at
 
05:30:49.628 --> 05:30:49.638 align:start position:0%
point7 thank you any questions for these
 
05:30:52.670 --> 05:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
speakers representative Ryan then
 
05:30:55.150 --> 05:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
representative ghou thank you for Mr
 
05:30:56.430 --> 05:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:30:58.830 --> 05:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
question if a community receives
 
05:31:00.990 --> 05:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
fluoride in their water now and they
 
05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
decide to have a vote to not receive
 
05:31:05.430 --> 05:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
fluide anymore is there a process in
 
05:31:07.708 --> 05:31:07.718 align:start position:0%
place to stop that from happening for
 
05:31:07.718 --> 05:31:09.470 align:start position:0%
place to stop that from happening for
them

05:31:09.470 --> 05:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:31:11.948 --> 05:31:11.958 align:start position:0%
yes the statute has a process for either
 
05:31:14.230 --> 05:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
putting in fluoridation or abolishing it
 
05:31:15.868 --> 05:31:15.878 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the same process it depends
 
05:31:19.990 --> 05:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
if you're a a village District um a town
 
05:31:21.910 --> 05:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
or a city the number of signatures for a
 
05:31:23.230 --> 05:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
petition to get it on the ballot and
 
05:31:24.910 --> 05:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
then there's a vote and so you can
 
05:31:26.948 --> 05:31:26.958 align:start position:0%
abolish it the same way it's put in it's
 
05:31:28.470 --> 05:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
only allowed to be reconsidered once
 
05:31:30.470 --> 05:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
every three years um so it can't be done
 
05:31:32.310 --> 05:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
over and over again but that there is a
 
05:31:34.788 --> 05:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
standing process to abolish
 
05:31:40.070 --> 05:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:45.670 --> 05:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:49.430 --> 05:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
me um you have a sentence uh on the
 
05:31:52.230 --> 05:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
second page due to naturally occurring
 
05:31:54.788 --> 05:31:54.798 align:start position:0%
fluoride this means that systems that
 
05:31:57.070 --> 05:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
practice Community water
 
05:31:59.430 --> 05:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
fluoridation may have lower levels of
 
05:32:01.990 --> 05:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
fluoride in the drinking water than
 
05:32:05.070 --> 05:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
systems that do not actively practice
 
05:32:06.990 --> 05:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
fluoridation could you explain that a
 
05:32:08.910 --> 05:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
05:32:11.230 --> 05:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
yes so for a system that's adding
 
05:32:13.868 --> 05:32:13.878 align:start position:0%
fluoride they would have 7 milligrams
 
05:32:15.390 --> 05:32:15.400 align:start position:0%
per liter fluoride and that's carefully
 
05:32:18.430 --> 05:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
monitored daily by certified operators
 
05:32:19.628 --> 05:32:19.638 align:start position:0%
but then within the state we have
 
05:32:21.708 --> 05:32:21.718 align:start position:0%
naturally occurring fluoride mostly in
 
05:32:24.310 --> 05:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
Bedrock again mostly not entirely but
 
05:32:26.670 --> 05:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
mostly in that Bartlett Tamworth Conway
 
05:32:29.548 --> 05:32:29.558 align:start position:0%
area and fluoride in those Wells could
 
05:32:31.270 --> 05:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
be over two could be over four if
 
05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
they're over four they have to implement
 
05:32:35.548 --> 05:32:35.558 align:start position:0%
treatment or corrective action and and
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
we have a few that do that so that one
 
05:32:39.070 --> 05:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
ones that aren't adding fluoride might
 
05:32:41.150 --> 05:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
have it just from the the geology
 
05:32:43.548 --> 05:32:43.558 align:start position:0%
they're drawing their water
 
05:32:45.270 --> 05:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
from thank
 
05:32:48.948 --> 05:32:48.958 align:start position:0%
you followup are you all set I guess
 
05:32:51.070 --> 05:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
representative is all set representative
 
05:32:53.110 --> 05:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
NAB thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:32:54.830 --> 05:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um there was a
 
05:32:56.310 --> 05:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
comment made earlier about the different
 
05:32:58.708 --> 05:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
types of compounds added or different
 
05:33:00.830 --> 05:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
variations of fluoride added and you
 
05:33:02.628 --> 05:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
list some of them in this chart can you
 
05:33:05.230 --> 05:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
speak to the difference between one of
 
05:33:08.910 --> 05:33:08.920 align:start position:0%
them and a naturally occurring
 
05:33:11.070 --> 05:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
they're just forms of fluoride that have
 
05:33:14.030 --> 05:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
been processed to be very pure and food
 
05:33:16.628 --> 05:33:16.638 align:start position:0%
grade and combined so that they mix with
 
05:33:19.390 --> 05:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
water very effectively and so you you
 
05:33:20.510 --> 05:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
just wouldn't want to take plain
 
05:33:22.110 --> 05:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
fluoride and plop it in water it
 
05:33:24.548 --> 05:33:24.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't dissolve appropriately so it's
 
05:33:26.230 --> 05:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
a it's a way that you can dose at these
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
very low levels consistently and
 
05:33:32.230 --> 05:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
effectively and again although all
 
05:33:34.708 --> 05:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
compounds come from somewhere a lot of
 
05:33:37.070 --> 05:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
things including medicine um come from
 
05:33:38.948 --> 05:33:38.958 align:start position:0%
odd places but they're highly processed
 
05:33:40.670 --> 05:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
and become highly pure before they're
 
05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
used for food additives or drinking
 
05:33:45.430 --> 05:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
water additives thank you and it's all
 
05:33:51.030 --> 05:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:53.230 --> 05:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
way yeah I would be surprised
 
05:33:55.150 --> 05:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
representative Darby representative
 
05:33:57.868 --> 05:33:57.878 align:start position:0%
Darby go ahead I was watching but I've
 
05:33:59.788 --> 05:33:59.798 align:start position:0%
been very quiet today you've been very
 
05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
good today thank you so much for taking
 
05:34:05.270 --> 05:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
my question um I I think I heard that
 
05:34:08.868 --> 05:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
you said that um uh you you consider the
 
05:34:10.830 --> 05:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
health risks to the most vulnerable
 
05:34:15.190 --> 05:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
populations and so you know um we we saw
 
05:34:17.190 --> 05:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
earlier that there's a statement that
 
05:34:20.990 --> 05:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
has to go out on um as part of some RSA
 
05:34:26.510 --> 05:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
that says um not to give uh um bottle or
 
05:34:29.350 --> 05:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
sorry water that's been treated um to
 
05:34:32.350 --> 05:34:32.360 align:start position:0%
infants um in if they drink a lot of uh
 
05:34:34.190 --> 05:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
formula or something like that so I
 
05:34:35.948 --> 05:34:35.958 align:start position:0%
would assume that that means that they
 
05:34:37.868 --> 05:34:37.878 align:start position:0%
this was the this was in one of the
 
05:34:39.390 --> 05:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
handouts we received I think maybe you
 
05:34:41.868 --> 05:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
heard the testimony on it um so that
 
05:34:43.628 --> 05:34:43.638 align:start position:0%
mean makes me think that probably under
 
05:34:45.510 --> 05:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
six months is one of these most
 
05:34:47.390 --> 05:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations and can you talk
 
05:34:52.990 --> 05:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
about about um the risk of um you know s
 
05:34:56.070 --> 05:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
um parts per million um to that uh you
 
05:34:57.990 --> 05:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
know that infant
 
05:35:00.230 --> 05:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
population so I can try to answer this
 
05:35:01.788 --> 05:35:01.798 align:start position:0%
but I'll preface it by saying that I'm
 
05:35:03.548 --> 05:35:03.558 align:start position:0%
not a toxicologist and I'm not a risk
 
05:35:05.030 --> 05:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
assessor I'm the administrator of the
 
05:35:06.390 --> 05:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
environmental health program and so I
 
05:35:07.910 --> 05:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
have a team and I'm happy to bring those
 
05:35:11.150 --> 05:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
question back to them but um I think
 
05:35:13.628 --> 05:35:13.638 align:start position:0%
generally speaking when we're setting
 
05:35:14.750 --> 05:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
health or making health-based
 
05:35:16.230 --> 05:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations for environmental
 
05:35:18.230 --> 05:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
quality standards pregnant women and
 
05:35:20.590 --> 05:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
young children and infants are are those
 
05:35:23.510 --> 05:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations that we consider
 
05:35:25.910 --> 05:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
um and my point in raising that before
 
05:35:28.430 --> 05:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
was to say that the the actual um
 
05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
standard that has been set for floride
 
05:35:33.708 --> 05:35:33.718 align:start position:0%
is much higher than the point s um it's
 
05:35:35.990 --> 05:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's four parts per million where you
 
05:35:38.110 --> 05:35:38.120 align:start position:0%
where you might expect to see um
 
05:35:39.948 --> 05:35:39.958 align:start position:0%
negative Health impacts two parts per
 
05:35:43.830 --> 05:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
million where you see um like cosmetic
 
05:35:46.310 --> 05:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
cosmetic impacts and then point seven
 
05:35:48.670 --> 05:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
where we would see a health
 
05:35:51.750 --> 05:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
benefit follow up okay thank you very
 
05:35:53.230 --> 05:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
much for that thank you Mr chair thank
 
05:35:55.270 --> 05:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
you very much for that so just you know
 
05:35:58.628 --> 05:35:58.638 align:start position:0%
just being explicit here um you have
 
05:36:00.548 --> 05:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
some Public Health uh some public water
 
05:36:04.510 --> 05:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
supply that tests set you know three um
 
05:36:07.150 --> 05:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh five times at 3.7 uh parts per
 
05:36:10.350 --> 05:36:10.360 align:start position:0%
million you're um and that's going in uh
 
05:36:14.788 --> 05:36:14.798 align:start position:0%
for example um formula and um you know
 
05:36:16.868 --> 05:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
mothers that are breastfeeding are you
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
know drinking that water as well but
 
05:36:20.708 --> 05:36:20.718 align:start position:0%
there's no uh there's no requirement
 
05:36:24.548 --> 05:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
necessary to say hey you're at 3.5 parts
 
05:36:27.030 --> 05:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
per million is that
 
05:36:29.310 --> 05:36:29.320 align:start position:0%
true there's notifications when it's
 
05:36:32.310 --> 05:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
over two parts per million that that
 
05:36:36.150 --> 05:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
there's risk for fosis um at that point
 
05:36:41.708 --> 05:36:41.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:44.830 --> 05:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
that's correct I I will say everyone is
 
05:36:46.750 --> 05:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
provided a summary of their water
 
05:36:47.990 --> 05:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
quality data through the consumer
 
05:36:49.510 --> 05:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
confidence report each year so they
 
05:36:51.310 --> 05:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
would know they have fluoride in there
 
05:36:53.350 --> 05:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
and could and could assess that or call
 
05:36:55.070 --> 05:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
us if they have specific questions that
 
05:36:58.628 --> 05:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
data is mandated to be provided to the
 
05:37:01.230 --> 05:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
public thank you any other questions for
 
05:37:01.240 --> 05:37:03.110 align:start position:0%
public thank you any other questions for
our

05:37:03.110 --> 05:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:37:07.070 --> 05:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
speakers Sergeant thank you Mr chair um
 
05:37:08.670 --> 05:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
do you think we should wait for the EPA
 
05:37:11.788 --> 05:37:11.798 align:start position:0%
to do its job and let us know the
 
05:37:13.990 --> 05:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
results before we do anything on the
 
05:37:16.470 --> 05:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
floride law in New
 
05:37:19.110 --> 05:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the department doesn't take
 
05:37:21.990 --> 05:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
a position on the bill today but we
 
05:37:23.910 --> 05:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
continue to look at the science and
 
05:37:26.110 --> 05:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
continue to support rules that have 7
 
05:37:28.030 --> 05:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
milligrams per liter and as I spoke
 
05:37:31.110 --> 05:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
earlier the court order directed APA to
 
05:37:34.470 --> 05:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
look at risk and in fact a few years ago
 
05:37:36.030 --> 05:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
when EPA asked the states what do you
 
05:37:38.150 --> 05:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
want us to look at we named FL magines
 
05:37:40.548 --> 05:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
and other compounds is something that
 
05:37:42.868 --> 05:37:42.878 align:start position:0%
warrants updated risk assessments so we
 
05:37:44.230 --> 05:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
think it's a really good idea to always
 
05:37:45.708 --> 05:37:45.718 align:start position:0%
be looking at the best science and
 
05:37:47.708 --> 05:37:47.718 align:start position:0%
updating recommendations we always would
 
05:37:47.718 --> 05:37:48.990 align:start position:0%
updating recommendations we always would
support

05:37:48.990 --> 05:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:37:52.030 --> 05:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
that any other
 
05:37:54.708 --> 05:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any thank you both
 
05:37:57.230 --> 05:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
for your presentation uh is there anyone
 
05:37:59.150 --> 05:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
else that wants to speak on this bill
 
05:38:01.070 --> 05:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
I'll ask one more time anyone else that
 
05:38:03.708 --> 05:38:03.718 align:start position:0%
wants to speak on this bill so I'll
 
05:38:06.750 --> 05:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on this bill and for
 
05:38:09.510 --> 05:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
those Pres in the
 
05:38:09.520 --> 05:38:11.070 align:start position:0%
those Pres in the
um

05:38:11.070 --> 05:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:15.990 --> 05:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:19.628 --> 05:38:19.638 align:start position:0%
let's 691 going to sub committe we
 
05:38:22.948 --> 05:38:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:25.548 --> 05:38:25.558 align:start position:0%
yet our presenter is in a hurry to get
 
05:38:28.470 --> 05:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
an answer so uh in order to preface
 
05:38:30.350 --> 05:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
where he wonders where are we going
 
05:38:32.470 --> 05:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a 20 minute break so
 
05:38:35.030 --> 05:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
you can go into caucus and we're going
 
05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
to come back at 4:10
 
05:38:42.548 --> 05:38:42.558 align:start position:0%
410 and I forgot to ask representative
 
05:38:44.750 --> 05:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
