uh
 
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:29.650 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee this house bill
 
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
320 is an important bill
 
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
it deals with free speech in the United
 
00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 align:start position:0%
States and
 
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
as we all know from recent news articles
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
allegations and in some cases most folks
 
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
have concluded
 
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
demonstrated situations in which social
 
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 align:start position:0%
media companies have censored various
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
messages that individuals are trying to
 
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
communicate on these
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
and for example on vaccines
 
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
and there's also evidence that the
 
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 align:start position:0%
federal government itself
 
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
including organizations such as the FBI
 
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
involve themselves in
 
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
um influencing the content that say
 
00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.029 align:start position:0%
um influencing the content that say
Twitter

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
Twitter
 
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
were allowed or by themselves censored
 
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
to put forward
 
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
we've all read about the hunter Biden
 
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan issue it's true
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
at the moment it seems the Republicans
 
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
are accusing the Democrats of doing
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
these things
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
but you and I both know
 
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
that what sauce for the goose is sauce
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
for the gander
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
and so when the Republicans are in
 
00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
control as they are of the house in
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
Congress now they will start using or
 
00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 align:start position:0%
thinking about using these same kinds of
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
tactics to achieve their political ends
 
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.650 align:start position:0%
tactics to achieve their political ends
and

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's an for me and I hope for you
 
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.029 align:start position:0%
it's an for me and I hope for you
unacceptable

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
unacceptable
 
00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
that the private sector or the
 
00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:18.950 align:start position:0%
that the private sector or the
government

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
would choose to use their mediums of
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
communication available to all and
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
censor them
 
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
that to me is the bit is it attacks the
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
basis of a democracy if we cannot have
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
free communication between us as
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
individuals through Twitter or Facebook
 
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
or whatever medium we're using including
 
00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
the newspapers but they're not part of
 
00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:41.930 align:start position:0%
the newspapers but they're not part of
this

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
then we all suffer because
 
00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
the basis of a democracy is debate and
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
conclusion and there can be no debate
 
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
there can be no discussion if someone
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
has his fingers on the scale
 
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's the situation now
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
where government is attempting to censor
 
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.469 align:start position:0%
where government is attempting to censor
and

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
these mediums of communication are
 
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
themselves attempting to censor the kind
 
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
of communication that goes on between
 
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.309 align:start position:0%
of communication that goes on between
individuals

00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:16.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.409 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:08:20.409 --> 00:08:20.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:23.220 align:start position:0%
who gets hurt from this
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire get hurt
 
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
because we can't have the kind of debate
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
we need to make reasonable decisions
 
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
Congress as you know is not acting
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
Congress is doing nothing about this
 
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
they're talking they're investigating
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
but they're doing nothing to solve this
 
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
on a national basis
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
what can we do in New Hampshire if
 
00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:47.449 align:start position:0%
what can we do in New Hampshire if
anything

00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:47.459 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:51.740 align:start position:0%
the answer is house bill 320.
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
let me explain a little bit is how as to
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
how this came about a number of months
 
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
ago in October I was reading the Wall
 
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
Street Journal and there was an article
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
in there by a Columbia law professor
 
00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
Philip hamburger
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
that raised this issue and proposed a
 
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
solution something I had never thought
 
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.290 align:start position:0%
solution something I had never thought
about

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
and that is he suggested that if these
 
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
organizations Twitter Facebook and so
 
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
forth were considered common carriers
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know like railroads or common
 
00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:20.459 align:start position:0%
carriers and utilities are common
 
00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:22.490 align:start position:0%
carriers and utilities are common
carriers

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
carriers
 
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
um they could be regulated in a way
 
00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:28.019 align:start position:0%
that was compatible with democracy and
 
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
not overly invasive
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
but would guarantee that
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint discrimination did not exist
 
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint is where somebody says
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
I'm pro-vaccine and somebody says I'm
 
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
I'm pro-vaccine and somebody says I'm
anti-vaccine

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
anti-vaccine
 
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
if you discriminate and say no the
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
pro-vaccine people cannot or the
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
anti-vaccine people cannot have a voice
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
on this platform we're going to censor
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
their Communications that's Viewpoint
 
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.610 align:start position:0%
their Communications that's Viewpoint
discrimination

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
inspired by this by the editor by the
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
op-ed I wrote to Professor hamburger and
 
00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:06.899 align:start position:0%
said do you have any legislative
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
solution for this and he said yes I do
 
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
state by state
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
regulation of these organizations as
 
00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:14.339 align:start position:0%
common carriers if the federal
 
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
government won't act New Hampshire can
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
act Vermont can act Maine can act
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill is
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
he sent me a
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
I guess you'd call it a piece of model
 
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.990 align:start position:0%
I guess you'd call it a piece of model
legislation

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
it was overly complex and legal so I
 
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
tried to pare it down to something at
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
least I could understand and hopefully
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
all of us can understand
 
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
and that's what you have before you
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
please understand that Viewpoint
 
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
discrimination is banned by this bill
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
but not content discrimination
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
the platform can say we're not going to
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
entertain any religious
 
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
or any political you name it
 
00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
material on our website
 
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
but if they allow religious or political
 
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
or whatever on their website then they
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
cannot discriminate
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
as between those people who take one
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
position on a religious issue and those
 
00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
people who take another position that's
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
what this bill does
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
it is constitutional there are no free
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
speech violations because of course the
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
entities Facebook or whatever it is can
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
voice whatever opinions they want
 
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.449 align:start position:0%
voice whatever opinions they want
themselves

00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:26.459 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
as long as they don't do it in a way
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
that in effect
 
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
um bans those people with a different
 
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
point of view from having their
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
perspective heard on Facebook or
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
whatever the the platform is
 
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.019 align:start position:0%
as you know there's a long history of of
 
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh common carrier regulation in the
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
United States starting with I think the
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
railroads I remember when I was in high
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
school or maybe it was College we were
 
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
discussing this and it seemed that the
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
railroads had this great idea that where
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
there were two competing lines they
 
00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
would charge the farmers who wanted to
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
get their goods to Market One price
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
that was lower than what they would
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
charge the farmer who was only served by
 
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
a single railroad line so they were
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
discriminating based on location
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
the farmers obviously a vast majority of
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
people in the 1880s were upset by this
 
00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:23.579 align:start position:0%
in Congress uh past legislation that in
 
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
effect prohibited this kind of activity
 
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
this discrimination based on location
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
for railroads
 
00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:32.579 align:start position:0%
as I said there's no First Amendment
 
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
issue here
 
00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
um we are this legislation has no impact
 
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
on the ability of the common carrier in
 
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
this case let's say Facebook from
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
advocating its own positions on its own
 
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.829 align:start position:0%
advocating its own positions on its own
network

00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
network
 
00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:47.150 align:start position:0%
network
so

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
to whom does this apply it applies to
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
social media companies such as Twitter
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
and Facebook that have at least 50
 
00:12:56.449 --> 00:12:56.459 align:start position:0%
million users in any calendar month so
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
this only applies to very large
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
platforms where people are using many
 
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
people are using them
 
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
it allows the companies to regulate the
 
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.069 align:start position:0%
it allows the companies to regulate the
content

00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
content
 
00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to cut to carry they
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
want videos or no videos whatever they
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
want that's up to them
 
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
it forbids discrimination
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
on a viewpoint on any topic
 
00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:21.889 align:start position:0%
on a viewpoint on any topic
and

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
as I said the company can voice its own
 
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.990 align:start position:0%
as I said the company can voice its own
opinions

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
it this bill also allows the companies
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
to ban unlawful content
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.810 align:start position:0%
for example
pornography

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
pornography
 
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
doxing violence support for terrorism
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
those can be banned they can
 
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
discriminate on the basis of content if
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
finally there is no conflict with
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
Federal section 230 which provides
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
protection for these social media
 
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:04.019 align:start position:0%
platforms against content discrimination
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
they cannot be sued if they for the
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
content that's put up on their websites
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
let's say it's vaccines or whatever it
 
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
might be they cannot be sued for
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
anything that anybody says about that
 
00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
but section 230 has nothing to do with
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint discrimination and that's
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
where the state of New Hampshire can
 
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.990 align:start position:0%
where the state of New Hampshire can
regulate

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.210 align:start position:0%
regulate
so

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
I would ask the committee to pass this
 
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
bill to protect the ability of everyone
 
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to express his or her
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
opinion on social media and not be
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
subject to censorship
 
00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:42.829 align:start position:0%
subject to censorship
and

00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
to prevent the government
 
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
from influencing our ability to hear
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
other views
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
or to voice our own
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
as I said this is very important
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
legislation that promotes free speech
 
00:14:58.129 --> 00:14:58.139 align:start position:0%
and I hope the committee will vote it
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
out as ought to pass with whatever
 
00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:02.459 align:start position:0%
amendments are necessary to clarify
 
00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:05.339 align:start position:0%
things thank you Mr chairman I'd be
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
willing to answer any questions if there
 
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
are any questions from members of the
 
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative Wallace
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question have
 
00:15:14.689 --> 00:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
any other states uh enacted this
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
legislation no as usual New Hampshire is
 
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
going to be first thank you
 
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative yeah
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you sir for
 
00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:26.459 align:start position:0%
uh bringing this bill uh a couple of
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
questions you said that this would only
 
00:15:32.449 --> 00:15:32.459 align:start position:0%
apply to social media platforms of 50
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
million users in a calendar month
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
correct what is to prevent them because
 
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
that seems like an arbitrary number
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
although I'm sure they well exceed that
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
but we know that Twitter for example and
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
other social media have used Bots to
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
inflate what the appears to be the
 
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
number of users when they are in fact
 
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
phony accounts so what is to prevent
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
them from suppressing the user numbers
 
00:15:59.810 --> 00:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to fly under the
 
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
radar of this and avoid any
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
accountability to this
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
um I suppose the direct answer is
 
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
nothing but from a from a company point
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
of view that would be very undesirable
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of advertising and other
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
Revenue I doubt very much if the company
 
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
would care so much about this that they
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
would be willing to sacrifice millions
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
or tens of millions of dollars in
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue to avoid this kind of Regulation
 
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
follow-up sir yes thank you and secondly
 
00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:29.150 align:start position:0%
follow-up sir yes thank you and secondly
uh

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:32.579 align:start position:0%
you said that this would not prevent
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
them from censoring such as uh child
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
pornography and terrorism and stuff like
 
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
that and while that sounds good and we
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
want we certainly would want that the
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
problem comes into who defines what is
 
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
Terrorism when a parent standing up at a
 
00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:50.579 align:start position:0%
school board meeting is now called a
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
domestic terrorist
 
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
Point well taken sir my understanding is
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
the law with respect to support for
 
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
terrorism is a federal law
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
and I'm not an expert on that and it may
 
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:06.299 align:start position:0%
be that that federal law is flawed but
 
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:08.339 align:start position:0%
to the extent it's flawed we all suffer
 
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
from that generally and in this
 
00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:12.419 align:start position:0%
legislation this legislation does not
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
try to correct that issue to the extent
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness yes
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
good morning I wanted to ask you a
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman numeral three says some
 
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:36.020 align:start position:0%
interactive computer services
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on and is the
 
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
definition of some related to the size
 
00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
is that how you're defining some yes
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan do you have a
 
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.450 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan do you have a
question

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
um well yes uh
 
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
you talking about uh we're asking for
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
about support for terrorism but we're
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
versus these Services draw the line when
 
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
it's you know not just a parent at a
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
school board meeting but you know a
 
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
National Republic official or another
 
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
individual actually has
 
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
um you know power to encourage others to
 
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
break the lawn is using the platform to
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
do so so like would that be appropriate
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
would that be appropriate to uh would it
 
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
still be appropriate for them to you
 
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
know block such an individual
 
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
if they believe they're engaging in
 
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
illegal activity and
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not not naming any individual in
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
particular because the one I'm thinking
 
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
of is someone we're not supposed to talk
 
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
about but anyway yes so this would not
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
prevent him from uh this would not
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
prevent him from blocking the use of
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
their platform to encourage you know
 
00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
illegal activity though no I don't
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
believe it would
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think this bill in any way
 
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
changes or deals with that problem and
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
it is a problem
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
but I don't think this bill deals with
 
00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:54.539 align:start position:0%
it if the problem exists it continues to
 
00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
exist with this bill and it will
 
00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
continue to exist if this bill is not
 
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:00.419 align:start position:0%
passed this bill does not address that
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
issue and It suffers as does all
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
legislation from that the fact that that
 
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and Mr chairman uh
 
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.090 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and Mr chairman uh
America

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
America
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
and looking at this bill
 
00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:27.409 align:start position:0%
and looking at this bill
um

00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:27.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
I come I understand that we would be
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
breaking new grounds and we usually have
 
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
no problem with that I'm just curious
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
mechanism are we expecting that to fall
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
completely on the courts when a user
 
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
brings a complaint or is there another
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
way that the user could demonstrate a
 
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
complaint and then what happens
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh the provision of this bill is
 
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
enforced by the provisions of this bill
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
are enforced by the individual who
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
suffered an injury as a result of this
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
and yes you're right the individual
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
under this bill would go to court and
 
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
sue the social media platform for the
 
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.650 align:start position:0%
sue the social media platform for the
violation

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
violation
 
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.409 align:start position:0%
violation
um

00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:21.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
as you can see from the fiscal note
 
00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
there is an
 
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
indeterminate amount of a number of
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
additional court cases as a result of
 
00:20:31.679 --> 00:20:33.110 align:start position:0%
additional court cases as a result of
this

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.669 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
therefore the fiscal notes does not
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
specify a particular number but yes
 
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
there would be an additional burden on
 
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
representative Andrus did you have a
 
00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:47.450 align:start position:0%
representative Andrus did you have a
question

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question why is this
 
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
bill limited to
 
00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
uses of 50 million a month or more why
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
not smaller
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
uses included
 
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
that's a good question when I originally
 
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh drafted a version of this I dropped
 
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
the 50 million down to 1 million
 
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
and as you'll see from
 
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
Professor hamburger's letter which each
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
of you has a copy of as well as the
 
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:20.660 align:start position:0%
original opinion piece that I mentioned
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
it has to do with the nature of what a
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
common carrier is
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
there are three points that he makes
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
about common carriers and one of them
 
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
has to do with size and the number of
 
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.330 align:start position:0%
has to do with size and the number of
people

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
that are affected by
 
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
the activity and when I suggested a
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
million he immediately said that number
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
is too low that would give opponents a
 
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
really good case to say that this isn't
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
that these platforms are not common
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
carriers they don't affect enough people
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
and so it was his number that I restored
 
00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire version because I
 
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:00.020 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that
 
00:22:03.409 --> 00:22:03.419 align:start position:0%
these activities these social media
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
platforms are in fact considered common
 
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.470 align:start position:0%
platforms are in fact considered common
carriers

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
carriers
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
and they have to serve a large number of
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
other question yes uh representative
 
00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.930 align:start position:0%
other question yes uh representative
Turner

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
Turner
 
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank thanks for uh answering uh
 
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.070 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank thanks for uh answering uh
questions

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
um I guess my concern really is around
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
the concept of common carrier at a state
 
00:22:26.039 --> 00:22:27.470 align:start position:0%
the concept of common carrier at a state
level

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
um I don't know and maybe this is a
 
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
multi-part question is it are there
 
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
other examples of common carriers that
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
are established at the state level and
 
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
sort of within New Hampshire
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
do we have any statutes that discuss
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
what a common carrier is and my
 
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
understanding is most of them at the
 
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
federal level are assigned under an
 
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.390 align:start position:0%
federal level are assigned under an
oversight

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
um board or something that they're
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
responsible to so could you say a little
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
bit more about what a common carrier at
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
the state level is and how it would how
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
it would operate
 
00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:02.930 align:start position:0%
it would operate
um

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
I think I'm On Solid Ground on this but
 
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
I would stand corrected
 
00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:08.900 align:start position:0%
if if I'm not
 
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
I believe our Public Utility Commission
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
regulates common carriers that is to say
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
telephone companies water companies and
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
other utilities which
 
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.090 align:start position:0%
other utilities which
um

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
basically um
 
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299 align:start position:0%
serve a large number of people have some
 
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
sort of Monopoly type power or
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
significant Market influence and that
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire has
 
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
determined by Statute that these
 
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
companies are common carriers and need
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
to be regulated now in the case of these
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
kinds of utilities there's a very
 
00:23:42.669 --> 00:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
stringent regulatory framework with a um
 
00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
regulatory agency in the case of this
 
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
bill the idea is to tread very lightly
 
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
and not regulate them except for one
 
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
thing Viewpoint discrimination
 
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up so so are you
 
00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
suggesting that this would fall under
 
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
the puc no no not at all it would unless
 
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
you change the bill to say that this
 
00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:06.059 align:start position:0%
these organizations would be regulated
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting that I don't think
 
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
it's necessary I think the enforcement
 
00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
regulation the enforcement mechanism of
 
00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:15.299 align:start position:0%
an individual is adversely affected is
 
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
the right way to go we don't need a
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy to take care of this
 
00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
relatively small but very significant
 
00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:26.930 align:start position:0%
relatively small but very significant
issue

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness uh yes
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp
 
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
my question uh
 
00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
the issue I have with this is uh you're
 
00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:40.490 align:start position:0%
the issue I have with this is uh you're
treating

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
treating
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
social media
 
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
as a product rather than a service
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
these the people that
 
00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:54.419 align:start position:0%
use the
 
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
social media are just that they're not
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
customers they're they're users so uh
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh it being a free service how can they
 
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
that's a very basic question and a very
 
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
important question
 
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.049 align:start position:0%
important question
um

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
first as I understand it the while it
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
may be a free service you have to
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
register you have to sign up for
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:30.539 align:start position:0%
and once you do that
 
00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:31.370 align:start position:0%
and once you do that
um

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:33.529 --> 00:25:33.539 align:start position:0%
there's no product involved except what
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
you create the message or the pictures
 
00:25:39.409 --> 00:25:39.419 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is it's a service
 
00:25:39.419 --> 00:25:40.669 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is it's a service
and

00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
the service is
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
allows you to communicate
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
this bill simply says that communication
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
has to be yours yours only and cannot be
 
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.450 align:start position:0%
has to be yours yours only and cannot be
censored

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's responsive but
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you could clarify that's a good
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
answer I'll accept it thank you
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
we have other questions
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Oregon oh thank you
 
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
um I mean I could defer to any of the
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
members who have already asked one um so
 
00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:12.419 align:start position:0%
these Facebook services like Facebook
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
and Twitter they're uh for profit
 
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
companies their business model is
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
basically that they mix in well
 
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
primarily is that they
 
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
mix in some some ads in with the feed of
 
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
messages from other people and the way
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
they uh and they also like want to want
 
00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:30.299 align:start position:0%
you to log on as often as possible and
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
spend as much time reading it so that
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
means first of all they have to have a
 
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
obviously the advertisers don't
 
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to be associated with
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
you know extraordinarily objectionable
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
content but more to the point the
 
00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:44.039 align:start position:0%
if you're a user you might like to see
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
some things you disagree with but you
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
know nobody wants to see anything that's
 
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
repellent you don't want to see too much
 
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
of repellent you know like I don't want
 
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
to log on to Facebook and Twitter and
 
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
see only like a million posts by Nazis
 
00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299 align:start position:0%
for example so how do how do you balance
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
out the business model with the
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
interests of uh interests of free speech
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
and of course also freedom of the press
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
this also includes the authority not to
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
use your press to print things you don't
 
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
want to print some of the so is there
 
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
like a decision so does you think this
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
um infringes on does you think this
 
00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:18.419 align:start position:0%
still respects their business models so
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
they can make a profit while also uh
 
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
maybe engaging in different practices
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
than they have been
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon this does not
 
00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:30.059 align:start position:0%
affect their business model
 
00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:31.370 align:start position:0%
affect their business model
um

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
all they need to do is continue business
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
as usual and just make sure that they
 
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
don't uh
 
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
prevent your particular message from
 
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
being heard and my particular message
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
from being heard they continue to
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
advertise and put these ads in as you've
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
suggested this has no impact on that
 
00:27:51.179 --> 00:27:52.190 align:start position:0%
suggested this has no impact on that
whatsoever

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:00.539 align:start position:0%
first where we live in the state of New
 
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but these other platforms
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
are probably out of other states I know
 
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
Facebook for example I believe is out of
 
00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:09.299 align:start position:0%
California and so
 
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
I guess two-part question how can this
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
be enforced and then secondly
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
is there any bit of apprehension that
 
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
perhaps these companies will just say as
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
part of their signing up that hey if
 
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
you're from the state of New Hampshire
 
00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:24.179 align:start position:0%
you're ineligible because we'd be the
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
only state to be implementing something
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
like this so perhaps they just wouldn't
 
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
I can see the headlines thank you for
 
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
the question I can see the headlines
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
Twitter bans New Hampshire
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
if if you're trying to make money and
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
you have a business model that's not the
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
headline you want to see so while I
 
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that they could do
 
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.390 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that they could do
that

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
um I doubt very much that they would
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
among other things as soon as that
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
happens should it happen other states
 
00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
would immediately say oh boy we've got
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
to join New Hampshire this is absolutely
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
unacceptable and that in fact if they
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
did something like that Congress might
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
even act
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not concerned I don't think I
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that's an issue I'm sorry I
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
forgot the rest of your question
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
how it could be enforced you know only
 
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire where
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
these companies are doing their business
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
out of other companies and it's not a
 
00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
platform that we're paying for so how
 
00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
could how could it be enforced where
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
they're in another state than us
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
um when there were customers in New
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there are for all of these
 
00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:39.169 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there are for all of these
platforms

00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
platforms
 
00:29:39.179 --> 00:29:39.830 align:start position:0%
platforms
um

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
the companies are in effect doing
 
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire they have
 
00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:45.059 align:start position:0%
customers here they may not have a
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
physical presence here as you point out
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
their servers may be elsewhere and our
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
courts will take jurisdiction of that
 
00:29:54.889 --> 00:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
to protect New Hampshire customers from
 
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
this kind of activity illegal
 
00:29:59.330 --> 00:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
discrimination should the bill pass
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
yes sure
 
00:30:03.529 --> 00:30:03.539 align:start position:0%
I understand that for the business
 
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
people the people that are actually
 
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
paying for for the people that are using
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
it as a free platform are they
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
technically a customer even though
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
they're not paying anything
 
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the right word is
 
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
customer but there's certainly a user
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
and they have a physical presence in New
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and some sort of a legal
 
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
relationship with the company because
 
00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:24.539 align:start position:0%
normally when you signed up you have to
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
agree for this this huge list of things
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
that nobody reads but we all say yes we
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative Perez
 
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:45.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
and if you don't know what that is they
 
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
block you for 30 days so that's a
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
wonderful term I I hadn't heard it
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
before but I like it um I borrowed that
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
from someone else so it's not original
 
00:30:59.630 --> 00:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
um this has been going on for a long
 
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
long time since the beginning of this I
 
00:31:05.289 --> 00:31:05.299 align:start position:0%
just wondered if there was something
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
in particular that prompted
 
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
this bill for now
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
the thing that prompted me for now is
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
the article that appeared in the uh Wall
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
Street Journal that's the immediate
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
impetus but for me personally over the
 
00:31:24.289 --> 00:31:24.299 align:start position:0%
years I've I've read about all of these
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
kinds of activities censoring activities
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
that the companies are doing or
 
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
allegations and I'm saying to myself
 
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
this is not right we need to have a
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
robust debate about these issues
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
and so I sat and stewed then I saw this
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
opinion piece with a possible solution I
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
jumped on it and I'm bringing it forward
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
to the legislature I think there's a
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
real problem I think this is a viable
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
solution and I think this is so in New
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tradition that I would I would
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
hope the legislature would take it up
 
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
and pass it
 
00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair thanks for taking
 
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
my question couldn't the harvesting of
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
personal information by the social media
 
00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
platforms be considered a payment as the
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.630 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
other questions uh representative tur
 
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.850 align:start position:0%
other questions uh representative tur
ret

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
ret
 
00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to ask about this
 
00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:21.539 align:start position:0%
section and and perhaps I'm not
 
00:32:24.769 --> 00:32:24.779 align:start position:0%
understanding at the 359 u3 where it
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
says waiver prohibited and it basically
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like even if you wave your rights
 
00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:33.539 align:start position:0%
through I agree kind of Click because
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's how I'm not interpreting it
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't sure what that
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
does in terms of of
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
um giving up sort of the contractual
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
relationship between an organization and
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
a user and and sort of down below and I
 
00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
don't know if this section just
 
00:32:54.049 --> 00:32:54.059 align:start position:0%
applies to the waiver or applies to the
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
entire law where it says this chapter
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
applies to a user Who currently resides
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
in the state does business in the state
 
00:33:02.649 --> 00:33:02.659 align:start position:0%
or shares or receives
 
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
expression in the state the way the way
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
I would read that would be essentially
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
everyone in the United States or maybe
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
Beyond you know could fall into one of
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
those three categories and so if it
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
applied to
 
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
um those if it applied broadly and not
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
just the waiver
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
um would it would it be the case that
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
someone from California because they
 
00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
sent me a Facebook message once would
 
00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:34.019 align:start position:0%
would be someone who expressed in the
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
state and we could essentially become
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
the grounds for everyone who has a
 
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
grievance against Facebook
 
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
very good questions thank you for them
 
00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:46.019 align:start position:0%
the waiver is the language is put in for
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
a very simple reason
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
as I said before the terms of service
 
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
are something nobody reads and everybody
 
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
has to sign and we don't read it because
 
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
we don't have the time to read it and if
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
we read it we couldn't understand it
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
anyway I've tried to read those I'm
 
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
reasonably literate I find it extremely
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that companies would
 
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
circumvent this law is to put a
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
condition in the terms of of service
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
that says the user waives his right to
 
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419 align:start position:0%
bring lost a lawsuit under house bill
 
00:34:21.419 --> 00:34:23.030 align:start position:0%
bring lost a lawsuit under house bill
320.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
320.
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
obviously that would be very easy for
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
them to do and would totally uh
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
undermine this legislation and so
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
there's a provision that says you can't
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
a pretty obvious response that a company
 
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
might have and therefore a pretty
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
obvious response that the legislature
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
ought to have
 
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.109 align:start position:0%
ought to have
um

00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is concerned I think you have to
 
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
have some Nexus some connection with New
 
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to bring a suit in our courts
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
I don't see the California person having
 
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
that right but I do see the New
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire person having that right
 
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
somebody who is either physically here
 
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
or is is expressing his views in this
 
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
state you could make the argument that
 
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
the California person is expressing his
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
views in this state
 
00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.410 align:start position:0%
views in this state
um

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.270 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
if that's a concern
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
it can be addressed in an amendment
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.609 --> 00:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
Free Speech was protected as widely as
 
00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
possible hence that language
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Kirk great
 
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk appreciate your
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%

know I know we have a number of other
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
people that wants to testify in this and
 
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that we have a very full
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh docket today so I'm going to ask if
 
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
you would please as you come to testify
 
00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
to do your very best to limit your
 
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
testimony to three minutes uh I'm not
 
00:35:59.569 --> 00:35:59.579 align:start position:0%
going to cut somebody off in the middle
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
of an answer or something like that but
 
00:36:03.849 --> 00:36:03.859 align:start position:0%
just be sensitive to the issue of time
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
so next I'm going to call on
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh Chris Marchesi
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
um uh Mr Martin if you come up please
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%

yes and I would say if you uh if if
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
um we all have the ability to read and
 
00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
we will read it so you don't need to uh
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
um you don't need to uh go into detail
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
about what you've said in your written
 
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee my
 
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
name is Chris Marchese and I'm here
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of netchoice a trade
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
Association based in Washington DC our
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
members include The Usual Suspects like
 
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
Google meta
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
Etc as well as some of the uh platforms
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
that we use every day but don't
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily think of as social media
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
like Pinterest eBay
 
00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
um and Etsy so I'm here today to testify
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
against Bill 320 and the reason why is
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
because it is unconstitutional in fact
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
the state of Texas tried this exact same
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
bill and it is currently on appeal to
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court in fact tomorrow
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
the court is expected to rule in our
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
cert petition both the state of Texas
 
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
and US as the plaintiffs have agreed
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court needs to weigh in
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
sooner than later and clarify some of
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
these legal issues and my testimony the
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
written testimony goes into detail about
 
00:37:44.089 --> 00:37:44.099 align:start position:0%
why this is an unconstitutional bill but
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
here I'm just going to focus on the
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
highest level concern which is that if
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
you want to protect the First Amendment
 
00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:53.099 align:start position:0%
you do so by preventing violations of
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment not by actually
 
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
violating it yourself and that is
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
exactly what this bill would do because
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
it forces private companies remember
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
they are private even if they are large
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
they are still private companies and the
 
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
idea of 4 forcing them to carry somebody
 
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
else's speech it should be Insidious to
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
all of us the First Amendment doesn't
 
00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:17.339 align:start position:0%
just protect the right to speak it also
 
00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
protects the right to remain silent and
 
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
it certainly protects the right not to
 
00:38:23.569 --> 00:38:23.579 align:start position:0%
have to carry somebody else's message
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
even in the marketplace of ideas we
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
can't have the government coming in and
 
00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
saying you know what we think that all
 
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
viewpoints should be heard or else no
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
viewpoints will be heard and that is
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what we heard from the sponsors
 
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
of this bill you can ban content
 
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
categories but you can't ban viewpoints
 
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
that's going to leave us with an
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
internet with basically no content
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day there is a
 
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
vile viewpoint on just about every
 
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
everything imaginable somewhere in this
 
00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
country there is someone with a very
 
00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
nasty view that wants to share it on the
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
internet and to be honest with you as
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
our lawsuits have discovered there is
 
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
very scary vile content on the internet
 
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:07.940 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:39:10.329 --> 00:39:10.339 align:start position:0%
astounding what people can come up with
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
and yet this bill would say if you want
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
to talk about the Holocaust then you
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
also have to allow Holocaust denial
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
if you want to have an educational
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
seminar about you know Hitler you must
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
also allow pro-hitler content
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
so this is a a very practical concern
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
it's either we're going to have no
 
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
content and therefore be safe from vile
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
content that parents don't want their
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
kids to see and quite frankly I don't
 
00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:38.099 align:start position:0%
think anyone in this room wants to see
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
or we're going to allow all viewpoints
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
including the viewpoints from people who
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps are not actually on the internet
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
to engage in meaningful discussion
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
so that's point one the second point is
 
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
that this bill will have unintended
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
consequences even if somehow it were
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
rendered constitutional you know earlier
 
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned that data is very
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
important to tech companies that is true
 
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
but this bill would actually require the
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
collection of even more data think about
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
it in order to comply with this log tech
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
companies every single website covered
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
by it would need to know where content
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
is coming from is this user in the state
 
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire or are they in
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
California are they in California trying
 
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
to reach people in New Hampshire
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
that is going to require even more data
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
collection and that would be sanctioned
 
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
under law it would be required by law
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
and then the third thing to say here is
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
you know net choice we are a
 
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
right-of-center trade Association and we
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
fully agree that it is inappropriate if
 
00:40:40.609 --> 00:40:40.619 align:start position:0%
not outright unconstitutional for the
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
federal government to be weighing in on
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
content decisions
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
you know it is one thing for the federal
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
government to work with platforms to
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
remove child pornography and content
 
00:40:52.609 --> 00:40:52.619 align:start position:0%
harmful to Children it is quite a
 
00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
different thing for the federal
 
00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
government to be weighing in on vaccine
 
00:40:55.859 --> 00:40:57.130 align:start position:0%
government to be weighing in on vaccine
information

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:57.140 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
or misinformation whatever you want to
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
call it that is inappropriate and that
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
is why we support a federal Bill
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
currently pending in Congress that is
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
due for a vote I think either next week
 
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
or the week after that would prohibit
 
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
every Federal bureaucrat from weighing
 
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
in on content decisions it is sponsored
 
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
by representative Jim Jordan Kevin Comer
 
00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
and Kathy McMorris Rogers and that bill
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
would prohibit exactly what we heard
 
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
earlier about the Twitter files and you
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
know President Biden's disinformation
 
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.650 align:start position:0%
know President Biden's disinformation
board

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:34.140 align:start position:0%
so it is simply not true that this bill
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't been tried it's been tried in
 
00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
Texas and it is currently pending before
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
The Supreme Court it's a similar version
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
was also tried in Florida and the 11th
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
circuit unanimously Struck it down as
 
00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.130 align:start position:0%
circuit unanimously Struck it down as
unconstitutional

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
so to support free speech that also
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
means that we need to
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
accept the fact that some private
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
businesses will do things with their
 
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
free speech that we don't like it
 
00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we don't have recourse
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
it just means that our recourse is in
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
the court of public opinion rather than
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom
 
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman questions for this
 
00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:16.790 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman questions for this
Witness

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.329 align:start position:0%
 
es

00:42:19.329 --> 00:42:19.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
there are more coming around oh they're
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
more coming around bro I'm sorry no no
 
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
problem apologies I'm not very good
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
accounting right
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
do we you know do you um I wonder if
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you so all right we'll
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
get that all right uh other questions
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
right I just have one question
 
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
um the fifth circuit that you said the
 
00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
case is up to the Supreme Court the
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
fifth circuit rule in your client's
 
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
favor or against you against us two to
 
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
one so so it's uh so the the status of
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
the of the law so to speak to the extent
 
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
it's been decided is you won one in the
 
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
11th circuit and you lost one in the
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
fifth and you're hoping the Supreme
 
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
Court is gonna go your way on the fifth
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
circuit case well Mr chairman out of
 
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
every federal court to review our cases
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
every single one has been in agreement
 
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
that these laws are unconstitutional
 
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
except for the fifth circuit and in that
 
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
instance it was a two to one decision so
 
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
two judges thought that the K that the
 
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
Texas law was constitutional although
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
one said perhaps it's too soon to tell
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
and we need more hearing or uh more
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
litigation about it and you know I think
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
given the weight of the Precedence given
 
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
what has already been said in the 11th
 
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
circuit we are confident that the
 
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court will agree with us and
 
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
it's also worth noting that when the
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
fifth circuit ruled against us we went
 
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court asking for an
 
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
emergency injunction and the court
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
granted us that injunction so that is
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
kind of a preview that at least a
 
00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
majority of the Supreme Court thinks
 
00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
that this law is unconstitutional
 
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
other questions for this yes
 
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative match
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
good morning do your members agree that
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
you are common carriers
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
no we are adamant that we are not common
 
00:44:09.599 --> 00:44:10.849 align:start position:0%
no we are adamant that we are not common
carriers

00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
carriers
 
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.870 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
um and

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
um I guess is it accurate what I said
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
earlier that the business model of uh
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
Facebook and Twitter and these other
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
things just basically provide people
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
with content which they actually want to
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
see which may include some content that
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
they don't agree with but people don't
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
want to see anything that's like totally
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
repugnant they don't want to see a feed
 
00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
full of things that they totally hate
 
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
and don't want to look at are totally
 
00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
repugnant to them and also advertisers
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
or probably want to be somewhat
 
00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
selective about what sort of content is
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
appearing alongside their ads too is
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
that is that an accurate summary of your
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
uh of your business model of your
 
00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
clients it absolutely is and just to
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
give one very brief example when hb20
 
00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
was in effect in Texas and interestingly
 
00:44:59.770 --> 00:44:59.780 align:start position:0%
enough there sounds even the same hb20
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh when it was in effect in Texas we had
 
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
the massacre in Buffalo occur and as you
 
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
may recall the murderer posted a vile
 
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
Manifesto on the internet explaining why
 
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
he did what he did and technically under
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
hb20 our members were not legally
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to remove that content
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
so even though it is a vile violent
 
00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:26.339 align:start position:0%
disgusting Viewpoint it is
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected speech and
 
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
the only reason why our members were
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
able to remove it is because we were
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
able to have the law enjoined meaning
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
not enforced but otherwise the manifesto
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
as well as the video of innocent
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
Americans being gunned down would have
 
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
been left up on the internet at least in
 
00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:44.579 align:start position:0%
the state of Texas
 
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
other questions yeah
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
one one specific practice I'm curious
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
which like well Twitter in particular is
 
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
often being accused of Shadow banding
 
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
conservatives and I've noticed even with
 
00:45:58.609 --> 00:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
things that I tweet that sometimes I
 
00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
tweet him and only a few people see them
 
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
is that is anything Sinister going on or
 
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
is that because their algorithm thinks
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
that there aren't that many people who
 
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
want to listen to what I'm saying so
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
well I'm assuming the algorithm has it
 
00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:14.220 align:start position:0%
wrong if you're not getting a lot of
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
I will say that I am not too uh familiar
 
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
with how Twitter does
 
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh content promotion and how it decides
 
00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
in what order tweets will be shown but I
 
00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:32.339 align:start position:0%
know that Elon Musk would not be able to
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
do what he's doing at Twitter today if
 
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
this were law and that's because Elon
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
Musk has been you know operating in real
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
time to experiment with new things at
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
Twitter it's actually kind of
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
interesting to see you know the CEO of a
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
social media company engaging with the
 
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
public in real time on hey what do you
 
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
guys want to see with this platform that
 
00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
you're using and he goes back and forth
 
00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
with users under this bill some of those
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
changes would not be allowed thank you
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
very much any other questions all right
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
um next we have uh Christopher
 
00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Lynn members of the
 
00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
committee I am delighted to be here for
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh my first New Hampshire testimony of
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
um I will be uh very brief as I know we
 
00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
are running up on time I did uh submit
 
00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:38.579 align:start position:0%
written testimony electronically
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
um I do not have uh copies for the for
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
the members here but uh I uh hope that
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
you will get it
 
00:47:45.599 --> 00:47:46.490 align:start position:0%
you will get it
um

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
so uh my name is Chris gilray and I
 
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:50.579 align:start position:0%
represent TechNet in the Northeast we
 
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
are a trade Association comprised of
 
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
over a hundred companies uh in the
 
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
Innovation space uh including uh
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
platforms that would be covered under
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
this legislation I'm here in opposition
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
to HB 320
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
um because it would completely undermine
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
content moderation practices that keep
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
your constituents safe online
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh social media companies review
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of pieces of data
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
daily to filter and remove content that
 
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
violates Community standards things that
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
are legal and constitutional uh but
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
represent things that we don't want to
 
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:29.300 align:start position:0%
see bullying harassment hate speech
 
00:48:32.569 --> 00:48:32.579 align:start position:0%
scams spam and other objectionable
 
00:48:32.579 --> 00:48:33.770 align:start position:0%
scams spam and other objectionable
content

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
content
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
HP 320 would create a perverse incentive
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
for companies to stop removing
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
objectionable content in order to avoid
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
the risk of lawsuits created by this
 
00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.089 align:start position:0%
the risk of lawsuits created by this
legislation

00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:44.099 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
the bill exclusively allows companies to
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
remove content that violates federal law
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
as we've heard there is a massive
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
Universe of things that we find
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
repugnant that are nonetheless legal
 
00:48:58.550 --> 00:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
under federal law and would be required
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
to be hosted on these platforms
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
it would present uh a harmful online
 
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
experience and create real world dangers
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
for granite Staters uh as I read it the
 
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
bill would also circumvent parental
 
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
controls uh as the bill prohibits
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
content from being received by all users
 
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
puts New Hampshire in the position of
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
dictating to how a private Enterprise
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
can run its business and enforces it
 
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
with the blunt force of a private right
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
of action
 
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
uh it would create uh as uh
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative Smith identified a burden
 
00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire's courts uh if it were
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
not in fact enjoined uh by uh a previous
 
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
uh lawsuit but uh the courts would be
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
flooded with these kinds of lawsuits and
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
it does not serve to protect the free
 
00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:52.619 align:start position:0%
exchange of ideas but instead would fill
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
these pages with so much filth as to
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
render the platform's functionally
 
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
useless I am here uh to uh in the real
 
00:50:04.609 --> 00:50:04.619 align:start position:0%
physical Public Square uh to address my
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
elected officials and ask them not to
 
00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579 align:start position:0%
advance uh this legislation all right
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%

00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
trade Association
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
um we're a center left leaning Tech
 
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
trade Association
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
um we represent like uh the other two
 
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
Chris's you know the Googles the
 
00:51:11.329 --> 00:51:11.339 align:start position:0%
Facebooks of the world
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here to urge your command to
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
um the other two Chris's have made a lot
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the points that I would like to make
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I want to be conscious of time so
 
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
keep things very short
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
um but I'd like to make uh two at least
 
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
two quick points
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
um first consumers and constituents uh I
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
don't think actually want this type of
 
00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
Bill out there we've done a set of
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
polling my organization a national poll
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
and we found that 67 percent of Voters
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
said that social media companies and
 
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
online platforms should be able to block
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
violent and offensive content in fact a
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
majority of social media companies uh a
 
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
majority of Voters want social media
 
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
companies to actually do more content
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
moderation and this includes pluralities
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
of Democrats Republicans and
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
independents so across uh the entire
 
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
political Spectrum kind of uh the
 
00:52:08.089 --> 00:52:08.099 align:start position:0%
majority of constituents and voters
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
think that there needs to be more
 
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
content moderation uh not less
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
um the second point I want to make is a
 
00:52:17.329 --> 00:52:17.339 align:start position:0%
point that uh the other two Chris's have
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
already made in that this will result in
 
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.750 align:start position:0%
already made in that this will result in
more

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
um obscene and unsavory content on the
 
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
internet and I think it will also make
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
Spam a major problem on the internet and
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
Thai companies for hands against toxic
 
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
and incendiary content third and finally
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
this law will almost certainly face and
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps lose a court challenge under the
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
First Amendment
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
um and no no one wants the internet to
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
become you know a cesspool of offensive
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
content and consumers have consistently
 
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
told us through the polling that we've
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
done that they want more content
 
00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
moderation not less so we urge you to
 
00:53:00.609 --> 00:53:00.619 align:start position:0%
listen to the concerns raised by voters
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
fellow lawmakers in the Constitution and
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
reject this Bill thank you very much
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I will submit um
 
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
some written comments and documentation
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
so I'll make this um even briefer uh
 
00:53:29.569 --> 00:53:29.579 align:start position:0%
this is not unconstitutional the fifth
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
circuit has also an essentially issue to
 
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
stay pending appeal
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
um the first amendment in free speech is
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
known as the marketplace of ideas this
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
is applied specificity specifically to
 
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
Common carriers having 50 million people
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
I did uh some recent research looked
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
like Facebook has 240 million people in
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
the U.S representing about 70 percent of
 
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
the population the Texas law similarly
 
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
had 50 million people in regards to the
 
00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%
common carrier question uh the Texas
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
Bill specifically to find common carrier
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
as a social media platform uh
 
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
with the largest number users or common
 
00:54:06.049 --> 00:54:06.059 align:start position:0%
carriers by virtue of their market
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
dominance I would suggest that 70 is
 
00:54:09.849 --> 00:54:09.859 align:start position:0%
effectively a market dominance
 
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
commercial speech is a type of speech
 
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
it's a type of speech that is giving one
 
00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
of the lowest protections
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
um amongst various types of speeches on
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
the other tan political speech is given
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
typically the most protection of any
 
00:54:26.809 --> 00:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
speech in regards to political speech
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
this is Viewpoint discrimination courts
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
have pretty much possibly unanimously or
 
00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:34.940 align:start position:0%
if not near unanimally near unanimously
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
prohibited Viewpoint discrimination
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
every um there's been a lot of comments
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
talking about violent offensive speech
 
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
similar this bill specifically allows
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
Facebook and every social media
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
organization to still prohibit all that
 
00:54:50.569 --> 00:54:50.579 align:start position:0%
content if you look at page three of the
 
00:54:50.579 --> 00:54:52.190 align:start position:0%
content if you look at page three of the
bill

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:54:56.809 --> 00:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
um chapter well it's uh lines 27 through
 
00:54:56.819 --> 00:54:58.069 align:start position:0%
um chapter well it's uh lines 27 through
30.

00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
30.
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
um this specifically allows them to
 
00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
block unlawful expression that harasses
 
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
people incites violence obscene Lew
 
00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
lascivious filthiest excessively
 
00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
violently and harassing and other
 
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:11.579 align:start position:0%
Behavior so things that people don't
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
want and that poll that they mentioned
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
would still be prohibited under this
 
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
bill I'll add that I have also been in
 
00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
Facebook jail for numerous times uh
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
Facebook Shadow bans me
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
um and what that means is they
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
essentially limit my contacts to certain
 
00:55:24.359 --> 00:55:26.329 align:start position:0%
essentially limit my contacts to certain
people

00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:55:26.339 --> 00:55:29.150 align:start position:0%
people
um

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
essentially I don't think Facebook
 
00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
should be the one fact checking things
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
Facebook is and others are blocking
 
00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:38.339 align:start position:0%
opinions I believe
 
00:55:38.339 --> 00:55:38.990 align:start position:0%
opinions I believe
um

00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
Zuckerberg at some point in front of the
 
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in front of Congress or
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
someone told them essentially the fact
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
checks are an opinion by Facebook they
 
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
don't want them to be legally binding I
 
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
suggest that because of their market
 
00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
dominance this is a limited bill it does
 
00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
not violate the constitution and is a
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
good thing because Facebook should not
 
00:55:59.690 --> 00:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
be the one deciding what is true speech
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
and what is not
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
thank you question for this Witness
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
so you know I guess I I just I in light
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
of one of your last thing I just have
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
one question I noted the the language
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
that you read on page three in section
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
2C says and I'm quoting any expression
 
00:56:19.569 --> 00:56:19.579 align:start position:0%
including obscene lewd lascivious filthy
 
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
excessively violent harassing or
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
otherwise objectionable so if I'm Pfizer
 
00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
and I think that people who have a view
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
that the difference in mind about the
 
00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
efficacy of the vaccine can I say under
 
00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
that section
 
00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:39.770 align:start position:0%
that section
um

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
this is objectionable and therefore
 
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
Facebook or Google or whatever take it
 
00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:47.150 align:start position:0%
Facebook or Google or whatever take it
down

00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
I guess the court would decide who on
 
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
that one um
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
I guess different language were proposed
 
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
um I guess I don't think
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
this is a difficult question I think it
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
judged my in Facebook at the end of the
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
day be the one deciding that
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
other questions for this week
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
all right do we have any other Witnesses
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I'm going to close
 
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:21.660 align:start position:0%

on HB uh 171 give me just one second
 
00:57:38.089 --> 00:57:38.099 align:start position:0%

and I will recognize uh representative
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:52.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I appreciate it

esteemed colleagues of the Judiciary
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
Committee my name is Bill Boyd I
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
represent uh Hillsborough District 12 in
 
00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
the town of Merrimack and I am
 
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
presenting to you house bill 171 which
 
00:58:14.329 --> 00:58:14.339 align:start position:0%
was presented to me by request by my
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
constituent Robert bevel who's sitting
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
right behind me
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
um the goal of 171 is to clarify
 
00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:27.500 align:start position:0%
language in the existing statute 507 B
 
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
seeking to do one of seeking to do two
 
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
things one is it relates to New
 
00:58:35.569 --> 00:58:35.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire case ever versus General
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
Electric it's going to codify language
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
that was used in that decision you'll
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
see that in reflected on lines 9 through
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
11 of your bill and then it seeks to
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
redact language that was in the city of
 
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
Dover decision which you're going to see
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
on lines 16 through 20. the perp purpose
 
00:58:56.089 --> 00:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
of these particular changes is to add
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
Clarity to to the St to the statute to
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
to better provide
 
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
um intent of what the of what the
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
statute is meaning to do uh as it
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
relates to its Authority
 
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.450 align:start position:0%
relates to its Authority
um

00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday
 
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
um a stakeholders meeting occurred
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
trying to gain Clarity and consensus on
 
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
on the language in this in this bill
 
00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:23.329 align:start position:0%
on the language in this in this bill
reluctantly

00:59:23.329 --> 00:59:23.339 align:start position:0%
reluctantly
 
00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:26.339 align:start position:0%
um neither of that occurred
 
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
um not for the want of trying the
 
00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
process was certainly collegial so we're
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
here today with the bill as is for your
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
for your review I'll do my best to
 
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
answer any questions my my knowledge is
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
limited I would defer to my constituent
 
00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:44.339 align:start position:0%
um but I'll leave it at that Mr chairman
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
questions for for this Witness
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
I guess I do have one uh questions
 
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:54.059 align:start position:0%
report it it does seem like at least
 
00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:55.460 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
elimination of the language that is
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
currently in 507 B2
 
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
that this would
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh and that that language generally
 
01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:07.910 align:start position:0%
uh and that that language generally
limits

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
limits
 
01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:10.700 align:start position:0%
um uh the circumstances in which
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
liability can be predicated against a
 
01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
correct municipality to uh vehicle and
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
property this would eliminate that which
 
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
would it would seem to me at least
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
initially would sort of
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
pretty significantly expand the basis of
 
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
Municipal liability that would be
 
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.089 align:start position:0%
Municipal liability that would be
correct

01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
and I take it you you have no concern
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
with doing that or you think that's a
 
01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:38.579 align:start position:0%
good idea that I I don't have an opinion
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
oh I as I as I said at the onset I'm I'm
 
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
presenting the bill on behalf of my
 
01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:45.740 align:start position:0%
constituent okay I was here to explain
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
more about about the reason why he chose
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
to add and redact as it relates to the
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
statute right thank you okay any other
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness thank you
 
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:57.780 align:start position:0%

um

01:01:05.809 --> 01:01:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%

good morning your honors uh Judge Lynn

committee thank you for hearing me again
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
got a haircut since yesterday if you
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't recognize me it's a lot a lot
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
lighter thank you so uh I'll start off
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
my name is Bob bevel I live at 12 Blair
 
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
Road Merrimack New Hampshire I'm coming
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
for myself but I also work with a
 
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
network of parents of special needs
 
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
children I'm not legal counsel for any
 
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
of them but they have addressed some
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
concerns let me answer your question
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
first judge in that um
 
01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
yes that would open up the floodgates if
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
we move the the portion regarding
 
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
vehicles and premises but in my opinion
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
this particular spot in the statutes and
 
01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
all the statute this is the improper
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
place for this because it's trying to
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
accomplish two things one is that the
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
statute is supposed to be
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
protecting you our legal our
 
01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
Representatives when you make decisions
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
it is in what's called a discretionary
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
function you're making a decision on
 
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
whether the highway is built on the left
 
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
side of the property or on the right
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
side of the property
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
and in such you should be protected for
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
full immunity for making those decisions
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
because you're making decisions in the
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
interests of the people
 
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
however there are state and local
 
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
employees who do not make discretionary
 
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
decisions they are doing ministerial
 
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
tasks uh sweeping floors uh filing
 
01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
papers that kind of stuff that do not
 
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
fall under what the intention of this
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
bill was a lot of this is because uh was
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
in response to a case back in the 70s
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
where that the court the Supreme Court
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
was looking at eliminating the state
 
01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
created and the Judiciary created
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
position of Municipal liability or
 
01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
Municipal immunity and there are so many
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
flavors out there I won't get into that
 
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
I can more answer your questions but the
 
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
purpose of Merrell versus Manchester was
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
to chop that down and to go more to
 
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
what's already codified
 
01:03:28.089 --> 01:03:28.099 align:start position:0%
in response to that the uh the
 
01:03:33.049 --> 01:03:33.059 align:start position:0%
legislature created 507 B2 and then
 
01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
later on the court in city of Dover
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
found that to be unconstitutional and
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
struck it down and then again uh the
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
legislature tried to put something back
 
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
in to cover uh uh things having to do
 
01:03:47.809 --> 01:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
with arising out of ownership occupation
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance or operation of all motor
 
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
vehicles and all premises
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
so I will be submitting written
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
testimony later because I just didn't
 
01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
have time you can't see this here but um
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
there are many parents that are
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
concerned with special needs kids that
 
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
are coming through I guess I kind of
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
dropped the ball when I was talking to
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders on Tuesday in that I
 
01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
started off talking about it having to
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
do with the bullying statute that was
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
more of as an example of many parents
 
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
have gotten very involved in their
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
legislature and are advocating for their
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
kids last year one of the new things was
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
to add to the bullying statute 193 f a
 
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
section which allows for a private right
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
of action If the parents see that
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
something's not going forward they can
 
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
file a private right of action but
 
01:04:38.329 --> 01:04:38.339 align:start position:0%
because under the way 507b is already
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
written just because you have a right to
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
that summary judgment is still going to
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
go against you because in some cases the
 
01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
judges put together the indemnity in the
 
01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:48.980 align:start position:0%
first part of
 
01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
507b2 with the part of five and say
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
practically unless you run somebody down
 
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
with a truck or something falls on them
 
01:04:58.849 --> 01:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
at a premise no one has the ability to
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
peer uh Municipal liability and and
 
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm I'm here is to to deal
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
with that so I looked at the the
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
definition of the methodology that was
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
written by the committee um support
 
01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
staff and it's a very good definition
 
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
it's basically pointing out that this
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
opens up the door for the ability for
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
live lawsuits against ministerial
 
01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
employees that's already the case what
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing with this legislation is
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
codifying what are the exact uh Court
 
01:05:31.609 --> 01:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
decisions that support that so there are
 
01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:33.299 align:start position:0%
several cases that are out there for
 
01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:34.940 align:start position:0%
example Everett versus General Electric
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
tilted versus Doherty shop versus city
 
01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
of Somersworth and hacking versus town
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
of Belmont one of the best examples of
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
this I'd like to read from hacking
 
01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
versus town of Belmont elevating the
 
01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
decisions of a referee and coaches in
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
the course of an elementary school
 
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
basketball game to the level of
 
01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
government planning or policy formation
 
01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
would indeed undermine the rule of
 
01:05:59.450 --> 01:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
Merrell establishing immunity as the
 
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
exception accordingly we hold that the
 
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
trial court did not air in denying the
 
01:06:04.609 --> 01:06:04.619 align:start position:0%
motion to dismiss on the grounds that
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
the decisions of the referees and Coach
 
01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
were not entitled to discretionary
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
function immunity several times the
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has already signaled the
 
01:06:15.289 --> 01:06:15.299 align:start position:0%
legislature please fix this law it's
 
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
hard to understand we're having trouble
 
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
I presented this with Bill Boyd's help
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
last year under house bill 1034 some of
 
01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
you may have remembered that I see
 
01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
there's new members on the committee
 
01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:27.500 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is not take away
 
01:06:29.809 --> 01:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
the rights of the people who are already
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
entitled by law what we're trying to do
 
01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
is eliminate the confusion for who is
 
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
entitled to it so the difference being
 
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
discretionary versus immunity the
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
language being added as Bill Boyd aptly
 
01:06:46.809 --> 01:06:46.819 align:start position:0%
said uh in lines 9 through 11 come from
 
01:06:49.609 --> 01:06:49.619 align:start position:0%
the decision in Everett versus General
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
Electric and the portion from 16 versus
 
01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
20 comes from the Dover decision thank
 
01:06:56.089 --> 01:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
you for your time
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes
 
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander
 
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
um my concern or is on line 10 the the
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
ad that says is not made in one in
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
Reckless manner want to Reckless Manor
 
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
is a violation of a right of another
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
person correct um so my question is if a
 
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
planning or zoning board makes a
 
01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.029 align:start position:0%
planning or zoning board makes a
decision

01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
um it perhaps an uneducated decision
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
because they don't know the proper
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
um like RSA or or like direction from
 
01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:30.299 align:start position:0%
the legislature would that qualify as
 
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
wanting a reckless Manner and then
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
um compel the person whose rights are
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
violated to sue the town for that thank
 
01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
you I'll do my best
 
01:07:45.049 --> 01:07:45.059 align:start position:0%
um I try not to to overburden people so
 
01:07:45.059 --> 01:07:46.670 align:start position:0%
um I try not to to overburden people so
uh

01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
under under Prosser the decision under
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
Section 132 for that is that the usual
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
meaning of willful wanting to Reckless
 
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
is that the actor has intentionally done
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
an act of an unreasonable character in
 
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
disregard of a known or obvious risk
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
that was so great as to make it highly
 
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
probable that harm would follow in your
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
situation no that would not follow that
 
01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
yes so would you be opposed to adding
 
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
intentional somewhere in here or do you
 
01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
think it do you think the language is is
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
explainable except itself I'm amenable
 
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
to whatever the committee thinks again
 
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to do was that the the
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
court has signaled several times to the
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
legislature this needs to be fixed and
 
01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
again I'm not opposed to the language of
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
of liability
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
um protection for things on premises or
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles but having it included in 507b
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
adds to the confusion because when you
 
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
read from the top down
 
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
you can naturally put them together and
 
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
that is not the purpose of this one is
 
01:08:49.739 --> 01:08:50.749 align:start position:0%
that is not the purpose of this one is
about

01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
exemption from being sued by an
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
individual for whatever job they're
 
01:08:58.130 --> 01:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
doing is versus something that would be
 
01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:59.229 align:start position:0%
doing is versus something that would be
uh

01:08:59.229 --> 01:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
ipsilocators you know something falls
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
off the building or you know somebody
 
01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
slips because the floor wax is a little
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
too too much those are things you don't
 
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
expect to happen what's driving me for
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
this is the parents parents are having
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
their children
 
01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
in seclusion they're having restraint
 
01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
used against them they're being bullied
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
when things don't go the way of the
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
school district and some decisions for
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
the school they call dcyf on parents and
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
they don't have any reaction there's no
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
teeth to protect parents when actions
 
01:09:32.329 --> 01:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
are happening against their kids uh so
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
for the example that I found
 
01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
recently was that a school principal and
 
01:09:40.249 --> 01:09:40.259 align:start position:0%
a special ed teacher didn't like a
 
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
response from a special ed kid and they
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
dragged the child on his back the length
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
of two football fields through the halls
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the school it was captured on video
 
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
the principal tried to delete the
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
evidence she admitted to doing the
 
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
charges and then she was suspended it
 
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
took the school district two years to
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
fire her and in the meantime the little
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
boy's parents uh missed out on a lawsuit
 
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
because of the governmental immunity
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
that exists in Tennessee this is a
 
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
problem in many many states is that the
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
liability that is meant for you as our
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
elected officials who are doing the
 
01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
discretionary functions of setting
 
01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
policy and making decisions are being
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
benefited by those who it's not at
 
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
purposes so I'm also going to anticipate
 
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
the question is wasn't this going to
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
open up The Floodgate Of lots of
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and lots of costs
 
01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
school districts already play into a a
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
primary pool with primex they have
 
01:10:39.169 --> 01:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
insurance for it so
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
if we're if we're not going to be able
 
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
to sue them based upon the law why are
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
we paying Insurance anyway and the
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
second piece is if if it's open there
 
01:10:51.169 --> 01:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
then you be start to have a financial uh
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
incentive like whoa now we've opened the
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
flood dates our insurance is going to go
 
01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
up because now we're getting the
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuits maybe we need to change our
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
method that accomplishes the same thing
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you your honor
 
01:11:04.729 --> 01:11:04.739 align:start position:0%

I'll try to keep this very brief as I
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
know you're probably already behind
 
01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.090 align:start position:0%
know you're probably already behind
schedule

01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
I represent the New Hampshire Police
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
Association and the New Hampshire
 
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
Troopers Association today as a former
 
01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:53.219 align:start position:0%
uh detective Sergeant with the New
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police Our concern that
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have with this bill is obviously that
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
it might be overreaching and what I mean
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
by that is uh as the constituents said
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
opening the floodgates I think there's a
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
potential for a lot of unintended
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
consequences as a result of this
 
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
uh the other concern I also have as a
 
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and as a property owner here in
 
01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if you're a municipal
 
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
insurance rate goes up who pays for that
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
that's going to be coming under my
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
property taxes and I don't know about
 
01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
the rest of you but my property taxes
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
are pretty high as they are right now so
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's another concern that we have I
 
01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
think this uh could more easily be
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
addressed if uh under
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
um another statute such as 193 uh if
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's the bullying issue that he's
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about or issues with liability
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
within the school system and not having
 
01:12:47.689 --> 01:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
it overreaching over all public
 
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
employees so those are just some of the
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
concerns that our associations have and
 
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to bring that to your
 
01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
attention with that I'm willing to take
 
01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
any questions you might have questions
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you uh you know I
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
guess I do have uh I'm sorry
 
01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
I am very conscious of the time and but
 
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
you said something that
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
interested me
 
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
um in that you talked about the fact
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
that your taxes are high and you don't
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
want them to be any higher
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
um Are there specific expenses that you
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate
 
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
um that you have to pay taxes for if not
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
one to provide insurance coverage for
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
certain categories of public employees
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
no absolutely I I think uh you know you
 
01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
pay taxes in order to have a government
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
and the government to run and for
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
services and within your town uh the
 
01:13:45.169 --> 01:13:45.179 align:start position:0%
town that I live in uh we do have great
 
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
Services we have great schools however
 
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's that saying you know
 
01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
Death By A Thousand Cuts you know if you
 
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
raise something over here and then you
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
raise something over here and yeah in it
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
of itself it's not a big deal uh I
 
01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
believe it then thank you it is
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have insurance
 
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
um but you know we should try to do the
 
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
best that we can at mitigating the
 
01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:08.209 align:start position:0%
best that we can at mitigating the
expenses

01:14:08.209 --> 01:14:08.219 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative Perez
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
um you said you thought it was
 
01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
overreaching can you give me an example
 
01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
of what you mean by why you think it
 
01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
might be overreaching
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
well I think it's overreaching because
 
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
this affects if he's if the constituent
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
is truly looking at just a school issue
 
01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
and School Employees I don't think it
 
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
needs to apply to all employees uh also
 
01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:35.219 align:start position:0%
concerned with the language that's being
 
01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
struck uh which uh would open up some
 
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
liability uh when it comes to the areas
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
that you can file a lawsuit under
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
um you know when you take out take away
 
01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
that particular language
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
other questions I do have one question
 
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
I'd be interested in your I mean one
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
thing that
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
I I'm not I'm not so clear that the
 
01:14:59.330 --> 01:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
prior witness who said that the Supreme
 
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
Court at least in recent decisions has
 
01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
been saying you ought to change the law
 
01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
we in this area I'm not quite sure
 
01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
unless they've said something very
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
recently that I'm not aware of but but
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
beyond that the one thing that I think
 
01:15:10.199 --> 01:15:11.209 align:start position:0%
beyond that the one thing that I think
is

01:15:11.209 --> 01:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
very true and I'm wondering what your
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
view on this would be
 
01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
the law is different
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
um at least to some extent of the
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances under which state the
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
state or its employees can be held are
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
subject to immunity versus Municipal uh
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities and Municipal Employees
 
01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if you think
 
01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
um it would make sense to change the law
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
to eliminate that so in other words the
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
immunity the immunity statute would
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
apply equally to both the state and its
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
actors state police officers you know
 
01:15:53.689 --> 01:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
for example the Department of
 
01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:56.300 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and to
 
01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
municipalities and their actors
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
selectment planning board members local
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
police officers
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
all I can say uh in reference to that is
 
01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
uh the concern uh specifically in law
 
01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement that we have at this issue
 
01:16:13.729 --> 01:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
is the attack on official immunity right
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
now you have a recruitment and retention
 
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
issue within law enforcement we're
 
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
having a hard time bringing in new
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
police officers and we're having a hard
 
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
time retaining the ones that we have
 
01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you if there was something
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
that we're going to negatively affect
 
01:16:29.209 --> 01:16:29.219 align:start position:0%
official immunity in that in that
 
01:16:29.219 --> 01:16:30.189 align:start position:0%
official immunity in that in that
respect

01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
respect
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
that would get even harder you know as a
 
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
police officer I was willing to put my
 
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
life on the line to protect others I'm
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
not willing to put my family's life in
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
their livelihood on the line for that
 
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
and so that's one of the main concerns
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
we have is law enforcement I don't know
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
if that answers your question but I
 
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
think that you know you'd have to
 
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
obviously study this and look at this in
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
a sense that if you're going to combine
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
the two you don't want to have any
 
01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that come out as
 
01:16:59.689 --> 01:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
a result of that so I I guess I'm not
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
opposed to it but I'd be very careful on
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
how I do it sure no I understand other
 
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you thank
 
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
you members
 
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
um Marissa Chase
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Association for
 
01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:27.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.169 --> 01:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:32.699 align:start position:0%
committee um I apologize it's a Thursday
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of session so bopping
 
01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
around a little bit for the record my
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
name is Marissa Chase I'm the executive
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
director for the New Hampshire
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
Association for justice which is a
 
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
euphemism for the trial lawyers we have
 
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
about 400 members Statewide who practice
 
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
across the board with a small collegial
 
01:17:50.209 --> 01:17:50.219 align:start position:0%
bar like New Hampshire you can imagine
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
most Law Offices Encompass many
 
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
different practice areas that includes
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
personal injury medical malpractice
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
family law workers compensation this is
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
kind of all to say that our members
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
would love to be a resource I myself am
 
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer so if you have a question
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
for me that I cannot answer I can
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely find someone who can
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
um so we worked on this bill a little
 
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
bit last session with representative Mr
 
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
attorney Beville and representative Boyd
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
and I believe our intent was aligned but
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
the language last session and I
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
apologize for not having the house bill
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head
 
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
um did not accomplish it and that's all
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
because this area of case law and the
 
01:18:31.729 --> 01:18:31.739 align:start position:0%
statutory framework that has been
 
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
interpreted by case law
 
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
is extremely confusing and complicated
 
01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:37.490 align:start position:0%
is extremely confusing and complicated
um

01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
we are in support of this bill today and
 
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
I'm passing I passed out testimony that
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney Megan Douglas had emailed you
 
01:18:45.649 --> 01:18:45.659 align:start position:0%
the kind of lays out
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
how we got here and why
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
um I want to note I won't go through her
 
01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
testimony as representative Lynn said
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
earlier I know you all can read and can
 
01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
follow up with any questions you may
 
01:18:59.330 --> 01:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
have the one thing I would note is that
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
immunities are
 
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
pretty much why our organization exists
 
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
to oppose them
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
our belief is that the only immunity you
 
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
need is to act responsibly lawyers
 
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
especially in this state do not
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
file lawsuits frivolously or without
 
01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
careful thought it's a business decision
 
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
for them lawyers take personal injury
 
01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
cases on contingency fee which means
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
they front the cost of litigation before
 
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
filing a suit I'd also note that about
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
99 of cases in New Hampshire settle
 
01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:33.500 align:start position:0%
pre-suit before a lawsuit is even filed
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
as I said it's an economic decision so
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
unless there are damages that exist that
 
01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
are going to make it worth all the time
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
and cost of litigation a lawsuit's not
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
going to occur it's kind of a
 
01:19:47.209 --> 01:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
self-correcting problem to negate that
 
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
fear that some Floodgate Of litigation
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
would open I just don't see that
 
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
happening so that's all I have to say
 
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
for now again if you have any questions
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
I will do my best to answer it and if I
 
01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer now I will follow
 
01:19:58.260 --> 01:19:59.450 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer now I will follow
up

01:19:59.450 --> 01:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
next I would call on uh
 
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
match uh I keep either your handwriting
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
has to get better or my or my ability to
 
01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:17.060 align:start position:0%
read that's crazy
 
01:20:19.729 --> 01:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
I'm certain it's my handwriting Mr chair
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
well I don't know it may be my eyesight
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
too it's uh it's nature like nature gray
 
01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
is like the color
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
um I know we're a little behind
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
um say that I agree with everything that
 
01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
that the detective Sergeant set up here
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
um we we at the municipal Association do
 
01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
um I just note that 507b has coexisted
 
01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
for decades with other immunities
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
granted by the court and the case that
 
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
is uh supposedly being put into the
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
statutes here is about 15 years old
 
01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
um and our reading of it is that uh
 
01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:58.390 align:start position:0%
um and our reading of it is that uh
the

01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
essentially what this bill would do is
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
not just add the uh that language from
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
that case into the statute but it
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
broadens the scope of Municipal
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
liability and that could open up the the
 
01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
gates to additional lawsuits
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
particularly in property and vehicle
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
related incidents because we're dealing
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
with ministerial immunity here
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
um I believe Mr chair you you asked
 
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.750 align:start position:0%
um I believe Mr chair you you asked
whether

01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:27.590 align:start position:0%
whether
um

01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
we thought you asked the detective
 
01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
Sergeant whether um it was true that the
 
01:21:35.689 --> 01:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
the state and Municipal line immunities
 
01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
don't quite line up
 
01:21:41.209 --> 01:21:41.219 align:start position:0%
um I would I would agree with that
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
um it's a very complicated issue as
 
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
we've heard from other Witnesses today
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that there's no
 
01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
unintentional consequences uh from any
 
01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
sort of changes because this is a
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
complex area of law both because of the
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
statutory language and because of the of
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
the cases
 
01:22:00.719 --> 01:22:02.270 align:start position:0%
the cases
um

01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
to the extent you may have suggested
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court uh whether
 
01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
they've been asking that the law should
 
01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
be changed statutorily or not
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
I would say they have not been
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I think the law as as is is
 
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:18.229 align:start position:0%
um I think the law as as is is
appropriate

01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and the example we heard for the
 
01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
impetus for this change really comes
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
from an example from Tennessee if I
 
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
understood correctly about a principle
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
and another
 
01:22:34.370 --> 01:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
um teacher dragging a student down the
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
hallway by their foot to me that
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
certainly seems like a crime and should
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
be referred to the criminal justice
 
01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:42.590 align:start position:0%
be referred to the criminal justice
system

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:44.219 align:start position:0%
um it would not
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
fall in the realm of the Civil Justice
 
01:22:48.169 --> 01:22:48.179 align:start position:0%

okay thank you
 
01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure we're all familiar with the
 
01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment the state
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
passed in 2018 with a substantial
 
01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:57.470 align:start position:0%
passed in 2018 with a substantial
majority

01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
that states an individual's right to
 
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
live free from governmental intrusion in
 
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
private or personal information is
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
natural essential and inherent
 
01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
this like the Constitution this
 
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
amendment is aspirational and I believe
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
that there I don't believe there are two
 
01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
ways that we can put flesh if you will
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
on this there's the judicial approach
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
where a court case comes up and if it
 
01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
impinges on the Constitutional Amendment
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
or statutory law they'll rule in some
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
way the other approach which I think is
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
a better one is a legislative approach
 
01:25:37.729 --> 01:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
where we try to Define what this
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
aspirational uh
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
statement means
 
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
so with that as some background I'll go
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
to the to the bill and try to go through
 
01:25:50.209 --> 01:25:50.219 align:start position:0%
it with you and at a fairly high level
 
01:25:53.209 --> 01:25:53.219 align:start position:0%
and before I get to the goals of the
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
bill I want to touch on the definitions
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
since they're very important to both
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
simplifying and clarifying the
 
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
underlying language of the bill
 
01:26:05.689 --> 01:26:05.699 align:start position:0%
so the first definition is personal
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
information and this is things like your
 
01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
name you address your social security
 
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
number but more than that it's things
 
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
like what a phone company keeps in terms
 
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
of records that relate to your phone
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
calls so they keep records for building
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
purposes that include who you called how
 
01:26:23.689 --> 01:26:23.699 align:start position:0%
long the call lasted and that sort of
 
01:26:25.729 --> 01:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
thing so those that's one example of one
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
of the things that comes under the
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
notion of personal information
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
the next definition is third party
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
providers of information and services so
 
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
this is basically those phone companies
 
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
and and others that build up databases
 
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
of information that's related to their
 
01:26:41.639 --> 01:26:43.070 align:start position:0%
of information that's related to their
business

01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
um but that's related to their business
 
01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
the third definition and this is a one I
 
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
added we added in conjunction with the
 
01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:56.219 align:start position:0%
last hearing this bill hat or similar
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
Bill had last year
 
01:27:00.669 --> 01:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
the notion of government entity
 
01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
previously the bill included lists in
 
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
various places related to government
 
01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
entities and that was confusing to folks
 
01:27:09.169 --> 01:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
is you know what's the do we have the
 
01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
total list here is it there and that
 
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
sort of thing so the government entity
 
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
is basically any state
 
01:27:19.129 --> 01:27:19.139 align:start position:0%
our County or Municipal entity and their
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
employees and then we'll use that term
 
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
through the document and the AG's office
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
helped me to work with AG's office to
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
help me develop that
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
that definition and usage
 
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
so the goals of the bill are twofold the
 
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
first one and I'm going to read it it's
 
01:27:39.169 --> 01:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
line 24. except as otherwise provided in
 
01:27:39.179 --> 01:27:40.010 align:start position:0%
line 24. except as otherwise provided in
law

01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
an individual shall have a reasonable
 
01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy in personal
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
information including content and usage
 
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
given or available to third-party
 
01:27:52.729 --> 01:27:52.739 align:start position:0%
providers and of information and
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
services and not available to the public
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
so right there you can see the use of
 
01:27:59.570 --> 01:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
some of those definitions so that the
 
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
language of the statement is fairly
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
simple and straightforward once you
 
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
understand the definitions and the
 
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
intent of this is going back to that
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
phone company example
 
01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
under current law and court rulings
 
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
the phone company can provide that
 
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
information to law enforcement or pretty
 
01:28:20.050 --> 01:28:20.060 align:start position:0%
much anybody
 
01:28:22.970 --> 01:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
this statement in conjunction with the
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
we believe uh precludes that now there
 
01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
of course will be exceptions to that and
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'll come to that because obviously law
 
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
enforcement that's probably one of your
 
01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
questions we'll come back to that one
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
but otherwise it's fairly
 
01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
straightforward statement regarding the
 
01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:40.139 align:start position:0%
who that personal information belongs to
 
01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
and it's basically the person who made
 
01:28:44.689 --> 01:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
the phone call or what other other uh
 
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh information is being held in
 
01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.570 align:start position:0%
uh information is being held in
databases

01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
databases
 
01:28:50.209 --> 01:28:50.219 align:start position:0%
the second goal of the bill is to
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
preclude governments at all levels
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
government entities from maintaining
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
databases uh personal information that
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
are not relevant to their statutory or
 
01:29:04.669 --> 01:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
constitutional responsibilities so just
 
01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:08.219 align:start position:0%
just read that one as well on line 24 no
 
01:29:10.729 --> 01:29:10.739 align:start position:0%
government entity shall acquire collect
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
retain or use any personal information
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
of any individual residing in New
 
01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:19.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from any third party provider
 
01:29:22.729 --> 01:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
okay now obviously that would preclude
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
the government's doing a lot of their
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
jobs so there need to be exceptions to
 
01:29:28.729 --> 01:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
in the case of both of these goals to
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
acceptance to them so the government can
 
01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
perform their jobs and I won't go
 
01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
through each of the exceptions but they
 
01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
continue from the rest of page one on
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
down to line 20 on page two and these
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
were worked out in conjunction with the
 
01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
state agencies and other agencies of
 
01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
government over the last four years
 
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh most recently so I worked with the
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
I worked with the banking commissioner I
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
worked with fish and game and other
 
01:29:57.770 --> 01:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
agencies of state government and most
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
recently I worked with the Attorney
 
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
General's office so I mentioned earlier
 
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
that helped me to find a government
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
entity and they also indicated that the
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
inquiries by Grand Jury the exception on
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
line 20 was important as well so we
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
added that one in there
 
01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:14.229 align:start position:0%
added that one in there
foreign

01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
as previously uh
 
01:30:21.649 --> 01:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
presented was what are you guilty of and
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
what are the penalties for being guilty
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
of that so and again here's where the uh
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office is very
 
01:30:30.649 --> 01:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
helpful to me and first of all
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
separating those two issues and then
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
clarifying how they're expressed so line
 
01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
21 talks about what are you guilty of
 
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
what's the infraction and essentially if
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
you're a person like me or you
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
um it's a violation if you're other on
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
any other type of entity it's a
 
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor so not particularly serious
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh crimes but to put some teeth into the
 
01:30:58.129 --> 01:30:58.139 align:start position:0%
bill itself so there's so there's some
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
consequence for violating the terms of
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
um now we get to the Penalty and this is
 
01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
an online 23 I'm just going to read it
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
because it only applies to government
 
01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:10.430 align:start position:0%
because it only applies to government
entities

01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
a person who suffers injury as a result
 
01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
of a violation of this chapter shall be
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
titled to damages from the government
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
entity responsible for the violation of
 
01:31:20.209 --> 01:31:20.219 align:start position:0%
not less than a thousand dollars for
 
01:31:22.370 --> 01:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
each violation and so on
 
01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
so it's only penalizing government
 
01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:28.139 align:start position:0%
entities who know oh I should have added
 
01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
in I was not careful to point out in
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
line 21 any person who knowingly
 
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
violates the provisions and that's
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
something else that the Attorney
 
01:31:36.649 --> 01:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
General's office pointed out needed to
 
01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
be in there so if you're accidentally
 
01:31:39.890 --> 01:31:39.900 align:start position:0%
violating it you're not guilty of
 
01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:42.550 align:start position:0%
violating it you're not guilty of
anything

01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
the online 26 and this goes to the
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
business Community
 
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
um previously the bill listed out some
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
some things here and folks said well I'm
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
not I don't know what kind of you know
 
01:31:57.050 --> 01:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
you didn't list my business so as before
 
01:31:59.689 --> 01:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
I defined government entity the AG's
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
office said well just use the term
 
01:32:03.530 --> 01:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
non-government entity so that will refer
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
to everything else whether you're a
 
01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
for-profit not-for-profit sub chapter S
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
Sub chapter C sole proprietorship you
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
know whatever and it states this chapter
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
shall not be construed to create a cause
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
of action against a non-government
 
01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
entity for providing information to a
 
01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
government entity so this is not
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
intended to impact the business
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
Community other than the goal number one
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
which is the information or about your
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
phone calls and that sort of thing is
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
private to you
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh and lastly I'll touch on the
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
regulation biometric information just to
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
tell you why that's there when OLS uh
 
01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
reviewed this bill a few years ago they
 
01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
recognized there's a relationship
 
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
between this and RSA 359 and colon 2
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral IC so they added that in
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
to account for that relationship
 
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
so that's my overview of the bill I
 
01:32:55.610 --> 01:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
would just point out that I did upload a
 
01:32:57.890 --> 01:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
more detailed in-depth description of
 
01:33:01.129 --> 01:33:01.139 align:start position:0%
the underpinnings of the bill to your
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative greeson thank you Mr
 
01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you sir for uh answering
 
01:33:18.649 --> 01:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
our questions just for clarity can you
 
01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:20.090 align:start position:0%
our questions just for clarity can you
define

01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
define
 
01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:24.780 align:start position:0%
uh in in lines 21 and 22 of page two any
 
01:33:26.570 --> 01:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
person who knowingly violates the
 
01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
provisions of this section shall be
 
01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
guilty of a violation if a natural
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
person or guilty of a misdemeanor if any
 
01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
other person is this a
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
is this the crime against Aretha
 
01:33:38.810 --> 01:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
Franklin who feels like a natural woman
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
or what are we talking about here so is
 
01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
this play on words is that kind of your
 
01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:43.370 align:start position:0%
this play on words is that kind of your
question

01:33:43.370 --> 01:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not an attorney okay I'm a
 
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
lowly software developer but this is the
 
01:33:51.649 --> 01:33:51.659 align:start position:0%
legal language that I was instructed was
 
01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
appropriate to use and my understanding
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
just my understanding that if some
 
01:33:57.169 --> 01:33:57.179 align:start position:0%
attorneys speak later perhaps they can
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
qual confirm this or not a natural
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
person is a you or me an actual what I
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
would call a person
 
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
um and any other person it would be a
 
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
corporation for instance someone more
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
more important than us there you go if
 
01:34:13.729 --> 01:34:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:16.550 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
um

01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
my question is probably more properly
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
directed to the
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
chairs and the clerk's office but um you
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
did mention the butler did mention the
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
online portal and I've used it to submit
 
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
stuff but um how do we retrieve that
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
stuff do you know how we go about
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
actually seeing this information that
 
01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
you submitted through this online portal
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're killing me so unfortunately I'm
 
01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
on the finance committee and we don't
 
01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
even work who the people that I think
 
01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
you're responsible for that I just
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
assumed you can get access to it if you
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
can't I would be happy to
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
if I could just the chair is can't do
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
anything on this bill so
 
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
um if I could just point out to
 
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
representative hargen and to everybody
 
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
else new systems have glitches both old
 
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
and new and there is an information
 
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
technology office and representative
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
hargen is very familiar with that office
 
01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
and if you are having problems reaching
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
any of these sites that supposedly exist
 
01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
to help us but that doesn't necessarily
 
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
work that way they should deal with
 
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
information technology to help get them
 
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
to where they have to be
 
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
could I just since I have the microphone
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
um follow-up
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
my mind is going I have to admit that
 
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
um I read this bill and I keep on
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
thinking of situations we had before
 
01:35:51.649 --> 01:35:51.659 align:start position:0%
this committee last year
 
01:35:51.659 --> 01:35:53.930 align:start position:0%
this committee last year
where

01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:35:58.129 --> 01:35:58.139 align:start position:0%
um entities came in and wanted to use
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
information that had been collected for
 
01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
a particular purpose
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
but use that information for another
 
01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.030 align:start position:0%
but use that information for another
purpose

01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
covered in this or am I being too
 
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
general for you to be able to answer
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
um last year there was a question having
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
to do really with um specific property
 
01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:23.149 align:start position:0%
to do really with um specific property
boundaries

01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
boundaries
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.310 --> 01:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
not for others that could violate
 
01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:38.570 align:start position:0%
not for others that could violate
privacy

01:36:38.570 --> 01:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm not familiar with a particular
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
issue you're talking about first of all
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
you're talking about government or
 
01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:46.729 align:start position:0%
you're talking about government or
non-government

01:36:46.729 --> 01:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
non-government
 
01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:48.179 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:36:50.410 --> 01:36:50.420 align:start position:0%
government information
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
that other government agencies wanted to
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
use even though the information was
 
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
available to agency one for very
 
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
particular purpose
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
well I guess my answer would be and if
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
it needs to be clarified I'd leave that
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
in your hands but I guess my answer
 
01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
would be if the other government agency
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
needs it for a statutory or
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional purpose then that comes
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
under the exceptions that are included
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
here I I that would be my
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
contention I'm not a lawyer thank you
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's a very unfair question I didn't
 
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
mean to do it that way that's okay
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative tour
 
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks
 
01:37:33.169 --> 01:37:33.179 align:start position:0%
um just looking at uh it looks like sort
 
01:37:36.169 --> 01:37:36.179 align:start position:0%
of the active parts of this are uh
 
01:37:40.850 --> 01:37:40.860 align:start position:0%
uh 507 H2 one and two the first one says
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
that you should have an expectation of
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
privacy and information held by third
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
party providers the the sort of active
 
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
part of it says no government entity
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
shall acquire collect retain so I'm just
 
01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
wondering where is the onus of this is
 
01:37:58.129 --> 01:37:58.139 align:start position:0%
it on the companies that hold the third
 
01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
party information not to just turn it
 
01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:04.139 align:start position:0%
over to government entities or is it on
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
the government entities not to ask or on
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
the government entities to keep track of
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
why each piece of information that they
 
01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
happen to have came to them and what
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
it's there for so if that makes sense it
 
01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:18.780 align:start position:0%
makes total sense so it's on the
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
government entity and if you go to page
 
01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:24.659 align:start position:0%
two line 26 this chapter shall not be
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
construed to create a cause of action
 
01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
against a non-government entity for
 
01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
providing information to a government
 
01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:33.830 align:start position:0%
providing information to a government
entity

01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
if that answers your question about the
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
business side of things being impacted
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think it does and so the
 
01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
government entity then needs to maintain
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
some sort of justification about why
 
01:38:48.050 --> 01:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
they so then are they are they
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
prohibited from asking for the
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
information are they prohibited from
 
01:38:54.169 --> 01:38:54.179 align:start position:0%
maybe related to what representative
 
01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
Smith was asking using it for some other
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
purpose or not knowing why they have it
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
is who prevented prohibited from asking
 
01:39:05.209 --> 01:39:05.219 align:start position:0%
the government entity yes yes
 
01:39:07.570 --> 01:39:07.580 align:start position:0%
yes I mean they need to know and and
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
consultation with government entities
 
01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:11.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
PG's office the banking commissioner
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
they know what they need what kind of
 
01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
data they need to fulfill their
 
01:39:18.770 --> 01:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
constitutional or statutory
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so they should not be
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
asking and they have never and they have
 
01:39:25.729 --> 01:39:25.739 align:start position:0%
not expressed a problem with not asking
 
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:36.050 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative

01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
chairman Wallace and members of the
 
01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
House Judiciary Committee my name is
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
John Williams I am the legislative
 
01:39:58.129 --> 01:39:58.139 align:start position:0%
director for the New Hampshire
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Human Services and
 
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to come before this
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
committee today uh uh to speak on the
 
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
bill HB
 
01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
um 314 is a work product that
 
01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative erf and others have
 
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
committed some time and energy
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative former representative
 
01:40:17.090 --> 01:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
Neil Kirk actually you may recall
 
01:40:19.250 --> 01:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
brought similar legislation before this
 
01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
committee you could look at this bill
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
that in terms of a purpose statement the
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
adoption of the state of the importance
 
01:40:29.689 --> 01:40:29.699 align:start position:0%
of the protection of privacy and private
 
01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
information of individuals is extremely
 
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
important not only to our agency but to
 
01:40:37.850 --> 01:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
the state and it has been codified or
 
01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
rather rather put into the state's
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
Constitution as it relates to personal
 
01:40:44.689 --> 01:40:44.699 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights so in an effort to
 
01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
creating good legislation it is when a
 
01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
legislator does their homework and I
 
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
will say in this case representative erf
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
and representative former Representative
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
no Kirk invited uh various state
 
01:40:58.250 --> 01:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
agencies into the process to work with
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
them to ensure that it honors the
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
commitment to protecting personal
 
01:41:03.530 --> 01:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
information but at the same time
 
01:41:05.930 --> 01:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
allowing New Hampshire's state agencies
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
to deliver both at a regulatory level
 
01:41:10.610 --> 01:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
but also an administrative level the
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
services that benefit our state citizens
 
01:41:15.050 --> 01:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
and I would say that representative erf
 
01:41:16.610 --> 01:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
has done that and accomplished it at
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
least to our state agency's perspective
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
on page one starting on lines 26 through
 
01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:25.340 align:start position:0%
29 which sets forth the first exemption
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
within the legislation under a sub uh
 
01:41:31.250 --> 01:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
paragraph a it's very clear that there's
 
01:41:33.530 --> 01:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
two connections here it applies to State
 
01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:35.699 align:start position:0%
agencies in their Regulatory and
 
01:41:37.609 --> 01:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
administrative functions but then in
 
01:41:39.229 --> 01:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
terms of the collection retention and
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
use of that it has to be for a purpose
 
01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
that that state of Aging see I will
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
Undertake and it has to be specifically
 
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
for its functions either regulatory
 
01:41:52.209 --> 01:41:52.219 align:start position:0%
investigative rather investigative
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory or administrative functions
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
there's also a recognition here on a
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
federal preemption which we think is
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
also very important and I would perhaps
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
think that a conversation with the
 
01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice probably was had
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
with representative Kirk and I'm kind of
 
01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:09.179 align:start position:0%
looking back for knowing not on why that
 
01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
was included so what I would say to
 
01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
other entities that are out there who
 
01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
would like to collaborate with the bill
 
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
sponsors that they have done a really
 
01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
great job in making themselves very open
 
01:42:25.129 --> 01:42:25.139 align:start position:0%
and available to at least the very state
 
01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
agencies in terms of participating to
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
ensure the balance of protection of
 
01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
privacy and the ability to do our job uh
 
01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
meaningfully here in the state so I'd
 
01:42:35.930 --> 01:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
invade anybody who probably might be
 
01:42:37.490 --> 01:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
coming after me who might have different
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
perspective than I'm articulating before
 
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
this committee that uh I would encourage
 
01:42:43.970 --> 01:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
them strongly to work with the Bill's
 
01:42:45.890 --> 01:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
sponsor they've been open to this
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
process throughout for the last several
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
years most recently in the prior bill
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
that this committee passed out on an
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
18-3 vote back in 2021 it was a retained
 
01:42:58.450 --> 01:42:58.460 align:start position:0%
Bill eventually made its way through
 
01:43:02.090 --> 01:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
2022 that was houseboat 597. we think
 
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
that work product that was worked there
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
has been carried over to this bill and
 
01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
we want to thank the sponsors for
 
01:43:09.050 --> 01:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
bringing this important bill before you
 
01:43:10.609 --> 01:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
again we're not taking a specific
 
01:43:13.129 --> 01:43:13.139 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but as it relates
 
01:43:15.050 --> 01:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
to our agency we're fine with
 
01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:16.910 align:start position:0%
to our agency we're fine with
legislation

01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:24.070 align:start position:0%
legislation
foreign

01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:43:39.890 --> 01:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
committee for holding this hearing today
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
just for the record my name is Ross
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
Connolly I'm the deputy state director
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
for Americans for Prosperity here in New
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire here to voice our support for
 
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
HB 314 as was mentioned by the previous
 
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
speaker this has been a bill that has
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
been fine-tuned over a couple sessions
 
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
now and really uh give a lot of credit
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
to to representative erf and uh
 
01:44:04.729 --> 01:44:04.739 align:start position:0%
honorable Neil Kirk for for really
 
01:44:07.129 --> 01:44:07.139 align:start position:0%
finding a way that this bill Works to
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
protect uh the the granite Slater's
 
01:44:12.649 --> 01:44:12.659 align:start position:0%
right to privacy but also that balance
 
01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:15.659 align:start position:0%
with how uh state agencies work so in
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
the respective time I'll try to be be
 
01:44:21.530 --> 01:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
brief and not not repeat uh but as uh
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative erf mentioned in 2018 uh
 
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
Granite Slater's overwhelmingly uh
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
supported a an amendment to our
 
01:44:31.729 --> 01:44:31.739 align:start position:0%
constitution to protect uh privacy
 
01:44:35.209 --> 01:44:35.219 align:start position:0%
specifically from from government uh and
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
there's uh not much right now in statute
 
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
backing that right up so this bill seeks
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
to achieve that goal of really trying to
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
protect uh Granite stater's right to
 
01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:48.470 align:start position:0%
protect uh Granite stater's right to
privacy

01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned this bill does not uh
 
01:44:53.090 --> 01:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
ban the collection of data by government
 
01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
agencies or private entities that simply
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
puts in guard rails in place uh to
 
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
ensure that that those Technologies are
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
not being abused since as we've seen
 
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
over the years especially the past few
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
years across the world that uh use of
 
01:45:12.649 --> 01:45:12.659 align:start position:0%
data and and collection of data can be
 
01:45:15.169 --> 01:45:15.179 align:start position:0%
abused in in enormous ways and and
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
violate individual rights
 
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
to Representatives representative erf's
 
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
earlier uh Point uh that this can be
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
achieved through through the courts or
 
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
through legislation uh I'll just
 
01:45:31.930 --> 01:45:31.940 align:start position:0%
reference that we we think that
 
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
legislation really needs in in this
 
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
space especially needs to be Forward
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
Thinking and uh responsive to
 
01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
constitutional changes and and changes
 
01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:43.860 align:start position:0%
in technology and we think this this
 
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
bill achieves that we want to make sure
 
01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
that government can do its important job
 
01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
but also respecting those those
 
01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
individual rights and as former or as
 
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
current uh U.S uh Supreme Court
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
associate Justice Alito stated in Riley
 
01:46:04.129 --> 01:46:04.139 align:start position:0%
versus United States uh in 2018 he said
 
01:46:06.169 --> 01:46:06.179 align:start position:0%
in these developments it would be very
 
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
unfortunate if privacy protection in the
 
01:46:11.090 --> 01:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
21st century were left primarily to the
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
federal courts using the blunt
 
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
instrument of the Fourth Amendment
 
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
legislators elected by the people are in
 
01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
a better position to assess and respond
 
01:46:21.649 --> 01:46:21.659 align:start position:0%
to changes that have already occurred
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
and that uh almost certainly will take
 
01:46:25.390 --> 01:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
place in the future
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons uh you know we
 
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
think that this bill and bills like it
 
01:46:34.370 --> 01:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
are really the best Avenue to to back up
 
01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
this this right to privacy for for
 
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
granite Staters uh and we encourage the
 
01:46:41.090 --> 01:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
committee to to move this bill out to
 
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
pass and I'd be happy to take any
 
01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
any questions for the witness
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%

01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you again members of the committee
 
01:47:06.890 --> 01:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh I was informed that I may
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
not have been close enough to the mic
 
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
last time so uh we'll Endeavor to do
 
01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.090 align:start position:0%
last time so uh we'll Endeavor to do
better

01:47:11.090 --> 01:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
um again I apologize I did rely on the
 
01:47:15.290 --> 01:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
online portal to submit my written
 
01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:16.430 align:start position:0%
online portal to submit my written
testimony

01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%

um but I can make sure to uh to get that
 
01:47:20.090 --> 01:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
to the to the rest of the committee
 
01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:21.830 align:start position:0%
to the to the rest of the committee
members

01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
um again my name is Christopher gilraine
 
01:47:27.050 --> 01:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
I represent TechNet in the Northeast we
 
01:47:29.330 --> 01:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
are a trade Association of companies
 
01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the Innovation ecosystem
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
privacy is uh of major importance uh to
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
my members uh we support clear statutes
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
that allow our customers to understand
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
their rights and our companies to
 
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
establish compliance structures that
 
01:47:46.970 --> 01:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are within the
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
bounds of the law
 
01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
to that end uh we I appreciate uh the uh
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
concept of putting some more statutory
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
meat on the bone to back up the
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
Constitutional amendment to provide more
 
01:48:05.090 --> 01:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh information and more definition
 
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I am here uh simply to express my
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
members concern that in their opinion uh
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
the bills requirements are still not
 
01:48:20.090 --> 01:48:20.100 align:start position:0%
exclusively limited to government actors
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
or data provided to government by Third
 
01:48:25.570 --> 01:48:25.580 align:start position:0%
parties specifically
 
01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
H2 Roman numeral one the expectation of
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
privacy it's a broad and subjective
 
01:48:37.129 --> 01:48:37.139 align:start position:0%
standard that's usually applied to the
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
right of individuals to be protected
 
01:48:40.970 --> 01:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
against unreasonable search and seizure
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
by government it's unclear if this does
 
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
in fact apply to the broader private
 
01:48:49.729 --> 01:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
sector how that can be interpreted and
 
01:48:53.209 --> 01:48:53.219 align:start position:0%
created uh into a compliance structure
 
01:48:55.330 --> 01:48:55.340 align:start position:0%
that anticipates every individual's
 
01:48:57.770 --> 01:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
expectation of how their data is is
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
being used
 
01:49:02.570 --> 01:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
um again this is with the understanding
 
01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:03.590 align:start position:0%
um again this is with the understanding
that

01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:06.530 --> 01:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
um you know despite the additional uh
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
changes that have been made uh and the
 
01:49:11.689 --> 01:49:11.699 align:start position:0%
uh sponsors Clarity on this um that we
 
01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
do believe that that uh Roman numeral
 
01:49:16.729 --> 01:49:16.739 align:start position:0%
one still does apply to the broader uh
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
private sector uh and we are concerned
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
about how one would a company would come
 
01:49:25.010 --> 01:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
into compliance with that expectation uh
 
01:49:28.609 --> 01:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
if that is the case then the private
 
01:49:30.890 --> 01:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
right of action uh enforcement mechanism
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh becomes really really difficult when
 
01:49:35.689 --> 01:49:35.699 align:start position:0%
you've got a statute that is vague and
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
difficult to comply with enforced via
 
01:49:40.609 --> 01:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
class action lawsuit you see massive
 
01:49:43.129 --> 01:49:43.139 align:start position:0%
liability for New Hampshire companies uh
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
you see companies pulling back on these
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of services that they will offer
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
in the state in order to try and avoid
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
those lawsuits and ultimately it's a
 
01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
Payday for class action firms and very
 
01:49:58.729 --> 01:49:58.739 align:start position:0%
little benefit to the residents of New
 
01:50:00.290 --> 01:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire capture and this is not
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
speculation we've seen seen this in
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
Illinois with the Biometrics uh privacy
 
01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
statute small businesses uh facing class
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
action lawsuits for unwitting or
 
01:50:12.410 --> 01:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
unknowing violations of a vaguely
 
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
defined statute
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
companies pulling back uh in in Illinois
 
01:50:19.609 --> 01:50:19.619 align:start position:0%
case uh it's uh smart home features
 
01:50:21.410 --> 01:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
things that are available to the rest of
 
01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
the country but not Illinois for fear of
 
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
running into this Statute in New
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under this statute I I would
 
01:50:31.129 --> 01:50:31.139 align:start position:0%
imagine since there is not a exemption
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
for uh fraud prevention and security
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
that we see in most Omnibus privacy
 
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
statutes that you'd start to see those
 
01:50:42.169 --> 01:50:42.179 align:start position:0%
kinds of services being curtailed
 
01:50:42.179 --> 01:50:43.129 align:start position:0%
kinds of services being curtailed
um

01:50:43.129 --> 01:50:43.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:45.410 --> 01:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a uh you know
 
01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
well-earned and well-deserved reputation
 
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
as a business-friendly state
 
01:50:51.290 --> 01:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
um there's few things that are more
 
01:50:53.450 --> 01:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
toxic to business than a vague statute
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
enforced via class action lawsuit
 
01:50:58.250 --> 01:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
um again this is all predicated on our
 
01:51:01.010 --> 01:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
Our concern again that is it is not
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
exclusively limited to government actors
 
01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
and data provided to government so we're
 
01:51:08.810 --> 01:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
happy to work with the sponsor and with
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
the committee um to to get some more
 
01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
clarity on that we want to be a resource
 
01:51:15.410 --> 01:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
in that regard
 
01:51:17.209 --> 01:51:17.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:17.219 --> 01:51:21.290 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.209 --> 01:51:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
like in opposition is because you feel
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
that there's too much third party
 
01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
ambiguity and if that
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
were fixed in an amendment
 
01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't be opposing the bill
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I think our key concern is that
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
that Roman numeral one the expectation
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
of privacy applies broadly to everybody
 
01:51:48.410 --> 01:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
who handle like all entities that handle
 
01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:50.450 align:start position:0%
who handle like all entities that handle
data

01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:51:52.729 --> 01:51:52.739 align:start position:0%
um so we you know we've been involved in
 
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
Omnibus privacy statutes uh in other
 
01:51:55.260 --> 01:51:56.750 align:start position:0%
Omnibus privacy statutes uh in other
states

01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:52:00.169 --> 01:52:00.179 align:start position:0%
um and what we seek is some clear
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
definitions you know what are the
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
consumers rights what are the
 
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the entity that
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
holds the data and that way you can
 
01:52:10.010 --> 01:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
create a compliance structure that that
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
keeps you in compliance with the law and
 
01:52:15.050 --> 01:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
protects consumers uh in the case of you
 
01:52:17.209 --> 01:52:17.219 align:start position:0%
know a expectation of privacy it really
 
01:52:20.689 --> 01:52:20.699 align:start position:0%
hinges on an individual's uh what they
 
01:52:22.250 --> 01:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
believe should be done with their data
 
01:52:24.890 --> 01:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
or not done uh and it's an it's hard to
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
create a compliance structure that that
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
anticipates that
 
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:34.310 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
chair

01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
um so the the words expectation of
 
01:52:38.689 --> 01:52:38.699 align:start position:0%
privacy literally are now in our
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
constitution right so
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
I'm confused because I'm I'm looking on
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
page two line 2627 accident action
 
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
against non-government entity
 
01:52:51.410 --> 01:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's it's saying it's very clear right
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
that you cannot be sued
 
01:52:56.450 --> 01:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
if you provide information to a
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
government entity so I'm I'm really just
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
trying to understand where where is the
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
vagueness in this bill yeah so that that
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh that exemption
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
um the way that I and people smarter
 
01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
than me read it um was that it it
 
01:53:12.050 --> 01:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
applies exclusively that exemption
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
applies exclusively to government uh or
 
01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
to data provided by a non-government
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
entity to a government entity and then
 
01:53:22.129 --> 01:53:22.139 align:start position:0%
that is exempt from from the class
 
01:53:25.129 --> 01:53:25.139 align:start position:0%
action but the overall expectation of
 
01:53:25.139 --> 01:53:26.750 align:start position:0%
action but the overall expectation of
privacy

01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:27.709 align:start position:0%
privacy
um

01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
is not exempt so if a company fails to
 
01:53:36.290 --> 01:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
live up to an individual's expectation
 
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
of how their data will be handled by a
 
01:53:40.850 --> 01:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
private Corporation it is our
 
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
understanding that that is not exempt
 
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions for this Witness
 
01:53:52.970 --> 01:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
saying none we thank you
 
01:53:55.129 --> 01:53:55.139 align:start position:0%

okay

01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%

Commerce and leading non-partisan
 
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
business Advocate Bia strongly opposes
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 314 which is essentially if
 
01:54:51.649 --> 01:54:51.659 align:start position:0%
not virtually identical to HB 597 that
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate sent to interim Study last
 
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.250 align:start position:0%
the Senate sent to interim Study last
year

01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:54:58.729 --> 01:54:58.739 align:start position:0%
the belief is that HB 314 is built on
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:00.590 align:start position:0%
the same
um

01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:03.410 --> 01:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
big and overly broad definition of
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
personal information and features the
 
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
same troubling language regarding
 
01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:09.060 align:start position:0%
constitutional and statutory
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
expectations of privacy
 
01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
the ambiguous term content and usage of
 
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
personal information is one of the most
 
01:55:18.890 --> 01:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
troubling aspects especially as the
 
01:55:21.410 --> 01:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
legislation would Grant a right a
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
private right of action
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
um remaining a problem is the inclusion
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
of third-party prop providers and
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
contractors as it appears to extend
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
coverage to non-government entities
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
despite the Bill's intent
 
01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:37.990 align:start position:0%
despite the Bill's intent
um

01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:40.609 --> 01:55:40.619 align:start position:0%
h3314 creates a new right to an
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy for certain
 
01:55:45.890 --> 01:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
conduct and types of information for
 
01:55:48.129 --> 01:55:48.139 align:start position:0%
which there is no definition
 
01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't clearly State what
 
01:55:52.970 --> 01:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
constitutes a violation nor does it
 
01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
provide a reasonable right to cure a
 
01:55:57.770 --> 01:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
violation before a cause of action is
 
01:55:57.780 --> 01:55:59.390 align:start position:0%
violation before a cause of action is
instituted

01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
instituted
 
01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh HB 13 314 much like last year's
 
01:56:06.770 --> 01:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
version uh lacks expected exemptions for
 
01:56:08.590 --> 01:56:08.600 align:start position:0%
entities and types of information
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
already subject to federal law and
 
01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:13.310 align:start position:0%
already subject to federal law and
regulations

01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
um it uh the belief is like last year's
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
version this bill is too flawed uh to
 
01:56:23.090 --> 01:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
advance and we ask that you do not move
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
this bill forward
 
01:56:26.570 --> 01:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions at this
 
01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:28.310 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions at this
time

01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:56:30.169 --> 01:56:30.179 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for this witness
 
01:56:33.470 --> 01:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you thank you
 
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair nature Grace for the
 
01:56:49.970 --> 01:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
municipal Association apologize for you
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
having to see me so many times today
 
01:56:55.609 --> 01:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
um we do oppose this bill as written
 
01:56:57.169 --> 01:56:57.179 align:start position:0%
um we're concerned with unintended
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
consequences uh that that may arise from
 
01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
the language as it exists now
 
01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
um particularly within the realm of law
 
01:57:04.199 --> 01:57:05.810 align:start position:0%
um particularly within the realm of law
enforcement

01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
um obviously businesses and law
 
01:57:10.370 --> 01:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
enforcement share information and we
 
01:57:12.649 --> 01:57:12.659 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that any legislation
 
01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
that gets passed does get it right so
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
that we don't end up in a situation
 
01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
where we cannot get Justice for victims
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
um and I do want to thank representative
 
01:57:25.729 --> 01:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
erf he has reached out we have been
 
01:57:27.649 --> 01:57:27.659 align:start position:0%
talking with him we are hopeful that we
 
01:57:29.570 --> 01:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
can come to an agreement on how to
 
01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:30.530 align:start position:0%
can come to an agreement on how to
resolve

01:57:30.530 --> 01:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
resolve
 
01:57:32.330 --> 01:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
um some of the issues that we've
 
01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:33.770 align:start position:0%
um some of the issues that we've
identified

01:57:33.770 --> 01:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
identified
 
01:57:35.570 --> 01:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
um so I I really do want to thank him
 
01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
for that uh we are hopeful that that we
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
will end up coming to some sort of
 
01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
compromise but as written we we do
 
01:57:45.169 --> 01:57:45.179 align:start position:0%
oppose this legislation I'm happy to
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
take any questions that you that you may
 
01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.950 align:start position:0%
take any questions that you that you may
have

01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative Earth and
 
01:58:00.770 --> 01:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn have submitted this
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
bill to the Judiciary Committee so it is
 
01:58:07.070 --> 01:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
now in our control
 
01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
um would you be willing to share with us
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
the changes that you would like this
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee to make in order to get your
 
01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:18.179 align:start position:0%
support since in fact neither
 
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
um all the representative Lynn will have
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
a vote and will be able to participate
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
in the executive session
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
um he cannot participate today in
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative Earth will not have a
 
01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:30.050 align:start position:0%
representative Earth will not have a
vote

01:58:30.050 --> 01:58:30.060 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh sure so we were um concerned
 
01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:36.589 align:start position:0%
uh sure so we were um concerned
um

01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:38.689 --> 01:58:38.699 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the concerns we had
 
01:58:41.810 --> 01:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
was there wasn't a definition for what
 
01:58:43.609 --> 01:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
is publicly available
 
01:58:45.890 --> 01:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
um so one of the questions that came up
 
01:58:48.589 --> 01:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
was there are situations where something
 
01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
might be behind a paywall
 
01:58:52.729 --> 01:58:52.739 align:start position:0%
um and therefore you know if I'm a
 
01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
member of the public I can go pay 14 for
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
the information
 
01:58:59.350 --> 01:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
um is the government allowed to do that
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
so we'd like it to be clear that that
 
01:59:05.450 --> 01:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
would not be a barrier to the government
 
01:59:07.609 --> 01:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
getting that information and I
 
01:59:09.169 --> 01:59:09.179 align:start position:0%
understand that the concerns that
 
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative erf would would have I
 
01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for him
 
01:59:15.050 --> 01:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
um but I understand obviously his
 
01:59:16.970 --> 01:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
concerns are he doesn't want a company
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
that has gathered information for a
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
specific purpose providing a service to
 
01:59:24.169 --> 01:59:24.179 align:start position:0%
an individual to provide that to the
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
government because that's what he's
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
trying to protect so
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
um I don't have exact language available
 
01:59:33.649 --> 01:59:33.659 align:start position:0%
for you about how we would work that out
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
at this moment in time but I'd be more
 
01:59:39.410 --> 01:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
than happy to share that once I if we
 
01:59:41.450 --> 01:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
can work something out
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you

major Joe Eber New Hampshire State

major Joe Eber New Hampshire State
Police

02:00:00.709 --> 02:00:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
both chairman uh
 
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
my name is Joseph Ebert it's e-b-e-r-t
 
02:00:10.250 --> 02:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
I'm a major with the state police I
 
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
oversee the Investigative Services
 
02:00:13.010 --> 02:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
Bureau which is your state police
 
02:00:13.020 --> 02:00:14.209 align:start position:0%
Bureau which is your state police
detectives

02:00:14.209 --> 02:00:14.219 align:start position:0%
detectives
 
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
so I come in to testify today uh
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
in agreement with the principals that
 
02:00:25.149 --> 02:00:25.159 align:start position:0%
this bill was submitted on we truly do
 
02:00:28.609 --> 02:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
uphold the right to personal privacy
 
02:00:32.890 --> 02:00:32.900 align:start position:0%
uh however I would as the prior speaker
 
02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
pointed out I would
 
02:00:38.689 --> 02:00:38.699 align:start position:0%
call some caution to the effect that
 
02:00:40.570 --> 02:00:40.580 align:start position:0%
this may have on law enforcement
 
02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
and as a member of law enforcement and
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who oversees the investigation
 
02:00:50.089 --> 02:00:50.099 align:start position:0%
of numerous numerous uh horrific crimes
 
02:00:52.189 --> 02:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
and crimes against persons I never want
 
02:00:55.010 --> 02:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
to take uh something away from one of
 
02:00:56.810 --> 02:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
the investigators that may bring Justice
 
02:00:59.689 --> 02:00:59.699 align:start position:0%
to one of the victims and although I
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the intention of this
 
02:01:01.199 --> 02:01:02.109 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the intention of this
bill

02:01:02.109 --> 02:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
what I would say is we would be
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
certainly agreeable to working with
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
representative and The Honorable Neil
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
Kirk to amend this bill uh
 
02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative Smith you had asked
 
02:01:17.930 --> 02:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
specifically what what would uh cause
 
02:01:19.729 --> 02:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
the prior speaker to be in support of
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
the uh I believe that we could achieve
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
that support
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
um if there was uh uh a definition given
 
02:01:31.729 --> 02:01:31.739 align:start position:0%
to that line 23 on page one and not
 
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
available to the public we share some of
 
02:01:36.850 --> 02:01:36.860 align:start position:0%
the same concerns as the prior speaker
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
also within line 27 on page page one
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
where it talks about a state regulatory
 
02:01:47.689 --> 02:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
or administrative agency and we would
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
ask your consideration of putting in a
 
02:01:52.189 --> 02:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
state investigatory agency
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
those would be the the two items that
 
02:01:57.050 --> 02:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
would cause us to come to a level of
 
02:01:58.970 --> 02:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
support for this bill and I'm happy to
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions at this time that
 
02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
I'm saying none thank you thank you very
 
02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:15.229 align:start position:0%
I'm saying none thank you thank you very
much

02:02:15.229 --> 02:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:33.410 --> 02:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon to you and to members
 
02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record I'm Neil
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
Kirk I live in Ware and I was a former
 
02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:46.189 --> 02:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
as has been indicated in prior testimony
 
02:02:47.689 --> 02:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
this bill has been before the
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
legislature a number of times and it's
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
passed the house in various forms
 
02:02:52.199 --> 02:02:53.530 align:start position:0%
passed the house in various forms
and

02:02:53.530 --> 02:02:53.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:59.390 --> 02:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
the reason why it's brought back is
 
02:03:05.930 --> 02:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.290 --> 02:03:08.300 align:start position:0%
the bill protects an individual
 
02:03:10.609 --> 02:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
informational privacy from government
 
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
and other intrusion
 
02:03:16.209 --> 02:03:16.219 align:start position:0%
it it does this through this concept of
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy which is
 
02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
something the court system federal and
 
02:03:23.209 --> 02:03:23.219 align:start position:0%
state has developed
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
and it only applies to situations where
 
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
an individual is dealing with a
 
02:03:34.370 --> 02:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
third party provider of goods and sorry
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
of information and services not Goods so
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't apply to Amazon this
 
02:03:41.689 --> 02:03:41.699 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply to Walmart but it would
 
02:03:43.609 --> 02:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
02:03:43.619 --> 02:03:44.149 align:start position:0%
apply to
um

02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:47.209 --> 02:03:47.219 align:start position:0%
a streaming service or
 
02:03:49.850 --> 02:03:49.860 align:start position:0%
a telephone company
 
02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
social media providers
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
the concept is
 
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
and this is the situation we're all
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
faced with in order to take advantage of
 
02:03:59.629 --> 02:03:59.639 align:start position:0%
many of these Services we give
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
information about ourselves and that's
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
defined in the bill the personal
 
02:04:05.810 --> 02:04:05.820 align:start position:0%
information your name your address your
 
02:04:07.490 --> 02:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
telephone number maybe your social
 
02:04:10.729 --> 02:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
security number in some cases it may be
 
02:04:13.010 --> 02:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
biometric information
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
and we give it to them so that they can
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
provide us the service the telephone
 
02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
service or the internet connection
 
02:04:20.570 --> 02:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
service whatever it might be and we
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
expect them to use that information for
 
02:04:24.109 --> 02:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
that purpose
 
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
but it seems that they are using this
 
02:04:29.390 --> 02:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
information for other purposes
 
02:04:31.850 --> 02:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
and government is able to access this
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
information at the discretion of the
 
02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:35.629 align:start position:0%
information at the discretion of the
provider

02:04:35.629 --> 02:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
provider
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
either on a simple request or even by a
 
02:04:42.189 --> 02:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
subpoena which of course doesn't require
 
02:04:45.770 --> 02:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
the same element of proof as a warrant a
 
02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
warrant requires a proof of
 
02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
probable cause which is a pretty high
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much higher standard to meet
 
02:04:55.970 --> 02:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
the question I think because some of you
 
02:04:58.010 --> 02:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
are new and perhaps have not seen this
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
bill before
 
02:05:02.089 --> 02:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
um the bill addresses an issue that's
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
come before the courts and the courts
 
02:05:06.649 --> 02:05:06.659 align:start position:0%
both federal and state are really in a
 
02:05:08.689 --> 02:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
state of confusion over this
 
02:05:10.609 --> 02:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
in the United States the Supreme Court
 
02:05:12.890 --> 02:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
has said based on the fourth amendment
 
02:05:14.689 --> 02:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
search and seizure
 
02:05:14.699 --> 02:05:15.950 align:start position:0%
search and seizure
that

02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:18.890 --> 02:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
there is no expectation of privacy
 
02:05:21.129 --> 02:05:21.139 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
personal information in third party
 
02:05:27.649 --> 02:05:27.659 align:start position:0%
providers of information and services
 
02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
so that means that the police if they
 
02:05:31.850 --> 02:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
want to go and get your telephone
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
records can go to the company Verizon
 
02:05:36.350 --> 02:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
and say please give us Neil Kirk's
 
02:05:38.450 --> 02:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
telephone records billing records and
 
02:05:40.189 --> 02:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
whatever else they might have not the
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
content of the calls to the extent that
 
02:05:44.209 --> 02:05:44.219 align:start position:0%
they may have recorded them but only the
 
02:05:46.250 --> 02:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
information where the call was made when
 
02:05:47.930 --> 02:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
it was made what number it was called to
 
02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
and everyone I called
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's the situation now under federal
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
law and the reason is that if there's no
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy then the
 
02:06:00.169 --> 02:06:00.179 align:start position:0%
provisions of the Fourth Amendment
 
02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
against search and seizure don't apply
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
so the police can or any government
 
02:06:08.030 --> 02:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
agency can go to these organizations and
 
02:06:09.050 --> 02:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
get whatever they want from them
 
02:06:10.970 --> 02:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
whatever the organization is willing to
 
02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:11.750 align:start position:0%
whatever the organization is willing to
give

02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
give
 
02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
in the case of a subpoena the
 
02:06:17.149 --> 02:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
organization is required to give it
 
02:06:17.159 --> 02:06:21.470 align:start position:0%
organization is required to give it
so

02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:23.229 --> 02:06:23.239 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court of the United States
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
in 2018 in the carpenter case
 
02:06:31.209 --> 02:06:31.219 align:start position:0%
slightly changed its concept of
 
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy when it found
 
02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:35.390 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy when it found
that

02:06:35.390 --> 02:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:37.550 --> 02:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
there was a reasonable expectation of
 
02:06:39.290 --> 02:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
privacy and cell tower location
 
02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:41.750 align:start position:0%
privacy and cell tower location
information

02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
okay so general rule no expectation of
 
02:06:46.609 --> 02:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
privacy and information you give to a
 
02:06:49.070 --> 02:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
third party provider except when it
 
02:06:51.950 --> 02:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
comes to cell phone or cell tower
 
02:06:55.250 --> 02:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.770 --> 02:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
so what that means is that third party
 
02:06:59.209 --> 02:06:59.219 align:start position:0%
providers can do what they want with
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
your information sell it to information
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
Brokers give it to a government official
 
02:07:03.599 --> 02:07:04.490 align:start position:0%
Brokers give it to a government official
Etc

02:07:04.490 --> 02:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
02:07:06.649 --> 02:07:06.659 align:start position:0%
what about New Hampshire
 
02:07:09.709 --> 02:07:09.719 align:start position:0%
again there's little statutory guidance
 
02:07:12.109 --> 02:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
this legislature is not told not
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
established a policy as to what to do
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
with this information
 
02:07:18.109 --> 02:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
and so what has the courts done
 
02:07:20.209 --> 02:07:20.219 align:start position:0%
well the Supreme Court and state versus
 
02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
Goss in 2003 said
 
02:07:25.550 --> 02:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
along with a minority of other states
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
that there was an expectation of privacy
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
in black plastic bags containing garbage
 
02:07:35.330 --> 02:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
left within three feet of the street for
 
02:07:35.340 --> 02:07:36.350 align:start position:0%
left within three feet of the street for
collection

02:07:36.350 --> 02:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
collection
 
02:07:38.570 --> 02:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
so that the police could not open the
 
02:07:38.580 --> 02:07:39.530 align:start position:0%
so that the police could not open the
bag

02:07:39.530 --> 02:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
bag
 
02:07:41.930 --> 02:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
look for its contents and use that
 
02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
contents to get a warrant to search the
 
02:07:47.390 --> 02:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:48.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:07:48.890 --> 02:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:07:50.689 --> 02:07:50.699 align:start position:0%
pretty good if you're interested in
 
02:07:52.609 --> 02:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
protecting privacy your garbage is
 
02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
private you put it out on the street
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
your expectation is that it goes to the
 
02:07:57.649 --> 02:07:57.659 align:start position:0%
dump and nobody's going to search it and
 
02:07:59.870 --> 02:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
use it we all know that of course kids
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
and others will sometimes go through it
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
but from a legal point of view the
 
02:08:05.209 --> 02:08:05.219 align:start position:0%
expectation was
 
02:08:07.129 --> 02:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
you were disposing of this in a secure
 
02:08:07.139 --> 02:08:08.810 align:start position:0%
you were disposing of this in a secure
manner

02:08:08.810 --> 02:08:08.820 align:start position:0%
manner
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
then in 2005 in the State versus
 
02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:13.490 align:start position:0%
then in 2005 in the State versus
gibatosi

02:08:13.490 --> 02:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
gibatosi
 
02:08:14.930 --> 02:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
the court
 
02:08:17.570 --> 02:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
in an interesting decision held that a
 
02:08:19.129 --> 02:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
subpoena to Verizon for telephone
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
billing records
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
did not create an expectation of privacy
 
02:08:25.669 --> 02:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
and therefore the state could get those
 
02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
records without having to prove that
 
02:08:30.050 --> 02:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
there was probable cause for them to
 
02:08:33.290 --> 02:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
need them no warrant was necessary
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
again this is only the record of the
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
call not the content
 
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
that was a 2-1-1 decision two judges
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
says yes there's no expectation of
 
02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
privacy a third judge said yeah I agree
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
with them but
 
02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
and then two other judges said no there
 
02:08:50.930 --> 02:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
is an expectation of privacy and
 
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
telephone records
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
the majority in its opinion said quote
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
nothing in today's decision prevents the
 
02:08:59.870 --> 02:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
legislature from closely regulating
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
subpoenas for phone records
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
and the concurring Justice chief justice
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
Broderick at that time said quote I
 
02:09:10.189 --> 02:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
would encourage the legislature to
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
examine whether telephone billing
 
02:09:13.370 --> 02:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
records should be protected from the
 
02:09:16.370 --> 02:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
reach of a prosecutor's subpoena not a
 
02:09:19.129 --> 02:09:19.139 align:start position:0%
warrant a subpoena
 
02:09:21.290 --> 02:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
the court has yet to consider the
 
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
implications of the recent privacy
 
02:09:24.729 --> 02:09:24.739 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
article part 1 article 2B an
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
individual's right to live free from
 
02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
government intrusion in private or
 
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
personal information is natural
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent
 
02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
in effect the court in the absence of
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
legislative guidance
 
02:09:44.450 --> 02:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
is all over the place
 
02:09:46.370 --> 02:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
both at the federal and the state level
 
02:09:49.550 --> 02:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
and so with all due respect to those who
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
might oppose this bill some guidance
 
02:09:54.109 --> 02:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
from this legislature is truly essential
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
so what does this bill do
 
02:10:03.290 --> 02:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
it clarifies the Constitutional
 
02:10:04.850 --> 02:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
Amendment with the legislative
 
02:10:06.649 --> 02:10:06.659 align:start position:0%
determination that the third party
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
Doctrine will not operate as an escape
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
hatch for third parties providers of
 
02:10:14.689 --> 02:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
Information Services to access personal
 
02:10:17.089 --> 02:10:17.099 align:start position:0%
information for purposes other than
 
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
providing the service promised the
 
02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:21.890 align:start position:0%
providing the service promised the
individual

02:10:21.890 --> 02:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
number two it provides that the police
 
02:10:26.330 --> 02:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
need the consent of the individual whose
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
data is sought or a search warrant
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
supported by probable cause
 
02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
02:10:35.209 --> 02:10:35.219 align:start position:0%
get that personal information the
 
02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
legislature would be protecting the
 
02:10:40.010 --> 02:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
privacy of that information
 
02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
there are exceptions in this bill State
 
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
agencies if the information is necessary
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
for them to fulfill their statutory
 
02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:48.169 align:start position:0%
for them to fulfill their statutory
responsibilities

02:10:48.169 --> 02:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
02:10:50.450 --> 02:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
obviously a warrant if there's probable
 
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
cause 9-1-1 calls emergencies where
 
02:10:56.570 --> 02:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
there is physical danger of death or
 
02:10:58.490 --> 02:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
severe physical injury
 
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
if there's some other statute that
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
happens to deal with this or where the
 
02:11:04.850 --> 02:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
individual consents but only for the
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
purpose for which he consents and for
 
02:11:09.709 --> 02:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
grand juries and there's a provision in
 
02:11:10.669 --> 02:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:11:14.209 --> 02:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
that a violation of the bill may bring a
 
02:11:16.010 --> 02:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
civil action
 
02:11:18.530 --> 02:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
we can only we can always improve this
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'm sure that if it were
 
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
to pass there would be changes that
 
02:11:23.810 --> 02:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
would come in the future
 
02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
but this represents a very solid
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
starting point for the State of New
 
02:11:29.450 --> 02:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to protect the Privacy the
 
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
informational privacy
 
02:11:33.729 --> 02:11:33.739 align:start position:0%
of its citizens
 
02:11:36.890 --> 02:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
there is one technical correction to the
 
02:11:40.430 --> 02:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
bill Mr chairman that I'd like to bring
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
to the committee's attention page one
 
02:11:44.209 --> 02:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
line 18.
 
02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
where it talks about government entity
 
02:11:49.669 --> 02:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
means online 18 after the after the
 
02:11:53.629 --> 02:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
third word or the word it's its no
 
02:11:56.810 --> 02:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
apostrophe should be placed so that
 
02:11:59.089 --> 02:11:59.099 align:start position:0%
employee elected official and contractor
 
02:12:01.850 --> 02:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
mean employee elected official or
 
02:12:04.129 --> 02:12:04.139 align:start position:0%
contractor as part of a government
 
02:12:04.139 --> 02:12:06.290 align:start position:0%
contractor as part of a government
entity

02:12:06.290 --> 02:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
entity
 
02:12:09.649 --> 02:12:09.659 align:start position:0%
and not private sector
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
that completes my testimony Mr chairman
 
02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
I'd be very pleased to answer questions
 
02:12:16.669 --> 02:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:18.770 --> 02:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn my understanding is
 
02:12:20.330 --> 02:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
since I didn't I'm allowed to either
 
02:12:22.370 --> 02:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
testify or ask questions since I didn't
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
testify I think I'm allowed to ask a
 
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
question so
 
02:12:28.609 --> 02:12:28.619 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman the tradition has been
 
02:12:31.609 --> 02:12:31.619 align:start position:0%
that a member a a member of the House
 
02:12:33.649 --> 02:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
who is a sponsor of the build
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
does not participate in any way in the
 
02:12:40.490 --> 02:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
um public hearing on the bill but may
 
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
participate in every way in the
 
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
committee's executive session voting
 
02:12:48.290 --> 02:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
providing amendments and making
 
02:12:50.089 --> 02:12:50.099 align:start position:0%
statements and I stand correct I thought
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
that I had read somewhere you could do
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
one or by one or the other but not both
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
works then okay all right
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
here it is so nice to hear a former
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice say I stand corrected you
 
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk
 
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you for doing what
 
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
you've done over the last decade for
 
02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
privacy in New Hampshire thank you sir
 
02:13:19.729 --> 02:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll conclude the hearing
 
02:13:26.930 --> 02:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
now we're up to Yes uh so we'll open the
 
02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
hearing then on HB
 
02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:37.550 align:start position:0%
hearing then on HB
149.

02:13:37.550 --> 02:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:52.609 --> 02:13:52.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:52.619 --> 02:14:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:11.290 --> 02:14:11.300 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and my
 
02:14:14.209 --> 02:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
distinguished colleagues on Judiciary it
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
is wonderful to see you from this view I
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
can see everybody it's terrific
 
02:14:24.169 --> 02:14:24.179 align:start position:0%
um and I am here to introduce uh House
 
02:14:28.250 --> 02:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
Bill 149 FN relative to the handling of
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
requests made under the right to no law
 
02:14:34.010 --> 02:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
02:14:36.530 --> 02:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
um that this is the first right to know
 
02:14:39.709 --> 02:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
Bill to come before
 
02:14:43.729 --> 02:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
um this uh 2023 session of the Judiciary
 
02:14:46.669 --> 02:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
Committee let me assure you that there
 
02:14:49.250 --> 02:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
will be many more to follow
 
02:14:55.010 --> 02:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
the state has tried over many years
 
02:14:58.970 --> 02:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
to develop a right to know system that
 
02:15:00.430 --> 02:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
02:15:05.290 --> 02:15:05.300 align:start position:0%
is uh uh accessible to the public
 
02:15:08.350 --> 02:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
understandable to the public that is
 
02:15:12.050 --> 02:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
transparent and accountable and because
 
02:15:15.890 --> 02:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
it is a very difficult task
 
02:15:18.649 --> 02:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
as difficult as protecting privacy as we
 
02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
heard before
 
02:15:24.770 --> 02:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
there are constantly needs that arise to
 
02:15:27.550 --> 02:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
refine and clarify
 
02:15:30.890 --> 02:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
the law for right to know in the state
 
02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
this bill comes forward not because of
 
02:15:39.950 --> 02:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
Any idle desire to just have another
 
02:15:42.890 --> 02:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
right to know Bill but because over the
 
02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:43.870 align:start position:0%
right to know Bill but because over the
years

02:15:43.870 --> 02:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
we see patterns on and practices that
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
might not completely reflect the
 
02:15:55.129 --> 02:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
underlying purpose of right to know
 
02:16:01.550 --> 02:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
and one reality is for whatever reason
 
02:16:04.490 --> 02:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
um legitimate or not and there are
 
02:16:09.370 --> 02:16:09.380 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons it is not always true
 
02:16:12.430 --> 02:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
that a public agency
 
02:16:15.770 --> 02:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
responds in a timely accurate and
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
thorough way to requests for information
 
02:16:21.890 --> 02:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
under right to know
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
it is a complicated business if it
 
02:16:26.689 --> 02:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
weren't we could have settled this in no
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
time at all
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
therefore this year's
 
02:16:35.929 --> 02:16:35.939 align:start position:0%
contribution at least from me is one
 
02:16:38.230 --> 02:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
that says
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
agencies experience problems in getting
 
02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
all the information out in a timely way
 
02:16:47.629 --> 02:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
we can understand that there are reasons
 
02:16:49.610 --> 02:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
legitimate or not but there are reasons
 
02:16:53.870 --> 02:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
for a delay all that this bill does is
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
say that if the agency has not been able
 
02:17:03.230 --> 02:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
to respond in a timely way it must
 
02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:04.870 align:start position:0%
to respond in a timely way it must
explain

02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
explain
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
why and do that in in a written report
 
02:17:12.049 --> 02:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
so that there is a record of why the
 
02:17:15.230 --> 02:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
agency had not been able to answer the
 
02:17:18.770 --> 02:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
request under right to know and it also
 
02:17:20.570 --> 02:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
says that
 
02:17:23.570 --> 02:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
um a 30 a 30-day limit seems to make
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
some sense but if you're not going to
 
02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
honor that 30-day limit then you have to
 
02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:29.709 align:start position:0%
honor that 30-day limit then you have to
uh

02:17:29.709 --> 02:17:29.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
the agency has to let the concerned
 
02:17:37.370 --> 02:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
individual know so it's just again a
 
02:17:39.530 --> 02:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
question of fine-tuning
 
02:17:42.889 --> 02:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
a very complicated issue that in the end
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
we'll never be able to be fine-tuned
 
02:17:49.310 --> 02:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
completely and thoroughly but each time
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we see a problem we try
 
02:17:57.049 --> 02:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
to narrow the um the effects of that
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
problem and I therefore present House
 
02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:01.810 align:start position:0%
problem and I therefore present House
Bill

02:18:01.810 --> 02:18:01.820 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:18:08.209 --> 02:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
149 to you and ask that you added to the
 
02:18:10.490 --> 02:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
long record of the house Judiciary
 
02:18:13.129 --> 02:18:13.139 align:start position:0%
Committee on trying to make sure that
 
02:18:15.770 --> 02:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
the citizens of this state can in fact
 
02:18:19.009 --> 02:18:19.019 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable knowing that right to
 
02:18:21.230 --> 02:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
know is Alive and Well in New Hampshire
 
02:18:24.169 --> 02:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh questions
 
02:18:29.089 --> 02:18:29.099 align:start position:0%
yes representative Greece thank you Mr
 
02:18:30.830 --> 02:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative Smith
 
02:18:33.169 --> 02:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
for this bill I do have one one question
 
02:18:35.690 --> 02:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
here at the end you have if statement of
 
02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
time exceeds 30 days uh then they can
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
request another 30 days
 
02:18:44.089 --> 02:18:44.099 align:start position:0%
is there would you be open to some
 
02:18:45.770 --> 02:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
amendment that would say that would
 
02:18:47.870 --> 02:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
prevent the stonewalling of just
 
02:18:49.969 --> 02:18:49.979 align:start position:0%
continually asking for 30 more days say
 
02:18:52.669 --> 02:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
you've got 90 days max you've got no
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
matter what you better get your act
 
02:18:56.209 --> 02:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
together within 90 days or whatever but
 
02:18:57.650 --> 02:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
something that just prevents the
 
02:19:00.469 --> 02:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
Perpetual stonewalling of uh we need 30
 
02:19:04.129 --> 02:19:04.139 align:start position:0%
more days I am completely sympathetic to
 
02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
what you say I understand the reality of
 
02:19:08.570 --> 02:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
what you say
 
02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
but my purpose here is not to
 
02:19:17.209 --> 02:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
um say my way or the highway my purpose
 
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
here is to try to move us
 
02:19:24.410 --> 02:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
however slowly towards a more perfect
 
02:19:27.650 --> 02:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
union and so I would
 
02:19:30.589 --> 02:19:30.599 align:start position:0%
not per although I'd only have one out
 
02:19:33.049 --> 02:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
of 20 votes and when this committee
 
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
considers this bill I'm not interested
 
02:19:38.450 --> 02:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
in setting up
 
02:19:38.460 --> 02:19:39.650 align:start position:0%
in setting up
um

02:19:39.650 --> 02:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:44.450 --> 02:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
uh boundaries that do not allow for a
 
02:19:46.610 --> 02:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
particular circumstance where it might
 
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
in fact be legitimate for there to be a
 
02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:50.570 align:start position:0%
in fact be legitimate for there to be a
delay

02:19:50.570 --> 02:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
delay
 
02:19:53.330 --> 02:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Tripp
 
02:19:54.889 --> 02:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:19:56.450 --> 02:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh I
 
02:20:01.550 --> 02:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
noticed on the uh towards the tail end
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the uh the change that the public
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
body uh
 
02:20:10.849 --> 02:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
whenever it's uh the 30-day time limit
 
02:20:14.410 --> 02:20:14.420 align:start position:0%
has exceeded that are they required or
 
02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:16.270 align:start position:0%
has exceeded that are they required or
uh

02:20:16.270 --> 02:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:19.929 --> 02:20:19.939 align:start position:0%
to submit another uh
 
02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
rationale as to why they can't provide
 
02:20:24.429 --> 02:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
the information
 
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um the language
 
02:20:32.810 --> 02:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
um on uh uh line 18 says shall provide
 
02:20:37.010 --> 02:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
it does not say may provide so
 
02:20:39.889 --> 02:20:39.899 align:start position:0%
um they are expected to provide and
 
02:20:42.889 --> 02:20:42.899 align:start position:0%
because it's written if what they tried
 
02:20:45.530 --> 02:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
to is someone in not acting in good
 
02:20:49.849 --> 02:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
faith just had a whole stack of
 
02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
um forms that said sorry we can't
 
02:20:53.160 --> 02:20:53.750 align:start position:0%
um forms that said sorry we can't
um

02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:56.450 --> 02:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
we can't comply with your request you
 
02:20:58.490 --> 02:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
know come back to us in 30 days
 
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
uh it would be a very short period of
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
time where that approach would be
 
02:21:04.319 --> 02:21:07.730 align:start position:0%
time where that approach would be
challenged

02:21:07.730 --> 02:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
02:21:12.650 --> 02:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
yes please okay so uh so there's uh
 
02:21:14.929 --> 02:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement on the person
 
02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
that asks the initial request to
 
02:21:20.450 --> 02:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
make another request
 
02:21:24.770 --> 02:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
to for the 30 days oh no they I I
 
02:21:28.730 --> 02:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
believe that the burden at this point is
 
02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
on the agency not on the individual
 
02:21:33.530 --> 02:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
making the request
 
02:21:36.050 --> 02:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Perez
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:40.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:21:40.130 --> 02:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:42.050 --> 02:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
right now there's a five-day business
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
day correct
 
02:21:46.370 --> 02:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
um that they have five days business
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
days to respond my only concern about
 
02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
the possibility of stretching it out 30
 
02:21:55.730 --> 02:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
days is um do you foresee any problem
 
02:21:58.190 --> 02:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
with things that really need to be
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
obtained in a timely manner because if
 
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
you have something that you need to
 
02:22:07.849 --> 02:22:07.859 align:start position:0%
receive in a timely manner for perhaps a
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
a meeting or a hearing
 
02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:12.469 align:start position:0%
a meeting or a hearing
um

02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:16.370 --> 02:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
this really could eliminate that
 
02:22:19.849 --> 02:22:19.859 align:start position:0%
um so do you see any problem with that I
 
02:22:24.050 --> 02:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
mean some 91 A's are submitted because
 
02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
you find out that you need that for a
 
02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:28.730 align:start position:0%
you find out that you need that for a
particular

02:22:28.730 --> 02:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:22:32.690 --> 02:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
thing that is going on and to wait 30 or
 
02:22:36.770 --> 02:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
60 days just you've lost the ability to
 
02:22:39.130 --> 02:22:39.140 align:start position:0%
obtain the information you need
 
02:22:43.969 --> 02:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
representative Perris yes I in all of
 
02:22:47.929 --> 02:22:47.939 align:start position:0%
right to know requests I see danger I
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
mean if I were you know a children's
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
book author I would
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
um I would have dangers of denials of or
 
02:22:58.610 --> 02:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
delays of writing our requests just
 
02:23:00.710 --> 02:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
filling the bedroom
 
02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:01.309 align:start position:0%
filling the bedroom
um

02:23:01.309 --> 02:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:01.319 --> 02:23:02.510 align:start position:0%
um
but

02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're adults and we're trying to do the
 
02:23:06.290 --> 02:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
right thing and we're trying to
 
02:23:08.030 --> 02:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
understand that sometimes there is a
 
02:23:11.690 --> 02:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason and uh we hope that
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
agencies will understand that right to
 
02:23:16.370 --> 02:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
know isn't going away and we hope that
 
02:23:18.290 --> 02:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
individuals will understand that
 
02:23:20.270 --> 02:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes there is a legitimate reason
 
02:23:23.870 --> 02:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
for a delay but in fact the agency would
 
02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
have to write
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
in writing
 
02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
what the what why why there is a delay
 
02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:32.690 align:start position:0%
what the what why why there is a delay
and

02:23:32.690 --> 02:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:32.700 --> 02:23:34.130 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:23:34.130 --> 02:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:34.140 --> 02:23:35.450 align:start position:0%
um
uh

02:23:35.450 --> 02:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:37.730 --> 02:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
in the fullness of time this all might
 
02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:39.650 align:start position:0%
in the fullness of time this all might
work

02:23:39.650 --> 02:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:42.730 align:start position:0%
work
please

02:23:42.730 --> 02:23:42.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:46.010 --> 02:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
reasonably necessary
 
02:23:49.309 --> 02:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
is there any way to tighten that up
 
02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
do you foresee anyway reasonably
 
02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:53.389 align:start position:0%
do you foresee anyway reasonably
necessary

02:23:53.389 --> 02:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:23:55.550 --> 02:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
um well representative Perez I would
 
02:23:58.490 --> 02:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
suggest that you go home and tonight
 
02:24:01.070 --> 02:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
instead of dreaming about right to know
 
02:24:04.969 --> 02:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
dream about reasonably necessary and
 
02:24:07.510 --> 02:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
prepare an amendment
 
02:24:11.090 --> 02:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
that and and we can talk for freshmen we
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
can explain how to get an amendment done
 
02:24:14.330 --> 02:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
because that I don't think has happened
 
02:24:16.130 --> 02:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
yet and we want you to understand how to
 
02:24:18.530 --> 02:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
do that and bring it into the committee
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
and say this is my Improvement on the
 
02:24:24.650 --> 02:24:24.660 align:start position:0%
bill and you'd be earning your 200 that
 
02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
way thank you thank you very much are
 
02:24:29.389 --> 02:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
there questions for this Witness
 
02:24:31.010 --> 02:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative Alexander thank you
 
02:24:32.809 --> 02:24:32.819 align:start position:0%
this is um thank you for taking my
 
02:24:32.819 --> 02:24:33.710 align:start position:0%
this is um thank you for taking my
question

02:24:33.710 --> 02:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:24:36.050 --> 02:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
um so I've served with you for four
 
02:24:38.450 --> 02:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
years now on this committee and
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to speak for what the
 
02:24:42.050 --> 02:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
committee is going to do but I do know
 
02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the past with right to know
 
02:24:47.690 --> 02:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
issues we've kind of aired on the side
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
of not specifying too much and not
 
02:24:55.010 --> 02:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
making everything so like written into
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
the law in the effort to allow
 
02:24:58.560 --> 02:24:59.150 align:start position:0%
the law in the effort to allow
um

02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:01.490 --> 02:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
litigation to occur so we can build up a
 
02:25:03.650 --> 02:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
case maybe a case file on right to know
 
02:25:05.570 --> 02:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
or you know allow an ombudsman to make a
 
02:25:07.849 --> 02:25:07.859 align:start position:0%
decision about
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
a right to no issue so my question to
 
02:25:13.490 --> 02:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
you is do you think that this
 
02:25:16.250 --> 02:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
would ever or could ever be
 
02:25:18.770 --> 02:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
hurting kind of the efforts we've made
 
02:25:20.210 --> 02:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
in the past to make sure that it's broad
 
02:25:21.530 --> 02:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
to allow for
 
02:25:25.130 --> 02:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
litigation if necessary
 
02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you for
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
the question I think it's a good
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
question as it's likely to be good
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
coming from you I think of the work that
 
02:25:36.050 --> 02:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
our colleague representative De Lorenzo
 
02:25:39.650 --> 02:25:39.660 align:start position:0%
has done on on getting an ombudsman in
 
02:25:39.660 --> 02:25:40.809 align:start position:0%
has done on on getting an ombudsman in
place

02:25:40.809 --> 02:25:40.819 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:25:44.570 --> 02:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
in issues relating to right to know and
 
02:25:47.809 --> 02:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
I would be very interested in in hearing
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
either from the Ombudsman or from from
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
others about whether this would rather
 
02:25:55.550 --> 02:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
than try
 
02:25:57.710 --> 02:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
to do what we hope it will do which is
 
02:26:01.250 --> 02:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
to encourage movement that it might
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
interfere in some way and if so we ought
 
02:26:08.450 --> 02:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:11.929 --> 02:26:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:14.330 --> 02:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
seeing that thank you very much thank
 
02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
02:26:20.210 --> 02:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
I'm going to next call on uh Giles
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
Bissonnet and you know I should note
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
um and I'll ask a record uh just in
 
02:26:28.250 --> 02:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
regards to the last to the last hearing
 
02:26:30.370 --> 02:26:30.380 align:start position:0%
um uh representative uh
 
02:26:33.290 --> 02:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
check the house rules and apparently
 
02:26:37.490 --> 02:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
rule 106 does say that a member that's a
 
02:26:39.710 --> 02:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor or a co-sponsor May either
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
testify or ask questions but can't do
 
02:26:44.510 --> 02:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
both so
 
02:26:48.110 --> 02:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
um and this house rules in this session
 
02:26:49.730 --> 02:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
it was one of the Amendments that had
 
02:26:51.770 --> 02:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
come up
 
02:26:53.870 --> 02:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding I mean it's no
 
02:27:01.330 --> 02:27:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
so shall we reopen it no no no I'm
 
02:27:06.410 --> 02:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
absolutely not asking that the Committee
 
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
hearing be reopened no absolutely not
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
no no problem whatsoever we all make
 
02:27:22.809 --> 02:27:22.819 align:start position:0%
mistakes so that's for sure and I make
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
more than my share I'm sure
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
oh microphone that's great is is it on
 
02:27:38.330 --> 02:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
now oh it is great
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
um it's nice to be here uh again gilpa
 
02:27:42.110 --> 02:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
legal director at the ACLU of New
 
02:27:43.969 --> 02:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I couldn't help but chuckle at
 
02:27:46.130 --> 02:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
that moment because like um any lawyer
 
02:27:47.870 --> 02:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
and judge knows you you go back to the
 
02:27:49.610 --> 02:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
rule book whenever questions are raised
 
02:27:52.030 --> 02:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
which certainly happened
 
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
read the rules
 
02:27:56.030 --> 02:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm Gonna Keep My Testimony very
 
02:27:59.210 --> 02:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
brief we support this legislation
 
02:27:59.220 --> 02:27:59.929 align:start position:0%
brief we support this legislation
um

02:27:59.929 --> 02:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:03.770 --> 02:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh we want to indicate our support you
 
02:28:05.630 --> 02:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
know I do want to note that it is not
 
02:28:08.210 --> 02:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
uncommon for there to be delays
 
02:28:10.370 --> 02:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes even significant delays with
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
respect to when a requester
 
02:28:15.410 --> 02:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
obtains a substantive response so you
 
02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
know a month or two can lapse even then
 
02:28:20.690 --> 02:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
only to obtain a a blanket denial citing
 
02:28:23.270 --> 02:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
an exemption and so there can be delays
 
02:28:25.429 --> 02:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
in this process
 
02:28:27.469 --> 02:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
um but I do want to note that frankly in
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
in my practice
 
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
um I there is a tendency as a litigant
 
02:28:33.770 --> 02:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a replete a repeat player
 
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
in this space that I do tend to get
 
02:28:38.090 --> 02:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
periodic updates not always but I do and
 
02:28:39.650 --> 02:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
I think why I think this bill is a good
 
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
bill and why I support it is that it
 
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
makes sure that everyone gets that
 
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
benefit not just lawyers like me you
 
02:28:48.889 --> 02:28:48.899 align:start position:0%
know who routinely go to court in public
 
02:28:51.469 --> 02:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
records litigation and I think it's a
 
02:28:53.090 --> 02:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
really important service for government
 
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
agencies to provide just to timely
 
02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
communicate what they're what they're
 
02:28:58.250 --> 02:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
thinking what issues may be coming up
 
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
when they're responding to a request if
 
02:29:03.290 --> 02:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
they're going to be delays why they're
 
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
going to be delays how long I think that
 
02:29:06.349 --> 02:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
really is a good thing because I think
 
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
the more communication that happens
 
02:29:09.469 --> 02:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
between government agencies and
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
requesters in fact the less likely there
 
02:29:13.309 --> 02:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
is to be a fight or dispute down the
 
02:29:15.469 --> 02:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
line the more communication that happens
 
02:29:18.290 --> 02:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
the greater there is a chance that
 
02:29:19.969 --> 02:29:19.979 align:start position:0%
disputes can be resolved amicably
 
02:29:23.809 --> 02:29:23.819 align:start position:0%
without litigation so I think this is a
 
02:29:25.969 --> 02:29:25.979 align:start position:0%
a good bill that really Fosters that
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
level of communication and transparency
 
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
it makes sure that it's not just my
 
02:29:31.849 --> 02:29:31.859 align:start position:0%
office that gets that that every every
 
02:29:33.290 --> 02:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
member of the public gets that whether
 
02:29:35.210 --> 02:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
they have a lawyer or not so for those
 
02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
reasons we support this bill I do want
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
to know with respect to the five-day
 
02:29:40.610 --> 02:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
issue that was raised this actually
 
02:29:42.790 --> 02:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the five-day response
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
requirements I just wanted to flag that
 
02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
a municipality or government agency
 
02:29:49.630 --> 02:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
would still have to respond
 
02:29:52.490 --> 02:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
within five days but what this bill does
 
02:29:55.550 --> 02:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
is just make sure thereafter in the
 
02:29:57.050 --> 02:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
event that the documents aren't produced
 
02:29:58.969 --> 02:29:58.979 align:start position:0%
at the five-day mark that they're just
 
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
again regularly regular check-ins with
 
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
the requester about the status of the
 
02:30:06.349 --> 02:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
request so with that I'll conclude my
 
02:30:10.250 --> 02:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
testimony and it's great to see familiar
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
faces and some new ones as well in the
 
02:30:13.849 --> 02:30:13.859 align:start position:0%
committee thank you thank you Mr
 
02:30:15.410 --> 02:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
President I have questions for this
 
02:30:15.420 --> 02:30:17.030 align:start position:0%
President I have questions for this
Witness

02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
02:30:18.889 --> 02:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
 
02:30:18.899 --> 02:30:19.610 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
you

02:30:19.610 --> 02:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:43.490 --> 02:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:45.530 --> 02:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair nature Grace for the
 
02:30:47.389 --> 02:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
municipal Association
 
02:30:49.790 --> 02:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
um so I I do have a handout today with
 
02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh a proposed amendment so I think that
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
the uh the sponsor raises a great
 
02:30:57.110 --> 02:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
question here so under our current
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
system what happens if you make a right
 
02:31:02.210 --> 02:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
to no law request the agency has five
 
02:31:03.950 --> 02:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
days to respond and they either give you
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
the information they deny the request or
 
02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
they provide a written statement saying
 
02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
how long they need to figure out what
 
02:31:14.090 --> 02:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
they're going to do
 
02:31:16.429 --> 02:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
um and the sponsor raises a great
 
02:31:17.929 --> 02:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
question of okay well what happens if
 
02:31:19.250 --> 02:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
they provide you that written statement
 
02:31:21.530 --> 02:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that their estimate of
 
02:31:24.050 --> 02:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
how long they need to figure out what
 
02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to do is wrong
 
02:31:29.330 --> 02:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
um and so I really think we're resolving
 
02:31:32.809 --> 02:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
this issue makes a lot of sense
 
02:31:34.730 --> 02:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:31:36.590 --> 02:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
we would propose a slightly different
 
02:31:38.929 --> 02:31:38.939 align:start position:0%
solution than the sponsor has put in
 
02:31:40.610 --> 02:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
02:31:43.969 --> 02:31:43.979 align:start position:0%
um so under the existing statute and
 
02:31:43.979 --> 02:31:45.230 align:start position:0%
um so under the existing statute and
under

02:31:45.230 --> 02:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:31:47.870 --> 02:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
the bill as proposed as I understand it
 
02:31:49.490 --> 02:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
is essentially the government would
 
02:31:51.410 --> 02:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
respond and say hey we need however long
 
02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
it is so for example you make a request
 
02:31:55.730 --> 02:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
that you want all the emails from your
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
account administrator for the last six
 
02:31:59.090 --> 02:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
months your town comes back you and says
 
02:32:00.170 --> 02:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
hey we think that's going to take 90
 
02:32:00.180 --> 02:32:01.309 align:start position:0%
hey we think that's going to take 90
days

02:32:01.309 --> 02:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:32:03.410 --> 02:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
90 days is coming up they realize they
 
02:32:05.690 --> 02:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
need a little bit more time
 
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and we think that the appropriate
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
response is really that the municipality
 
02:32:12.770 --> 02:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
should and the people responsible for
 
02:32:15.770 --> 02:32:15.780 align:start position:0%
responding that request should look at
 
02:32:17.630 --> 02:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
how long it's realistically going to
 
02:32:21.290 --> 02:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
take and give you that update along with
 
02:32:23.809 --> 02:32:23.819 align:start position:0%
an update of well what have we done so
 
02:32:25.130 --> 02:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
far so you know that they're not just
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
sitting on it they know you know that
 
02:32:28.790 --> 02:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
they're working towards responding to
 
02:32:30.410 --> 02:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
your request
 
02:32:31.969 --> 02:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
um and that would be different than the
 
02:32:36.110 --> 02:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
30-day update and there are two two
 
02:32:39.290 --> 02:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
reasons that I'm proposing this the
 
02:32:41.690 --> 02:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
first is that
 
02:32:43.610 --> 02:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
the purpose the right to know law is to
 
02:32:45.710 --> 02:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
get information to the hands of people
 
02:32:47.450 --> 02:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
who need that information as soon as
 
02:32:50.330 --> 02:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
possible and I think making
 
02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
making the government look at the
 
02:32:56.090 --> 02:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
request and make a realistic Judgment of
 
02:32:58.270 --> 02:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
how long it's going to take makes sense
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
and the second is I'm very afraid having
 
02:33:04.250 --> 02:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
answered many many legal questions about
 
02:33:07.130 --> 02:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
how the law works that somebody's going
 
02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
to look at the 30-day thing and say hey
 
02:33:10.730 --> 02:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
I missed the first deadline I said I
 
02:33:13.010 --> 02:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
needed 90 days I get an extra 30 days
 
02:33:15.290 --> 02:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
when it doesn't actually take them an
 
02:33:19.070 --> 02:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
extra 30 days so I think by
 
02:33:21.650 --> 02:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
realistically leaving the onus on the
 
02:33:23.750 --> 02:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
government to make that estimate
 
02:33:26.210 --> 02:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
and make that estimate accurately with
 
02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
the update makes sense and so that's
 
02:33:33.590 --> 02:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
what my proposed amendment would do and
 
02:33:34.610 --> 02:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly happy to take any
 
02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone has questions for
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
02:33:40.670 --> 02:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
I do I guess I do have one question
 
02:33:44.270 --> 02:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
about uh Mr Grace the the thing I it I
 
02:33:45.770 --> 02:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
mean one significant difference between
 
02:33:45.780 --> 02:33:47.630 align:start position:0%
mean one significant difference between
your

02:33:47.630 --> 02:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
a proposal and the way it's written now
 
02:33:53.290 --> 02:33:53.300 align:start position:0%
is if I'm understanding your proposal
 
02:33:56.570 --> 02:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
constitutes that there's ju if you can't
 
02:33:59.570 --> 02:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
provide the information
 
02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:00.590 align:start position:0%
provide the information
um

02:34:00.590 --> 02:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:02.090 align:start position:0%
um
uh

02:34:02.090 --> 02:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:04.610 --> 02:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
in the time estimated in the initial
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
written statement then there's only one
 
02:34:10.250 --> 02:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
you the municipality only has an
 
02:34:13.490 --> 02:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide one
 
02:34:15.530 --> 02:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
one report saying it's going to take us
 
02:34:18.849 --> 02:34:18.859 align:start position:0%
longer there's no obligation to continue
 
02:34:22.429 --> 02:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
providing updates is there under yours
 
02:34:24.650 --> 02:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
if I miswrote that there should be a
 
02:34:27.290 --> 02:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
continued continual obligation and
 
02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's what we advise
 
02:34:31.130 --> 02:34:31.140 align:start position:0%
um okay so you don't have it in other
 
02:34:33.650 --> 02:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
words you don't have a problem if we if
 
02:34:36.950 --> 02:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
if your proposed language was tweaked a
 
02:34:38.510 --> 02:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
little to say that
 
02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
it you you gotta you gotta if you don't
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
right if you don't meet the what you've
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
said you're gonna do right you have to
 
02:34:46.730 --> 02:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
provide more responses right so when the
 
02:34:48.830 --> 02:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
ACLU makes that request and they get
 
02:34:51.530 --> 02:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
some information and they get the update
 
02:34:53.330 --> 02:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
of here's how long it's going to take if
 
02:34:56.030 --> 02:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
they miss a second estimated deadline
 
02:34:58.790 --> 02:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's totally fine understandably the
 
02:35:01.490 --> 02:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
ACLU and who or whoever else should get
 
02:35:03.950 --> 02:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
an update of here's where we are
 
02:35:07.010 --> 02:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
um and so they know that we the
 
02:35:08.389 --> 02:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
government are working towards
 
02:35:11.510 --> 02:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
accomplishing the request
 
02:35:14.450 --> 02:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
02:35:16.730 --> 02:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tripp thank you Mr
 
02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question
 
02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:20.389 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question
uh

02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:35:23.510 --> 02:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm a little slow sometimes so uh please
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
bear with me uh
 
02:35:29.510 --> 02:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
I believe that when a right to know
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
request is made there's
 
02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:34.130 align:start position:0%
request is made there's
three

02:35:34.130 --> 02:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
suitable responses by the government
 
02:35:38.090 --> 02:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
agency they can make the record
 
02:35:38.100 --> 02:35:39.710 align:start position:0%
agency they can make the record
available

02:35:39.710 --> 02:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:35:42.349 --> 02:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
they can deny the request
 
02:35:42.359 --> 02:35:44.030 align:start position:0%
they can deny the request
or

02:35:44.030 --> 02:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:35:45.889 --> 02:35:45.899 align:start position:0%
give you a statement saying how long
 
02:35:47.809 --> 02:35:47.819 align:start position:0%
they think it'll take for them to
 
02:35:49.010 --> 02:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
fulfill it
 
02:35:49.020 --> 02:35:50.150 align:start position:0%
fulfill it
uh

02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:35:52.190 --> 02:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
I believe that
 
02:35:54.410 --> 02:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:35:54.420 --> 02:35:55.969 align:start position:0%
the the
bill

02:35:55.969 --> 02:35:55.979 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:35:58.849 --> 02:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
makes the assumption that uh if there's
 
02:36:01.730 --> 02:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
the third option is the one selected
 
02:36:03.950 --> 02:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
that eventually
 
02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
the requester will get the information
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh would it be possible should that the
 
02:36:13.370 --> 02:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
government agency
 
02:36:17.090 --> 02:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
you know in the time used to
 
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
you know prepare the
 
02:36:23.090 --> 02:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
response determines that uh the
 
02:36:25.550 --> 02:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
information should be denied
 
02:36:27.770 --> 02:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
is is that a something that could be
 
02:36:31.250 --> 02:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
written in the response
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
so I think that's inherent in the law so
 
02:36:36.170 --> 02:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
here's let me give you a realistic
 
02:36:40.370 --> 02:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
example so if you make a request for the
 
02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
last six months from your town
 
02:36:44.469 --> 02:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
administer's emails
 
02:36:48.050 --> 02:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
while the IT department can probably run
 
02:36:50.450 --> 02:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
and capture all of those emails fairly
 
02:36:50.460 --> 02:36:52.309 align:start position:0%
and capture all of those emails fairly
quickly

02:36:52.309 --> 02:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
02:36:53.929 --> 02:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
someone in the government's going to
 
02:36:55.969 --> 02:36:55.979 align:start position:0%
have to go through those and determine
 
02:36:57.410 --> 02:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
you know if it's a governmental record
 
02:36:58.969 --> 02:36:58.979 align:start position:0%
which is the first question so if your
 
02:37:01.130 --> 02:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
Town Administrator wrote you know me an
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
email and said hey Nate it's your
 
02:37:04.190 --> 02:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
birthday happy birthday that's not a
 
02:37:05.330 --> 02:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
governmental record because it has
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with with the business of
 
02:37:06.479 --> 02:37:08.030 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with with the business of
government

02:37:08.030 --> 02:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:37:09.889 --> 02:37:09.899 align:start position:0%
um so those aren't going to be included
 
02:37:12.050 --> 02:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
they can exclude those there might be
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
information about
 
02:37:15.770 --> 02:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
pending litigation so they might have
 
02:37:18.290 --> 02:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
sent their Town attorney an email and
 
02:37:20.929 --> 02:37:20.939 align:start position:0%
said hey you know
 
02:37:24.110 --> 02:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
the ACLU is suing us and we want to talk
 
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
about settlement here's kind of some
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
numbers and obviously that's not going
 
02:37:30.050 --> 02:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
to be released because that puts them at
 
02:37:32.570 --> 02:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
a disadvantage when when talking about
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
those settlement investing in settlement
 
02:37:38.570 --> 02:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
negotiations so that might be denied but
 
02:37:39.889 --> 02:37:39.899 align:start position:0%
as they go through it if you know if
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's a later email as they're going
 
02:37:43.969 --> 02:37:43.979 align:start position:0%
through like periodically day by day
 
02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
someone is reading through each of these
 
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
emails they might not know that email
 
02:37:49.969 --> 02:37:49.979 align:start position:0%
exists until
 
02:37:54.410 --> 02:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
day 89 of 90 in which case they're going
 
02:37:55.790 --> 02:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
to say you know we're going to redact
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
that email because it has it there's an
 
02:38:00.410 --> 02:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
exemption that applies but they won't
 
02:38:02.929 --> 02:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
necessarily know about that at the
 
02:38:05.630 --> 02:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
75-day Mark when they thought that they
 
02:38:06.590 --> 02:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
were going to have all that information
 
02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:09.050 align:start position:0%
were going to have all that information
ready

02:38:09.050 --> 02:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:10.670 --> 02:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
does that make sense I hope that
 
02:38:14.270 --> 02:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:16.670 --> 02:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
it'll do thank you other questions I
 
02:38:18.290 --> 02:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
thought I saw another question over on
 
02:38:21.650 --> 02:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
the side but I'm a co-sponsor but I may
 
02:38:23.210 --> 02:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
ask a question correct you didn't
 
02:38:27.370 --> 02:38:27.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:29.450 --> 02:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:38:29.460 --> 02:38:30.230 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
um so the example that you gave about
 
02:38:33.950 --> 02:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
you know going through the emails and
 
02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
finding um you know information between
 
02:38:40.969 --> 02:38:40.979 align:start position:0%
the lawyer and one of the parties um
 
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
at the public agency
 
02:38:44.990 --> 02:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
would that be covered by your attorney
 
02:38:47.090 --> 02:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
client privilege
 
02:38:48.889 --> 02:38:48.899 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:38:51.710 --> 02:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
yes okay um
 
02:38:53.570 --> 02:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that I was just thought
 
02:38:56.450 --> 02:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
that would be an easy example to use so
 
02:38:59.330 --> 02:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
other other questions for this Witness
 
02:39:01.610 --> 02:39:01.620 align:start position:0%

02:39:27.650 --> 02:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
representative Ward one in Dover
 
02:39:32.170 --> 02:39:32.180 align:start position:0%
um and I am a co-sponsor on the bill
 
02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
because I I have uh been looking at this
 
02:39:39.410 --> 02:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
situation for quite some time I've been
 
02:39:41.630 --> 02:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
in the house now for 20 years and I was
 
02:39:43.309 --> 02:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
on the Dover City Council for a couple
 
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
years before then so have a fair amount
 
02:39:48.849 --> 02:39:48.859 align:start position:0%
of experience with governmental issues
 
02:39:54.190 --> 02:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
and my concern is that in most cases
 
02:39:58.250 --> 02:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
these requests can be acknowledged very
 
02:39:58.260 --> 02:39:59.230 align:start position:0%
these requests can be acknowledged very
quickly

02:39:59.230 --> 02:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
02:40:02.710 --> 02:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
they can be complied with very quickly
 
02:40:06.830 --> 02:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
but sometimes the request is uh is
 
02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
constructed in such an open-ended
 
02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
fashion that it that it can require uh
 
02:40:17.270 --> 02:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
the the efforts of the legal department
 
02:40:20.750 --> 02:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
of the city of Dover in some cases and
 
02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
I've conferred with our City attorney
 
02:40:26.270 --> 02:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
and some other people who do this kind
 
02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
of thing for the state
 
02:40:32.050 --> 02:40:32.060 align:start position:0%
um and the the bottom line can be it can
 
02:40:36.410 --> 02:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
it was alluded to a moment ago by Mr
 
02:40:39.770 --> 02:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
Gray's uh that sometimes it's a request
 
02:40:42.730 --> 02:40:42.740 align:start position:0%
for a review of correspondence over a
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
long period of time that that just can't
 
02:40:49.130 --> 02:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
be done in a couple of days you can
 
02:40:51.230 --> 02:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
start it perhaps you can give some kind
 
02:40:54.050 --> 02:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
of a partial uh thing but if you want a
 
02:40:56.650 --> 02:40:56.660 align:start position:0%
a review of
 
02:41:00.530 --> 02:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
five years of Correspondence between the
 
02:41:02.929 --> 02:41:02.939 align:start position:0%
City attorney hypothetically or any city
 
02:41:04.750 --> 02:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
of official
 
02:41:09.410 --> 02:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
and uh and a group of other people this
 
02:41:12.770 --> 02:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
can turn into a doctoral dissertation in
 
02:41:14.210 --> 02:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
terms of the amount of work that's
 
02:41:17.090 --> 02:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
required and that that's one of the
 
02:41:18.650 --> 02:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
concerns that I really want to bring to
 
02:41:22.429 --> 02:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
the committee uh the idea that uh that
 
02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:28.010 --> 02:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
the people who are doing this in many
 
02:41:30.590 --> 02:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
cases are the legal department and they
 
02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
can be literally spending virtually all
 
02:41:36.349 --> 02:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
their time
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
now they've got competing requirements
 
02:41:41.349 --> 02:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
of their position
 
02:41:45.130 --> 02:41:45.140 align:start position:0%
for what whatever the town may need
 
02:41:47.929 --> 02:41:47.939 align:start position:0%
and so they're Torn Between the this
 
02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
inexorable machine of the right to no
 
02:41:52.790 --> 02:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
request that says you got to do this
 
02:41:55.730 --> 02:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
within certain number of days or respond
 
02:41:58.849 --> 02:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
to it with a denial and so forth It's it
 
02:42:03.550 --> 02:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
can be a very very difficult request
 
02:42:07.190 --> 02:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
aspect to re to respond to legitimately
 
02:42:11.090 --> 02:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
as I say in most cases the the thing can
 
02:42:15.290 --> 02:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
be acknowledged and responded to
 
02:42:18.190 --> 02:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
quite simply and quite quickly
 
02:42:22.250 --> 02:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
and the the bill does say every
 
02:42:25.610 --> 02:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
reasonable request and to make a
 
02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable effort
 
02:42:30.650 --> 02:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
one of you brought up the question of
 
02:42:34.270 --> 02:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
what does reasonable mean
 
02:42:37.490 --> 02:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
and I I serve on the joint legislative
 
02:42:39.710 --> 02:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
together with your chairman and I've
 
02:42:45.110 --> 02:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
been on the administrative the gel cars
 
02:42:47.090 --> 02:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
it's called for
 
02:42:50.750 --> 02:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
um 16 years I think so the word
 
02:42:53.330 --> 02:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
reasonable appears in the statutes more
 
02:42:56.990 --> 02:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
than once and it's as as the Judge Lynn
 
02:42:59.450 --> 02:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
knows uh that that's the devil in the
 
02:43:02.929 --> 02:43:02.939 align:start position:0%
details what what does reasonably mean
 
02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
um and and trying to make the word more
 
02:43:09.889 --> 02:43:09.899 align:start position:0%
and more precise can be uh really
 
02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
devilish so uh without wanting to
 
02:43:15.349 --> 02:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
prolong my testimony too much longer but
 
02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
the thing is that I urge the committee
 
02:43:20.210 --> 02:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
to look at seriously at that this
 
02:43:24.429 --> 02:43:24.439 align:start position:0%
conundrum of the not simple request
 
02:43:27.530 --> 02:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
especially something for a a long period
 
02:43:29.690 --> 02:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
of time some kind of a review it can't
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
be done in a short period of time any
 
02:43:34.190 --> 02:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
more than you can pop a seed in the
 
02:43:38.030 --> 02:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
ground and pour you know 800 000 gallons
 
02:43:39.710 --> 02:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
of water on it and expect you're going
 
02:43:42.170 --> 02:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
to have the plant next day it can't be
 
02:43:42.180 --> 02:43:43.150 align:start position:0%
to have the plant next day it can't be
done

02:43:43.150 --> 02:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:43:47.690 --> 02:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
so please do uh you know do your
 
02:43:50.750 --> 02:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable best to look at this language
 
02:43:53.809 --> 02:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
and see if if it does not improve the
 
02:43:56.450 --> 02:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
situation in those instances in which
 
02:43:59.570 --> 02:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
the request is not a simple one and
 
02:44:01.910 --> 02:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
therefore can't be responded to a
 
02:44:05.389 --> 02:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
immediately possibly partially but you
 
02:44:06.950 --> 02:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
can't get a full review of something
 
02:44:10.730 --> 02:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
that requires months of work and it's
 
02:44:13.370 --> 02:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive one other aspect I
 
02:44:16.790 --> 02:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
do want to to address here and that is
 
02:44:21.530 --> 02:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
that not every requester is uh is a an
 
02:44:25.130 --> 02:44:25.140 align:start position:0%
ordinary citizen who wants to have some
 
02:44:28.570 --> 02:44:28.580 align:start position:0%
bit of information acknowledged or refer
 
02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
referenced in a short period of time and
 
02:44:32.530 --> 02:44:32.540 align:start position:0%
it can be
 
02:44:36.110 --> 02:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
you do have in some cases malicious
 
02:44:39.950 --> 02:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
actors who do want a hamstring the
 
02:44:43.750 --> 02:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
municipality by requests which can be
 
02:44:47.330 --> 02:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive and they tie up
 
02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
people who need to be do who need to be
 
02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
doing in some cases more important
 
02:44:55.270 --> 02:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
things so the malicious actor is is one
 
02:44:59.809 --> 02:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
that is causing a lot of problems so
 
02:45:01.550 --> 02:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'll answer any questions you might have
 
02:45:03.469 --> 02:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
if you have questions for this witness
 
02:45:06.950 --> 02:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative Staples thank you Mr
 
02:45:10.130 --> 02:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
exceptional circumstances that consume a
 
02:45:18.770 --> 02:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
lot of time and are very costly to the
 
02:45:23.450 --> 02:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
municipality is there any way to assess
 
02:45:27.170 --> 02:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
some type of fee recovery for those sort
 
02:45:30.250 --> 02:45:30.260 align:start position:0%
of things either to discourage or enable
 
02:45:33.889 --> 02:45:33.899 align:start position:0%
the the delivery without such a heavy
 
02:45:36.830 --> 02:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
impact upon the municipality
 
02:45:38.750 --> 02:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
well that is an excellent question
 
02:45:41.929 --> 02:45:41.939 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton and the reality
 
02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
is uh that that's one of the problems is
 
02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
is kind of a kick me sign
 
02:45:51.889 --> 02:45:51.899 align:start position:0%
um uh in some requests in some
 
02:45:55.090 --> 02:45:55.100 align:start position:0%
situations uh that because there is
 
02:45:58.849 --> 02:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
essentially minimal cost involved to
 
02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
make the request uh that it it it tempts
 
02:46:04.969 --> 02:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
the malicious actor
 
02:46:08.090 --> 02:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
um or even the the unfamiliar citizen
 
02:46:10.969 --> 02:46:10.979 align:start position:0%
who doesn't realize that his request is
 
02:46:13.610 --> 02:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
so open-ended that it's going to be very
 
02:46:16.010 --> 02:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
expensive but he ain't going to pay it
 
02:46:19.490 --> 02:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh so it encourages uh you know abuses
 
02:46:22.370 --> 02:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
in my opinion thank you
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
follow up sure so basically the answer
 
02:46:27.889 --> 02:46:27.899 align:start position:0%
is we have no recourse against those
 
02:46:31.250 --> 02:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
malicious actors or the Unknowing
 
02:46:35.210 --> 02:46:35.220 align:start position:0%
uh request that's too extensive to be
 
02:46:38.030 --> 02:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
handled expeditiously
 
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
I I think that's one of the problems
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
that that the committee has to be aware
 
02:46:44.750 --> 02:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
of this and and perhaps some testimony
 
02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
from uh uh a City attorney or there are
 
02:46:52.250 --> 02:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
there are people who in the at the state
 
02:46:55.250 --> 02:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
level who also deal with these requests
 
02:46:58.670 --> 02:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
this type of requests and uh and hearing
 
02:47:00.530 --> 02:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
from them might be beneficial for the
 
02:47:02.330 --> 02:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
Committees I don't know whether it's
 
02:47:04.730 --> 02:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
going to go to a subcommittee but
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
um or whether it's an early bill but but
 
02:47:10.210 --> 02:47:10.220 align:start position:0%
that is an aspect as well very
 
02:47:12.590 --> 02:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
significant question thank you
 
02:47:14.690 --> 02:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
oh thank you other questions for this
 
02:47:14.700 --> 02:47:16.309 align:start position:0%
oh thank you other questions for this

02:47:44.690 --> 02:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
so I can still say good morning
 
02:47:46.490 --> 02:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the Judiciary
 
02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:47.870 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the Judiciary
Committee

02:47:47.870 --> 02:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
02:47:50.270 --> 02:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
um and and your honor my name is
 
02:47:52.190 --> 02:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
Catherine Coco I am the acting president
 
02:47:54.410 --> 02:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
of right to know New Hampshire we are a
 
02:47:56.389 --> 02:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
citizen-based organization that provides
 
02:47:58.550 --> 02:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
advocacy education and assistance to
 
02:47:59.870 --> 02:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
those seeking access to public
 
02:48:02.270 --> 02:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
information and increase transparency in
 
02:48:04.730 --> 02:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
government operations our priorities are
 
02:48:06.889 --> 02:48:06.899 align:start position:0%
threefolds to keep government records
 
02:48:08.929 --> 02:48:08.939 align:start position:0%
access free and open to the public in
 
02:48:10.010 --> 02:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
compliance with the New Hampshire
 
02:48:12.290 --> 02:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
constitution in part one article 8 which
 
02:48:13.910 --> 02:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
stresses and uses the term
 
02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
accountability twice to improve the
 
02:48:18.170 --> 02:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
enforcement of New Hampshire's right to
 
02:48:19.969 --> 02:48:19.979 align:start position:0%
no law and to improve government
 
02:48:22.309 --> 02:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
transparency you'll be hearing from me
 
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
today on a number of proposed bills so I
 
02:48:26.210 --> 02:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
won't repeat my introduction
 
02:48:26.220 --> 02:48:27.230 align:start position:0%
won't repeat my introduction
um

02:48:27.230 --> 02:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
right to know New Hampshire views hb149
 
02:48:31.429 --> 02:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
is an incredibly important piece of
 
02:48:33.889 --> 02:48:33.899 align:start position:0%
legislation this year this is one of two
 
02:48:35.929 --> 02:48:35.939 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation that our members
 
02:48:37.849 --> 02:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
chose to really focus on because it
 
02:48:39.530 --> 02:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
addresses a critical issue that is
 
02:48:41.389 --> 02:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
raised in many of the inquiries that we
 
02:48:43.610 --> 02:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
receive from the public this bill
 
02:48:45.530 --> 02:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
provides clarifying language that makes
 
02:48:47.809 --> 02:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
it clear that a public body has ongoing
 
02:48:49.969 --> 02:48:49.979 align:start position:0%
accountability for every right to know
 
02:48:52.190 --> 02:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
request until such time as a decision is
 
02:48:54.530 --> 02:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
made and the records when available are
 
02:48:54.540 --> 02:48:55.730 align:start position:0%
made and the records when available are
provided

02:48:55.730 --> 02:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
provided
 
02:48:58.130 --> 02:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
currently the only response required
 
02:49:00.170 --> 02:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
under the law is that within five days
 
02:49:02.030 --> 02:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
the public body must do the three things
 
02:49:03.410 --> 02:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
that were one of the three things that
 
02:49:05.590 --> 02:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
were mentioned before provided denial
 
02:49:09.590 --> 02:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
provide a provide the record itself or
 
02:49:11.210 --> 02:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
provide a written statement of the time
 
02:49:13.309 --> 02:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
reasonably necessary to determine if the
 
02:49:15.230 --> 02:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
request should be granted or denied and
 
02:49:16.250 --> 02:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
that reason
 
02:49:18.050 --> 02:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
note that there is actually no
 
02:49:19.969 --> 02:49:19.979 align:start position:0%
requirement to ultimately provide a
 
02:49:21.770 --> 02:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
final determination and the records
 
02:49:24.349 --> 02:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
themselves when the public body selects
 
02:49:25.610 --> 02:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
item three
 
02:49:28.730 --> 02:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we see immediate responses
 
02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
or denials from public bodies far less
 
02:49:32.750 --> 02:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
frequently than we see a standard
 
02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
legalistic response outlining an
 
02:49:36.950 --> 02:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated wait time for records when
 
02:49:38.750 --> 02:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
someone makes a request
 
02:49:41.389 --> 02:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
as a predictable result the most common
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
inquiry that right to know New Hampshire
 
02:49:44.450 --> 02:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
receives from the general public
 
02:49:46.969 --> 02:49:46.979 align:start position:0%
regarding these inquiries is regarding
 
02:49:49.130 --> 02:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
extended time frames in which the
 
02:49:50.510 --> 02:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
requesters have been waiting for
 
02:49:52.730 --> 02:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
information without receiving updates on
 
02:49:54.349 --> 02:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
the status or the completion of their
 
02:49:54.359 --> 02:49:55.370 align:start position:0%
the status or the completion of their
request

02:49:55.370 --> 02:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:49:57.889 --> 02:49:57.899 align:start position:0%
based on the current language of the
 
02:49:57.899 --> 02:49:58.849 align:start position:0%
based on the current language of the
statute

02:49:58.849 --> 02:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:50:00.650 --> 02:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
the only advice that right to know New
 
02:50:01.730 --> 02:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can provide to those
 
02:50:03.770 --> 02:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
individuals is that the public body is
 
02:50:05.809 --> 02:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
only required to provide them with an
 
02:50:08.450 --> 02:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
anticipated time frame for response it
 
02:50:09.950 --> 02:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
does not actually provide for any
 
02:50:11.450 --> 02:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
further update on the status of the
 
02:50:13.190 --> 02:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
request the efforts being made to
 
02:50:15.349 --> 02:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
respond or actual completion of the
 
02:50:17.570 --> 02:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
request this loophole does not serve the
 
02:50:19.250 --> 02:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
public interest and weighs the balance
 
02:50:21.170 --> 02:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
of power in favor of the public body who
 
02:50:22.849 --> 02:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
may have reasons of its own to wish to
 
02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
delay or withhold information
 
02:50:27.170 --> 02:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
various Court decisions have made it
 
02:50:28.730 --> 02:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
clear though what constitutes an
 
02:50:30.469 --> 02:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
acceptable time frame for consideration
 
02:50:32.929 --> 02:50:32.939 align:start position:0%
or fulfillment of requests can depend on
 
02:50:34.730 --> 02:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
the size and the scope of that request
 
02:50:37.190 --> 02:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that speaks to some of what
 
02:50:39.230 --> 02:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton's question was
 
02:50:40.849 --> 02:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
I can speak to that a little bit later
 
02:50:41.929 --> 02:50:41.939 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:50:44.570 --> 02:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
this revision doesn't change that fact
 
02:50:47.630 --> 02:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
and the language that is written here is
 
02:50:49.670 --> 02:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
not designed to be punitive despite the
 
02:50:51.530 --> 02:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
fact that public bodies do not really
 
02:50:53.270 --> 02:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
have a motivating disincentive to
 
02:50:57.170 --> 02:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
delaying their response instead hb149
 
02:50:59.809 --> 02:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
could provide the future right to know
 
02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman which we are very excited
 
02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
about and the courts with relevant
 
02:51:05.809 --> 02:51:05.819 align:start position:0%
information about the public body's good
 
02:51:07.610 --> 02:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
faith efforts to honor the request and
 
02:51:10.309 --> 02:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
adhere to the intent of 91a
 
02:51:11.809 --> 02:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
and I think in response to
 
02:51:14.330 --> 02:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander's question we
 
02:51:16.250 --> 02:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the information provided
 
02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
in these updates will allow for a more
 
02:51:19.969 --> 02:51:19.979 align:start position:0%
objective evaluation of the public
 
02:51:21.469 --> 02:51:21.479 align:start position:0%
body's efforts when those are in
 
02:51:23.150 --> 02:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
question at the court or through the
 
02:51:23.160 --> 02:51:24.830 align:start position:0%
question at the court or through the
ombudsman

02:51:24.830 --> 02:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
ombudsman
 
02:51:26.630 --> 02:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
we would also argue that once the
 
02:51:28.370 --> 02:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
request is made the burden of justifying
 
02:51:29.870 --> 02:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
a lack of response should fall in the
 
02:51:31.550 --> 02:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
public body it is asking for an
 
02:51:33.469 --> 02:51:33.479 align:start position:0%
exception and the public body should be
 
02:51:35.090 --> 02:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
accountable for actions it has or has
 
02:51:37.370 --> 02:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
not taken and this this language
 
02:51:39.050 --> 02:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
achieves that without creating a
 
02:51:41.690 --> 02:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
punitive disincentive we also think the
 
02:51:43.370 --> 02:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
30-day window is a reasonable period of
 
02:51:45.590 --> 02:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
time would not place an undue burden on
 
02:51:47.570 --> 02:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
the public body and it aligns the
 
02:51:49.849 --> 02:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
expectations of both parties involved in
 
02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
the request process and hopefully
 
02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of the current demands on
 
02:51:56.090 --> 02:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
the public body that are that exist
 
02:51:57.650 --> 02:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
because there's already a lack of
 
02:51:59.330 --> 02:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
guidance regarding follow-up so
 
02:52:01.610 --> 02:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
individuals will be following up the
 
02:52:03.230 --> 02:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
community or public body doesn't know
 
02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
what their requirement is to respond
 
02:52:06.410 --> 02:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of back and forth if you
 
02:52:08.210 --> 02:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
have an established process for this it
 
02:52:10.190 --> 02:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
should help clear some of that up
 
02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
our hope is that adding these simple
 
02:52:13.849 --> 02:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements will assist
 
02:52:16.370 --> 02:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
citizens public bodies and the courts in
 
02:52:17.929 --> 02:52:17.939 align:start position:0%
establishing whether or not reasonable
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
efforts have been made to address those
 
02:52:22.010 --> 02:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
requests and I'd like to add a couple of
 
02:52:24.050 --> 02:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
things to my prepared testimony and I
 
02:52:25.730 --> 02:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
will send a copy of this to your staff
 
02:52:28.309 --> 02:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
person I did not come with copies um but
 
02:52:31.130 --> 02:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
I know how to submit them electronically
 
02:52:33.230 --> 02:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
um to answer a few questions that have
 
02:52:36.650 --> 02:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
come up I have had a couple of
 
02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
situations where I personally have put
 
02:52:40.429 --> 02:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
in a request and that request has been
 
02:52:41.809 --> 02:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
I've been given the time frame for
 
02:52:44.690 --> 02:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
response and at the end of that time
 
02:52:46.610 --> 02:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
frame from response I have been told
 
02:52:49.010 --> 02:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
that certain elements of my requests
 
02:52:51.170 --> 02:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
were were being denied at that point so
 
02:52:53.030 --> 02:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes that does happen
 
02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:54.230 align:start position:0%
yes that does happen
um

02:52:54.230 --> 02:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:56.389 --> 02:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
I think that we need further
 
02:52:58.550 --> 02:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
clarification on the amendment I didn't
 
02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
quite follow quite honestly the
 
02:53:03.530 --> 02:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
significance of the change that nhma was
 
02:53:05.809 --> 02:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
requesting it seems to me that what
 
02:53:07.370 --> 02:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
we're asking for
 
02:53:12.050 --> 02:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
um in in this particular bill is uh
 
02:53:12.060 --> 02:53:13.610 align:start position:0%
um in in this particular bill is uh
already

02:53:13.610 --> 02:53:13.620 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:53:16.250 --> 02:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
what what nhma is saying that they want
 
02:53:17.690 --> 02:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
except that there wouldn't be any
 
02:53:19.250 --> 02:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
additional follow-up after the second
 
02:53:21.290 --> 02:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
update and I think that leaves a pretty
 
02:53:23.389 --> 02:53:23.399 align:start position:0%
wide loophole but I need to make sure
 
02:53:25.070 --> 02:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm reading that correctly so I'll
 
02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that in writing as well
 
02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:28.490 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that in writing as well
um

02:53:28.490 --> 02:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:31.490 --> 02:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
and finally I would add for um
 
02:53:34.330 --> 02:53:34.340 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton's question
 
02:53:37.490 --> 02:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
that language that was mentioned by rep
 
02:53:40.190 --> 02:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative Smith is that correct I'm
 
02:53:44.389 --> 02:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
sorry not Smith um Schmidt great okay
 
02:53:46.969 --> 02:53:46.979 align:start position:0%
um the courts have determined that there
 
02:53:49.790 --> 02:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
is a um what the boundaries of
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable are some that case laws and
 
02:53:54.110 --> 02:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
that information is already out there
 
02:53:58.250 --> 02:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
and so there is some leeway for a public
 
02:54:00.410 --> 02:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
body to determine whether or not a
 
02:54:02.570 --> 02:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
request is reasonable or unreasonable if
 
02:54:04.370 --> 02:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
not in the statute but based on the case
 
02:54:07.250 --> 02:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
law and so that provides the basis for
 
02:54:09.769 --> 02:54:09.779 align:start position:0%
responding to the kinds of overburden
 
02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
some concerns that that you've raised
 
02:54:16.610 --> 02:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
and with that I will question welcome
 
02:54:18.710 --> 02:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
your questions
 
02:54:21.290 --> 02:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
being none thank you very much oh well
 
02:54:22.670 --> 02:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry
 
02:54:24.349 --> 02:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo thank you Mr
 
02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:54:28.969 --> 02:54:28.979 align:start position:0%
question Miss Coco so you know just to
 
02:54:30.889 --> 02:54:30.899 align:start position:0%
follow up on what you had just said that
 
02:54:33.290 --> 02:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
there's sort of a Judicial remedy for
 
02:54:36.889 --> 02:54:36.899 align:start position:0%
you know abusers of um you know right to
 
02:54:39.290 --> 02:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
know requests yep um how does it get to
 
02:54:42.290 --> 02:54:42.300 align:start position:0%
the point of um a judge how does it get
 
02:54:42.300 --> 02:54:43.370 align:start position:0%
the point of um a judge how does it get
there

02:54:43.370 --> 02:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:54:45.469 --> 02:54:45.479 align:start position:0%
so at this point because the Ombudsman
 
02:54:47.750 --> 02:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
does not take office until January 27th
 
02:54:51.110 --> 02:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
an individual would have to file
 
02:54:53.690 --> 02:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
something with the court in order to
 
02:54:56.030 --> 02:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
to have an action come forward
 
02:54:57.950 --> 02:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:55:00.830 --> 02:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
answer your question or
 
02:55:02.809 --> 02:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
I need to think about her a little more
 
02:55:04.969 --> 02:55:04.979 align:start position:0%
it would need to be
 
02:55:07.309 --> 02:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
so I I believe if the public body feels
 
02:55:08.870 --> 02:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
that it's being overburdened it would be
 
02:55:10.429 --> 02:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
their responsibility to file something
 
02:55:12.650 --> 02:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
or it's through usually I mean I would
 
02:55:14.389 --> 02:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
say Town Council or their own Council
 
02:55:15.590 --> 02:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
but I mean
 
02:55:17.630 --> 02:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately until the Ombudsman is up
 
02:55:19.969 --> 02:55:19.979 align:start position:0%
and running that is that is the reality
 
02:55:22.250 --> 02:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
Where We Are
 
02:55:26.210 --> 02:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
close to follow up I I think that um
 
02:55:28.250 --> 02:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
public officials
 
02:55:28.260 --> 02:55:29.210 align:start position:0%
public officials
um

02:55:29.210 --> 02:55:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:32.570 --> 02:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
kind of back away from
 
02:55:34.790 --> 02:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
um I feel that they should
 
02:55:38.590 --> 02:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
back away from you know getting into
 
02:55:41.809 --> 02:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
contentious you know fights with the
 
02:55:43.610 --> 02:55:43.620 align:start position:0%
public so I think that's that's
 
02:55:43.620 --> 02:55:45.590 align:start position:0%
public so I think that's that's
um

02:55:45.590 --> 02:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:47.929 --> 02:55:47.939 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like walking on eggs
 
02:55:50.570 --> 02:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
you know because I mean public agencies
 
02:55:53.090 --> 02:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
are there to serve the public
 
02:55:55.610 --> 02:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you understood all right any other
 
02:55:59.269 --> 02:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh Carla
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh Rocky is that correct Jericho sorry
 
02:56:07.610 --> 02:56:07.620 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:56:10.010 --> 02:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
hello committee my name is Carla Garrick
 
02:56:11.750 --> 02:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm from Manchester New Hampshire I'm
 
02:56:13.849 --> 02:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
here representing both myself because I
 
02:56:16.130 --> 02:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
do file a lot of right to no requests
 
02:56:18.170 --> 02:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
and I also serve on the board of right
 
02:56:20.690 --> 02:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
to know New Hampshire right to know New
 
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a Statewide nonpartisan
 
02:56:25.610 --> 02:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
group of concerned Citizens We're just
 
02:56:27.710 --> 02:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
people who really care about the issue
 
02:56:29.690 --> 02:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
of as it's stated in the New Hampshire
 
02:56:33.469 --> 02:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
Constitution open transparent accessible
 
02:56:37.010 --> 02:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
and accountable government I think I'm
 
02:56:38.870 --> 02:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
here in support of this bill and it's
 
02:56:40.790 --> 02:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
kind of nice to be on the same side with
 
02:56:42.530 --> 02:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
people I'm sometimes on the other side
 
02:56:45.290 --> 02:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
of so uh that probably tells all of us
 
02:56:47.929 --> 02:56:47.939 align:start position:0%
this is a good Bull good for the people
 
02:56:50.030 --> 02:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:56:52.309 --> 02:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
you know I think the important takeaways
 
02:56:54.830 --> 02:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
here to remember is the way the bill
 
02:56:57.590 --> 02:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
right to know is currently written they
 
02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
the public agency would have to respond
 
02:57:04.010 --> 02:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
within those five days this is really
 
02:57:07.190 --> 02:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
just providing a broader exception in
 
02:57:09.889 --> 02:57:09.899 align:start position:0%
those cases where they don't respond
 
02:57:12.889 --> 02:57:12.899 align:start position:0%
within those five days in my experience
 
02:57:15.530 --> 02:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
it's actually really good if the public
 
02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
body just you know gives the information
 
02:57:20.510 --> 02:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
but there are situations where there's a
 
02:57:22.910 --> 02:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
big request and we understand that
 
02:57:26.330 --> 02:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
people do need a little more time I
 
02:57:28.429 --> 02:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a point to representative
 
02:57:30.769 --> 02:57:30.779 align:start position:0%
greeson's point I think it might be
 
02:57:34.130 --> 02:57:34.140 align:start position:0%
valuable to add in to the end of this
 
02:57:37.309 --> 02:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
that 90-day period so that we're looking
 
02:57:39.469 --> 02:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
at you know the law says you've got five
 
02:57:41.870 --> 02:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
days or you have to deny it now we're
 
02:57:43.670 --> 02:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
saying well sometimes it seems
 
02:57:45.230 --> 02:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable that you might need some
 
02:57:48.230 --> 02:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
extra time here's 30 extra days but you
 
02:57:50.809 --> 02:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
have to tell us when you think you're
 
02:57:53.030 --> 02:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
going to get to this and you know what
 
02:57:55.190 --> 02:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
you're struggling with but then let's
 
02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
not make it this sort of open-ended
 
02:58:00.110 --> 02:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
thing I can give you a very concrete
 
02:58:00.120 --> 02:58:01.429 align:start position:0%
thing I can give you a very concrete
example

02:58:01.429 --> 02:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:58:03.530 --> 02:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
um recently in Manchester there was a
 
02:58:07.010 --> 02:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
move to rip out a community garden and
 
02:58:09.710 --> 02:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
put in a Boys and Girls Club it was done
 
02:58:11.870 --> 02:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
in a back room deal there was a sale of
 
02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
a public park without any input from
 
02:58:17.269 --> 02:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
anyone in the neighborhood I filed
 
02:58:19.790 --> 02:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
several right to no requests I was I
 
02:58:22.130 --> 02:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
mean I think everyone knows me by now so
 
02:58:24.110 --> 02:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
I got a lot of the requests back very
 
02:58:26.690 --> 02:58:26.700 align:start position:0%
quickly but then with regard to the
 
02:58:30.650 --> 02:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
emails I got the the they said hey it's
 
02:58:32.630 --> 02:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
going to take us about 30 days to get
 
02:58:35.630 --> 02:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
those emails back and then since then I
 
02:58:37.849 --> 02:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
never heard anything back on those
 
02:58:40.730 --> 02:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
emails so this would be a concrete way
 
02:58:43.910 --> 02:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
to really help concerned citizens to be
 
02:58:46.630 --> 02:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
able to hold our government accountable
 
02:58:49.370 --> 02:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
to the point about costs I don't think
 
02:58:51.950 --> 02:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's relevant into this bill at all
 
02:58:53.630 --> 02:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
there are other bills that will be
 
02:58:55.969 --> 02:58:55.979 align:start position:0%
coming in front of this committee and
 
02:58:57.290 --> 02:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
that is something we should talk about
 
02:59:00.650 --> 02:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
but also just as a last point a lot of
 
02:59:02.269 --> 02:59:02.279 align:start position:0%
people who are filing these right to
 
02:59:05.150 --> 02:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
know requests there isn't a malicious
 
02:59:08.630 --> 02:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
intent what there is is an intent of
 
02:59:10.849 --> 02:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
concerned citizens to hold our
 
02:59:13.610 --> 02:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
government accountable the only way we
 
02:59:16.309 --> 02:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
can hold government accountable is if we
 
02:59:20.510 --> 02:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
know what is being done in our names and
 
02:59:22.250 --> 02:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
so that is the goal and I asked the
 
02:59:24.590 --> 02:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
committee to please consider this bill
 
02:59:26.630 --> 02:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
favorably I'm happy to take any
 
02:59:29.809 --> 02:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this Witness
 
02:59:31.790 --> 02:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
 
02:59:34.790 --> 02:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who wishes to
 
02:59:39.410 --> 02:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
testify on HB 149 FM
 
02:59:41.330 --> 02:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
02:59:44.389 --> 02:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill I will note that we
 
02:59:46.910 --> 02:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
are probably about an hour behind
 
02:59:48.769 --> 02:59:48.779 align:start position:0%
schedule what I would propose and I'm
 
02:59:51.230 --> 02:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
open to if committee members have a
 
02:59:53.690 --> 02:59:53.700 align:start position:0%
different view I'm open to consider it I
 
02:59:55.550 --> 02:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
would propose that we hold the hearing
 
02:59:58.730 --> 02:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
uh now on 254.
 
03:00:01.429 --> 03:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh try to get through that and then I
 
03:00:05.030 --> 03:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
would propose that I open uh maybe
 
03:00:07.330 --> 03:00:07.340 align:start position:0%
before 254 that I opened the hearing on
 
03:00:10.429 --> 03:00:10.439 align:start position:0%
289 but recess it until one o'clock does
 
03:00:12.550 --> 03:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
that seem reasonable to everybody
 
03:00:15.050 --> 03:00:15.060 align:start position:0%
seem reasonable all right so what I will
 
03:00:18.230 --> 03:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
do is I will open the hearing on HB 289
 
03:00:21.950 --> 03:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
and then recess it until one o'clock so
 
03:00:23.870 --> 03:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
that people that are here for that and
 
03:00:25.309 --> 03:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
you know if you want to go get lunch you
 
03:00:28.429 --> 03:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
can go do that but then I will
 
03:00:35.990 --> 03:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:41.230 --> 03:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:43.370 --> 03:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:00:45.530 --> 03:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
don't see a pink card for representative
 
03:00:45.540 --> 03:00:47.750 align:start position:0%
don't see a pink card for representative

uh well not quite morning but that's
 
03:01:45.170 --> 03:01:45.180 align:start position:0%

03:01:49.309 --> 03:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:53.150 --> 03:01:53.160 align:start position:0%

03:01:56.090 --> 03:01:56.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and members of the Judiciary
 
03:01:57.769 --> 03:01:57.779 align:start position:0%
Committee thank you for allowing me to
 
03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 254 which would allow local
 
03:02:02.990 --> 03:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
public bodies to meet the needs of their
 
03:02:05.330 --> 03:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
constituencies more effectively by
 
03:02:06.769 --> 03:02:06.779 align:start position:0%
allowing more of their members to access
 
03:02:08.750 --> 03:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
meetings remotely
 
03:02:11.210 --> 03:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
many local public bodies began employing
 
03:02:13.190 --> 03:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
remote meeting technology during the
 
03:02:15.230 --> 03:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic and community members and
 
03:02:16.610 --> 03:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
elected officials found that it was
 
03:02:18.950 --> 03:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
effective and efficient technology that
 
03:02:20.929 --> 03:02:20.939 align:start position:0%
could address issues they face in terms
 
03:02:22.790 --> 03:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
of every everyday participation in
 
03:02:24.349 --> 03:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
running the government
 
03:02:26.510 --> 03:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
Town leaders from across the state have
 
03:02:29.090 --> 03:02:29.100 align:start position:0%
asked that we add language to 91a to
 
03:02:30.650 --> 03:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
make it easier for them to do their work
 
03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
when members face child care or Elder
 
03:02:35.809 --> 03:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
Care emergencies illness or disability
 
03:02:38.809 --> 03:02:38.819 align:start position:0%
issues many local Municipal boards and
 
03:02:40.550 --> 03:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
committees are struggling to achieve a
 
03:02:42.830 --> 03:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
quorum in person that they would easily
 
03:02:44.809 --> 03:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
be able to achieve with an adjustment to
 
03:02:47.809 --> 03:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
91a these select board members zoning
 
03:02:50.269 --> 03:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
board members Etc have time sensitive
 
03:02:52.250 --> 03:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
decisions to make and if they don't make
 
03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
a quorum there are real consequences
 
03:02:55.790 --> 03:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
when they're unable to take a vote at a
 
03:02:55.800 --> 03:02:57.170 align:start position:0%
when they're unable to take a vote at a
meeting

03:02:57.170 --> 03:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
03:02:59.630 --> 03:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
in this bill a physical location for
 
03:03:02.330 --> 03:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
meetings is required but if a quorum is
 
03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
not achieved at the physical location
 
03:03:06.170 --> 03:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
having one-third of the local public
 
03:03:07.969 --> 03:03:07.979 align:start position:0%
body present at the physical location
 
03:03:10.610 --> 03:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
would suffice the Quorum could then be
 
03:03:13.550 --> 03:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
met by members participating remotely
 
03:03:15.889 --> 03:03:15.899 align:start position:0%
this bill focuses specifically on local
 
03:03:21.790 --> 03:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
public bodies as specified in 3A
 
03:03:24.830 --> 03:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
so things like school boards and towns
 
03:03:27.889 --> 03:03:27.899 align:start position:0%
municipalities counties in every case
 
03:03:29.929 --> 03:03:29.939 align:start position:0%
for these rules to be applied the
 
03:03:31.910 --> 03:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
governing body of each local public body
 
03:03:34.969 --> 03:03:34.979 align:start position:0%
can choose to allow this option
 
03:03:36.889 --> 03:03:36.899 align:start position:0%
access to remote state and local
 
03:03:38.510 --> 03:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
meetings during the pandemic was
 
03:03:40.370 --> 03:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
necessary for granted Staters to stay
 
03:03:42.650 --> 03:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
safe but it continues to be necessary
 
03:03:44.750 --> 03:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
for those who experience barriers to
 
03:03:46.969 --> 03:03:46.979 align:start position:0%
accessing in-person meetings under
 
03:03:49.730 --> 03:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
regular non-pandemic conditions those
 
03:03:52.309 --> 03:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
who have disabilities or illness those
 
03:03:54.650 --> 03:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
who have young children who are taking
 
03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
care of Elders those who are
 
03:03:59.630 --> 03:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
have all shared with me how important
 
03:04:02.090 --> 03:04:02.100 align:start position:0%
remote access is to them
 
03:04:04.550 --> 03:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me as members of public bodies
 
03:04:07.130 --> 03:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
this bill gives each local public body
 
03:04:09.530 --> 03:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
the ability to be flexible for its needs
 
03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
while still adhering to the right to
 
03:04:13.190 --> 03:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
know laws
 
03:04:15.469 --> 03:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
so before I take your questions I need
 
03:04:18.170 --> 03:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
to ask you to consider an amendment so
 
03:04:20.030 --> 03:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
it has come to my attention and I
 
03:04:23.269 --> 03:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
apologize that it at such a late date
 
03:04:24.349 --> 03:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
um but I've been speaking with
 
03:04:26.870 --> 03:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
disability rights Advocates and by
 
03:04:29.690 --> 03:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
making 254 a repeal and replace Bill
 
03:04:32.690 --> 03:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
we've inadvertently taken away options
 
03:04:34.610 --> 03:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
for committees who are already meeting
 
03:04:37.370 --> 03:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
under paragraph three
 
03:04:41.870 --> 03:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
um RSA 91a to paragraph 3 to operate as
 
03:04:43.849 --> 03:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
they are now operating so committees
 
03:04:46.790 --> 03:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps of the Department of Education
 
03:04:49.670 --> 03:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
or something like that so there are
 
03:04:51.889 --> 03:04:51.899 align:start position:0%
already rules for those in place so what
 
03:04:53.750 --> 03:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask you to do is consider
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
this amendment that leaves paragraph 3
 
03:04:59.210 --> 03:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
untouched but would add this as a new
 
03:05:05.330 --> 03:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
paragraph under that three a three a a
 
03:05:08.389 --> 03:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
through H I believe so
 
03:05:11.090 --> 03:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
um oh can I one more sentence I'm almost
 
03:05:13.250 --> 03:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:05:15.230 --> 03:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
um so I would add this new paragraph
 
03:05:17.330 --> 03:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
that would only apply to local public
 
03:05:19.610 --> 03:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
bodies and it would um Define it for
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
that case
 
03:05:22.849 --> 03:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
03:05:25.790 --> 03:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's also come to our attention that we
 
03:05:28.670 --> 03:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh in the drafting of the amendment we
 
03:05:30.530 --> 03:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
need to add an exception for town
 
03:05:32.090 --> 03:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
meeting because we think that would be
 
03:05:34.790 --> 03:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
really impractical
 
03:05:39.050 --> 03:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
um so that will hopefully I have spoken
 
03:05:41.330 --> 03:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
to a member of your committee who may uh
 
03:05:43.309 --> 03:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
change this amendment and bring it to
 
03:05:46.070 --> 03:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
you as well but I'll answer my question
 
03:05:48.349 --> 03:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
your questions the best of my ability
 
03:05:50.330 --> 03:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
um but also there are others here who
 
03:05:51.950 --> 03:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
will be speaking who may be able to
 
03:05:53.269 --> 03:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
answer them too
 
03:05:54.710 --> 03:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
um let me pass this around if that's
 
03:06:08.929 --> 03:06:08.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:10.250 --> 03:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:06:10.260 --> 03:06:12.769 align:start position:0%
all right
um

03:06:12.769 --> 03:06:12.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:12.779 --> 03:06:14.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:06:14.030 --> 03:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:17.510 --> 03:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
do we have questions for this Witness
 
03:06:22.849 --> 03:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:24.950 --> 03:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:06:26.990 --> 03:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question I only have one
 
03:06:28.849 --> 03:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
question sure is this bill
 
03:06:31.130 --> 03:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
constitutional is this bill
 
03:06:34.130 --> 03:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
constitutional we believe that it is yes
 
03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
we have no reason to believe that it's
 
03:06:37.849 --> 03:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
not we believe that it's in line with
 
03:06:41.809 --> 03:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
what is already in RSA 91a
 
03:06:47.450 --> 03:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:49.610 --> 03:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
and and you know what I just I guess I
 
03:06:51.290 --> 03:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
just have a question so you are going to
 
03:06:53.090 --> 03:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
provide or maybe you already have this
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
is this is the amendment this is the
 
03:06:57.469 --> 03:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
cure that yes problems you identified
 
03:06:59.690 --> 03:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
okay yes that's it that's that takes
 
03:07:01.610 --> 03:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
care of my question so uh the only thing
 
03:07:03.349 --> 03:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do to that is add an
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
exception for Town meetings right after
 
03:07:08.210 --> 03:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
local public body in the first paragraph
 
03:07:10.910 --> 03:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
it will say accept town meeting
 
03:07:14.570 --> 03:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
other than that it's soft it solves the
 
03:07:14.580 --> 03:07:19.670 align:start position:0%
other than that it's soft it solves the
oversight

03:07:19.670 --> 03:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just making a note
 
03:07:24.769 --> 03:07:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:24.779 --> 03:07:25.969 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:07:25.969 --> 03:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:07:28.429 --> 03:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
um all right other questions for the yes
 
03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Perez might I have you
 
03:07:33.769 --> 03:07:33.779 align:start position:0%
add and school
 
03:07:36.530 --> 03:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
meetings too because we have a separate
 
03:07:39.610 --> 03:07:39.620 align:start position:0%
Town meetings and separate school
 
03:07:42.170 --> 03:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
meetings when you're voting on people
 
03:07:45.710 --> 03:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
and budget so perhaps that should be an
 
03:07:47.269 --> 03:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
exception too
 
03:07:49.370 --> 03:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
let's definitely talk about that I
 
03:07:50.990 --> 03:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
haven't thought about that or talked to
 
03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:52.130 align:start position:0%
haven't thought about that or talked to
anybody

03:07:52.130 --> 03:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
03:07:54.769 --> 03:07:54.779 align:start position:0%
um who does that at this point but let
 
03:07:56.690 --> 03:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
yeah we can definitely talk about that
 
03:07:59.150 --> 03:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
may I yes when you're talking about town
 
03:08:01.610 --> 03:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
meeting are you talking about
 
03:08:04.370 --> 03:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
you know I live in Londonderry we have a
 
03:08:06.590 --> 03:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
town meeting well it's not really a town
 
03:08:08.809 --> 03:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
it would be inappropriate to have people
 
03:08:10.969 --> 03:08:10.979 align:start position:0%
in by
 
03:08:13.429 --> 03:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
um Zoom or whatever
 
03:08:16.250 --> 03:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
so I we were thinking of the
 
03:08:18.830 --> 03:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
of the Town meetings where folks don't
 
03:08:20.750 --> 03:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
vote in the voting booth where they vote
 
03:08:22.010 --> 03:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
in a room
 
03:08:24.170 --> 03:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
so I've not thought about deliberative
 
03:08:26.330 --> 03:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
session yeah no my town also has a
 
03:08:27.710 --> 03:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
deliberative session I've not thought
 
03:08:30.170 --> 03:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
about deliberative session
 
03:08:32.750 --> 03:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I'd have to talk to especially to the
 
03:08:34.370 --> 03:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
municipal Association who's representing
 
03:08:36.469 --> 03:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
the towns and municipalities to see what
 
03:08:38.450 --> 03:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
kinds of conversations the folks who run
 
03:08:38.460 --> 03:08:39.349 align:start position:0%
kinds of conversations the folks who run
those

03:08:39.349 --> 03:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:08:41.690 --> 03:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
um and who participate in those have had
 
03:08:41.700 --> 03:08:43.130 align:start position:0%
um and who participate in those have had
already

03:08:43.130 --> 03:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:08:45.170 --> 03:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
um the the other piece of this is that
 
03:08:47.269 --> 03:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
there's already in statute there's
 
03:08:50.469 --> 03:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
already Provisions for
 
03:08:53.690 --> 03:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
meetings that allow for remote access of
 
03:08:55.610 --> 03:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
the public body
 
03:08:58.190 --> 03:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
um and so the amendment wouldn't change
 
03:09:01.309 --> 03:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
that it would just change the um Quorum
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
so right now you'd still you still have
 
03:09:07.429 --> 03:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
to have a quorum like for a deliberative
 
03:09:11.330 --> 03:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:12.830 --> 03:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
um in the pre in the physical location
 
03:09:12.840 --> 03:09:14.809 align:start position:0%
um in the pre in the physical location
right

03:09:14.809 --> 03:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:09:18.889 --> 03:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
um and so this amendment without an
 
03:09:20.690 --> 03:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
exception for deliberative session would
 
03:09:23.750 --> 03:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
say that you'd ha you could have a third
 
03:09:27.469 --> 03:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
present as opposed to 50 percent
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
um plus one uh
 
03:09:33.769 --> 03:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:36.050 --> 03:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you question representative Tripp
 
03:09:38.750 --> 03:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
actually I have a question on the chair
 
03:09:40.910 --> 03:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
since uh we're holding a hearing
 
03:09:44.950 --> 03:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
obviously we've accepted the bill uh
 
03:09:48.050 --> 03:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
will the uh the prime sponsor be able to
 
03:09:53.030 --> 03:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:55.429 --> 03:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
I think we well we've we've got it right
 
03:09:59.510 --> 03:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
I mean we've we I I I I
 
03:10:08.450 --> 03:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:08.460 --> 03:10:09.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:10:09.469 --> 03:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
during the amendment in uh but I believe
 
03:10:15.290 --> 03:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson understands that
 
03:10:19.490 --> 03:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
yeah yes I do and um and have talked to
 
03:10:21.769 --> 03:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
um representative page has offered to
 
03:10:23.870 --> 03:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
work with me um to turn it into
 
03:10:25.370 --> 03:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
amendment that you all could have at
 
03:10:26.809 --> 03:10:26.819 align:start position:0%
your executive session if that's all
 
03:10:28.730 --> 03:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
I'll write with you it makes that makes
 
03:10:31.070 --> 03:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
perfect sense okay other questions
 
03:10:35.269 --> 03:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
for this way yes uh representative puta
 
03:10:37.010 --> 03:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
so as
 
03:10:39.769 --> 03:10:39.779 align:start position:0%
as this was originally written it had
 
03:10:43.250 --> 03:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
allowed for a public body may but is not
 
03:10:46.429 --> 03:10:46.439 align:start position:0%
required to yes and this is changing it
 
03:10:50.870 --> 03:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
to a local public body and then it's
 
03:10:50.880 --> 03:10:52.250 align:start position:0%
to a local public body and then it's
also

03:10:52.250 --> 03:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:10:52.260 --> 03:10:53.050 align:start position:0%
also
um

03:10:53.050 --> 03:10:53.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:56.090 --> 03:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
excluding the fact that it can't apply
 
03:10:57.830 --> 03:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
to the general court was that
 
03:10:57.840 --> 03:11:01.370 align:start position:0%
to the general court was that
intentional

03:11:01.370 --> 03:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:03.349 --> 03:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
um that's a great question the general
 
03:11:05.990 --> 03:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
court makes its own rules so we have
 
03:11:08.090 --> 03:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
only been focused on the local public
 
03:11:11.210 --> 03:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
bodies for this piece of legislation so
 
03:11:14.809 --> 03:11:14.819 align:start position:0%
if you look in the definitions for RFA
 
03:11:18.830 --> 03:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh 91a number five is for public body
 
03:11:20.389 --> 03:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
and then it has a list of different
 
03:11:24.590 --> 03:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
kinds of public bodies and Part D is the
 
03:11:24.600 --> 03:11:25.190 align:start position:0%
kinds of public bodies and Part D is the
um

03:11:25.190 --> 03:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:27.349 --> 03:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
would include like towns Municipal
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
corporations School District school
 
03:11:30.769 --> 03:11:30.779 align:start position:0%
administrative units
 
03:11:33.889 --> 03:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
um and so that is where the idea for
 
03:11:37.130 --> 03:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
let's just call it local public bodies
 
03:11:39.050 --> 03:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
so that we can just deal with the towns
 
03:11:42.530 --> 03:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
the municipalities the folks who are
 
03:11:42.540 --> 03:11:43.969 align:start position:0%
the municipalities the folks who are
um

03:11:43.969 --> 03:11:43.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:43.979 --> 03:11:46.030 align:start position:0%
um
really

03:11:46.030 --> 03:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:11:49.010 --> 03:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
strongly encouraging and urging us to do
 
03:11:51.110 --> 03:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation yeah so the general
 
03:11:53.870 --> 03:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
court is not involved in this at all the
 
03:11:56.030 --> 03:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
drafter told me it was not necessary to
 
03:11:58.309 --> 03:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
have that line in there that it excludes
 
03:12:00.290 --> 03:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
the general court already
 
03:12:01.969 --> 03:12:01.979 align:start position:0%
because of the definition of local
 
03:12:06.650 --> 03:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:09.590 --> 03:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't your intention then to
 
03:12:11.269 --> 03:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
actually exclude the general court my
 
03:12:13.910 --> 03:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
concern is that right now the way that
 
03:12:16.070 --> 03:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
the law stands if the speaker wanted to
 
03:12:17.870 --> 03:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
due to an emergency or something like
 
03:12:20.450 --> 03:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
that he could allow because 918 is
 
03:12:22.730 --> 03:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
allowing it but if you're removing that
 
03:12:24.830 --> 03:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
from this paragraph and there was an
 
03:12:28.010 --> 03:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
emergency for some reason then
 
03:12:29.750 --> 03:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't be he wouldn't have the
 
03:12:31.190 --> 03:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
power to allow that unless we had
 
03:12:33.469 --> 03:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
amended the house rules and so that's my
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
concern so he would have the power to do
 
03:12:40.010 --> 03:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
that under what already exists in Roman
 
03:12:44.450 --> 03:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
it would just have your
 
03:12:50.030 --> 03:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
no so that's what the amendment does not
 
03:12:53.210 --> 03:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
remove it the amendment adds an extra
 
03:12:57.710 --> 03:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
session section that's though so
 
03:13:01.309 --> 03:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
it was a repeal and replace and now it's
 
03:13:03.830 --> 03:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
just an addition so it leaves in what's
 
03:13:05.990 --> 03:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
already in statute and it makes an
 
03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:11.090 align:start position:0%
already in statute and it makes an
addition

03:13:11.090 --> 03:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:19.610 --> 03:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:22.150 --> 03:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
two examples of another it's a music
 
03:13:24.650 --> 03:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
good okay great no thank you I
 
03:13:26.750 --> 03:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate you saying that so that stays
 
03:13:29.150 --> 03:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
the same yeah other questions for this
 
03:13:29.160 --> 03:13:30.469 align:start position:0%
the same yeah other questions for this
Witness

03:13:30.469 --> 03:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
03:13:32.269 --> 03:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
yes representative Andrews
 
03:13:34.670 --> 03:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:13:38.690 --> 03:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is line
 
03:13:44.030 --> 03:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
14. the two words reasonably practical
 
03:13:46.370 --> 03:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
what is the definition of those two
 
03:13:49.429 --> 03:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
words in here and should it be listed
 
03:13:53.269 --> 03:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
what is reasonably practical
 
03:13:53.279 --> 03:13:54.769 align:start position:0%
what is reasonably practical
so

03:13:54.769 --> 03:13:54.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:13:57.830 --> 03:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
my first answer is it's really for the
 
03:14:00.950 --> 03:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
governing body to decide and the local
 
03:14:03.170 --> 03:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
public body to decide what's reasonably
 
03:14:03.180 --> 03:14:05.570 align:start position:0%
public body to decide what's reasonably
practical

03:14:05.570 --> 03:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
practical
 
03:14:10.370 --> 03:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
um my second is that um
 
03:14:14.750 --> 03:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
this is language that of um a former
 
03:14:17.030 --> 03:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
member of of the Judiciary Committee and
 
03:14:19.490 --> 03:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders worked at for quite
 
03:14:22.370 --> 03:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
some time to come up with and felt that
 
03:14:25.550 --> 03:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
that was a good way to State it so that
 
03:14:29.210 --> 03:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
you left the towns with enough local
 
03:14:32.929 --> 03:14:32.939 align:start position:0%
um enough local control but not complete
 
03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
free reign
 
03:14:37.070 --> 03:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
okay does that make sense and I think
 
03:14:40.190 --> 03:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
I'll also ask um that if if Nate Graves
 
03:14:41.750 --> 03:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
from the municipal Association would
 
03:14:43.370 --> 03:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
also address that I think he'd have some
 
03:14:45.110 --> 03:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
insight into that as well
 
03:14:47.630 --> 03:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
03:14:47.640 --> 03:14:48.650 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this

03:15:13.969 --> 03:15:13.979 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
03:15:15.469 --> 03:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
Joshua Kella
 
03:15:17.750 --> 03:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
um from Rockingham 32 Fremont Danville
 
03:15:20.809 --> 03:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:26.090 --> 03:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
um I am testifying in support of the HB
 
03:15:30.349 --> 03:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
254 as I'm a co-sponsor on the bill
 
03:15:33.469 --> 03:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
um and I have looked at the uh the
 
03:15:35.690 --> 03:15:35.700 align:start position:0%
amendment and I was part of that working
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
group that actually drafted
 
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
um the original language
 
03:15:44.450 --> 03:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
um and so uh one of the things that is
 
03:15:46.730 --> 03:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
being changed
 
03:15:48.710 --> 03:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
um is that
 
03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
it is allowing more control at the local
 
03:15:57.050 --> 03:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
level for restricting if if a governing
 
03:16:00.610 --> 03:16:00.620 align:start position:0%
body is not handling their remote access
 
03:16:05.150 --> 03:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
properly then this law would now be able
 
03:16:05.160 --> 03:16:06.610 align:start position:0%
properly then this law would now be able
to

03:16:06.610 --> 03:16:06.620 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:16:09.830 --> 03:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
allow for some restriction of that
 
03:16:12.410 --> 03:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
whereas in current law it's just they're
 
03:16:14.809 --> 03:16:14.819 align:start position:0%
they're able to do remote access by
 
03:16:18.410 --> 03:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
right and so there is a
 
03:16:21.710 --> 03:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
the local public body is allowed to vote
 
03:16:23.990 --> 03:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
to disallow
 
03:16:28.130 --> 03:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
um remote options that is one change
 
03:16:28.140 --> 03:16:29.929 align:start position:0%
um remote options that is one change
also

03:16:29.929 --> 03:16:29.939 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:16:33.830 --> 03:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
um regarding the uh town meeting
 
03:16:36.110 --> 03:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh language being added to this
 
03:16:40.130 --> 03:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
amendment town meeting is uh also
 
03:16:45.190 --> 03:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
includes a deliberative session and uh
 
03:16:48.530 --> 03:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
the sb2 voting day that is all
 
03:16:49.849 --> 03:16:49.859 align:start position:0%
considered town meeting is just
 
03:16:51.290 --> 03:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
different ways of describing town
 
03:16:55.130 --> 03:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
meeting and so we will verify that that
 
03:16:58.490 --> 03:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
school town meetings are this are
 
03:17:01.670 --> 03:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
covered under the exception and not
 
03:17:03.830 --> 03:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to have remote remote access
 
03:17:05.510 --> 03:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
because that was not the intention of
 
03:17:08.090 --> 03:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
like you know how would you uh you know
 
03:17:09.710 --> 03:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
check someone's ID and stuff like that
 
03:17:11.150 --> 03:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
all remotely and make sure you're
 
03:17:12.830 --> 03:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
eligible to vote it doesn't make any
 
03:17:14.150 --> 03:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
sense so we're going to make sure that
 
03:17:15.889 --> 03:17:15.899 align:start position:0%
that gets cleaned up before your
 
03:17:17.750 --> 03:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
03:17:17.760 --> 03:17:18.830 align:start position:0%
executive session
um

03:17:18.830 --> 03:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:22.670 --> 03:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
so this also uh
 
03:17:24.590 --> 03:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
I do believe that the reasonably
 
03:17:26.690 --> 03:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
practical language
 
03:17:30.110 --> 03:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
um as far as uh remote attendance is
 
03:17:32.990 --> 03:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
already current law as far as like um
 
03:17:35.570 --> 03:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
people being able to understand uh
 
03:17:37.130 --> 03:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're allowed to be
 
03:17:40.429 --> 03:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
doing remote uh attendance to their
 
03:17:44.450 --> 03:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
meeting and this is also uh and it is
 
03:17:46.670 --> 03:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
decided by the board
 
03:17:52.429 --> 03:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
um that that uh so if I'm on the uh zba
 
03:17:55.130 --> 03:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
I actually did attend a zba meeting
 
03:17:57.950 --> 03:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
remotely and the board actually the
 
03:18:00.830 --> 03:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
people in attendance decided whether I
 
03:18:03.290 --> 03:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
it was reasonably practical for me to
 
03:18:05.570 --> 03:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
have attended in person and so that is
 
03:18:08.450 --> 03:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
how the current uh
 
03:18:12.410 --> 03:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
law is and so um also
 
03:18:16.610 --> 03:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
I wanted to clarify
 
03:18:19.309 --> 03:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:18:21.710 --> 03:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
the the quorum
 
03:18:24.230 --> 03:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
the the intention of this bill was not
 
03:18:28.309 --> 03:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
to mandate that just because uh the the
 
03:18:31.070 --> 03:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
members of the board have remote access
 
03:18:34.070 --> 03:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
that it's also forcing those that the
 
03:18:36.769 --> 03:18:36.779 align:start position:0%
municipality to force remote attendance
 
03:18:40.130 --> 03:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
by by uh non-members of the board so
 
03:18:41.929 --> 03:18:41.939 align:start position:0%
this is just focused on the remote
 
03:18:46.010 --> 03:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
attendance of the board itself uh and
 
03:18:48.769 --> 03:18:48.779 align:start position:0%
you know leaving the option open as far
 
03:18:51.290 --> 03:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
as remote attendance and whether they
 
03:18:53.570 --> 03:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
are hearing testimony remotely
 
03:18:56.210 --> 03:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
um based on if they have the capacity to
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
do so because there are technologies
 
03:19:01.309 --> 03:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
that you know depending on how many
 
03:19:03.290 --> 03:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
people are in attendance it costs more
 
03:19:06.410 --> 03:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
money and so if you have like a smaller
 
03:19:08.690 --> 03:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
Zoom plan or something like that you
 
03:19:10.490 --> 03:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
might only be able to
 
03:19:14.990 --> 03:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
um have the actual members uh be able to
 
03:19:17.389 --> 03:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
attend and wouldn't be able to control
 
03:19:19.550 --> 03:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
like the um the
 
03:19:22.130 --> 03:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
the entire you know population being
 
03:19:25.450 --> 03:19:25.460 align:start position:0%
able to tend uh remotely
 
03:19:25.460 --> 03:19:27.230 align:start position:0%
able to tend uh remotely
and

03:19:27.230 --> 03:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that is
 
03:19:33.530 --> 03:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
all that I had to clarify if if you had
 
03:19:35.570 --> 03:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
any more questions or detailed questions
 
03:19:35.580 --> 03:19:36.769 align:start position:0%
any more questions or detailed questions
about

03:19:36.769 --> 03:19:36.779 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:19:40.510 --> 03:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:43.010 --> 03:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Lorenzo thank
 
03:19:43.020 --> 03:19:44.090 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Lorenzo thank
you

03:19:44.090 --> 03:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:19:45.830 --> 03:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you for
 
03:19:47.570 --> 03:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question absolutely so you
 
03:19:48.950 --> 03:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
know towards the end of your um
 
03:19:53.450 --> 03:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
presentation you mentioned that um
 
03:19:57.469 --> 03:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's costly on Zoom to
 
03:19:59.929 --> 03:19:59.939 align:start position:0%
um you know have a larger audience it's
 
03:20:02.269 --> 03:20:02.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of participations
 
03:20:05.630 --> 03:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
um it's a cost really enough that it
 
03:20:07.070 --> 03:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
would limit
 
03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
um municipalities of public bodies from
 
03:20:12.349 --> 03:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
having meetings
 
03:20:14.750 --> 03:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think that
 
03:20:16.910 --> 03:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
the um the purpose of the bill was not
 
03:20:19.790 --> 03:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
to mandate that the local municipalities
 
03:20:22.130 --> 03:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
have that technology or that higher
 
03:20:26.170 --> 03:20:26.180 align:start position:0%
level plan it's just trying to address
 
03:20:29.210 --> 03:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
the board process and whether or not
 
03:20:31.730 --> 03:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to and how many members
 
03:20:34.910 --> 03:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
are allowed to vote be in attendance
 
03:20:38.090 --> 03:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
remotely and and the remote
 
03:20:41.030 --> 03:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
participation by members of the public
 
03:20:43.010 --> 03:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
was kind of outside the scope of this
 
03:20:45.830 --> 03:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
bill it was the intention so thank you
 
03:20:47.990 --> 03:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely other questions for this
 
03:20:50.630 --> 03:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
witness representative Tripp
 
03:20:52.570 --> 03:20:52.580 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you
 
03:20:54.710 --> 03:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:20:54.720 --> 03:20:58.610 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
uh

03:20:58.610 --> 03:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:58.620 --> 03:21:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:06.410 --> 03:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
the amendment would would allow
 
03:21:11.570 --> 03:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:13.130 --> 03:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
which would uh
 
03:21:16.309 --> 03:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh in in my mind
 
03:21:20.210 --> 03:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
since uh the meetings have to be uh
 
03:21:23.389 --> 03:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
the discussion has to be uh
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh people have to be able to listen to
 
03:21:27.830 --> 03:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
it and everything so so does this
 
03:21:31.190 --> 03:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
actually mandate that uh if it if the
 
03:21:33.170 --> 03:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
meeting is being held remotely
 
03:21:35.929 --> 03:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
that uh people would have the same
 
03:21:39.889 --> 03:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
technology as is being used by
 
03:21:41.929 --> 03:21:41.939 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:21:47.929 --> 03:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:49.730 --> 03:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I'm not an
 
03:21:52.190 --> 03:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
entirely sure that I understand it but
 
03:21:54.550 --> 03:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try and uh
 
03:21:58.610 --> 03:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
answer both kind of possibilities of the
 
03:22:01.250 --> 03:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
of your question I think
 
03:22:01.260 --> 03:22:02.690 align:start position:0%
of your question I think
um it's

03:22:02.690 --> 03:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
03:22:07.309 --> 03:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
I am unclear on whether you're you're uh
 
03:22:10.550 --> 03:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
saying that whether the bill requires
 
03:22:12.889 --> 03:22:12.899 align:start position:0%
that the other members of the board be
 
03:22:16.969 --> 03:22:16.979 align:start position:0%
able to to uh uh discuss things and see
 
03:22:18.590 --> 03:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
each other and have the same technology
 
03:22:22.730 --> 03:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
and that is addressed on um line 17 of
 
03:22:24.830 --> 03:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment to line 22 of the
 
03:22:27.650 --> 03:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
amendment where the um
 
03:22:29.990 --> 03:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
where each member or specifically
 
03:22:32.269 --> 03:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
starting on 18 each member participating
 
03:22:33.889 --> 03:22:33.899 align:start position:0%
electronically or otherwise shall be
 
03:22:37.690 --> 03:22:37.700 align:start position:0%
able to contemporarily when competent
 
03:22:39.889 --> 03:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously and throughout the
 
03:22:42.170 --> 03:22:42.180 align:start position:0%
meeting see and hear and be seen and
 
03:22:44.389 --> 03:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
heard by the other members of the public
 
03:22:46.429 --> 03:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
body in the meeting so yes they would be
 
03:22:48.349 --> 03:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
required that all the meetings would be
 
03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
all of the members of the board would be
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
able to see and talk to each other and
 
03:22:55.910 --> 03:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know have that full communication
 
03:22:59.889 --> 03:22:59.899 align:start position:0%
and then you're if you meant that the
 
03:23:03.349 --> 03:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
attendees be able to see then that is
 
03:23:06.410 --> 03:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
addressed on line 23 to line 25 which
 
03:23:08.750 --> 03:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
says that all members
 
03:23:08.760 --> 03:23:09.410 align:start position:0%
says that all members
um

03:23:09.410 --> 03:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:12.349 --> 03:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
shall be Audible and or visible to the
 
03:23:15.229 --> 03:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
public in attendance
 
03:23:17.690 --> 03:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
at the meeting's physical location so
 
03:23:20.150 --> 03:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's not mandating that everyone that
 
03:23:22.610 --> 03:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
attends the meeting actually have a zoom
 
03:23:25.550 --> 03:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
but that they be able to hear or see the
 
03:23:28.309 --> 03:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
people that are attending in Zoom let's
 
03:23:30.710 --> 03:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
say for example having a TV set up in
 
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
front of the
 
03:23:34.010 --> 03:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
um that is just pointed at the audience
 
03:23:35.690 --> 03:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
so that everyone would be able to see
 
03:23:37.490 --> 03:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
that is in the audience but not
 
03:23:40.429 --> 03:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily attend remotely right
 
03:23:43.550 --> 03:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
03:23:46.370 --> 03:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
for this witness the only question that
 
03:23:48.530 --> 03:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
I have done representative ukella is um
 
03:23:51.050 --> 03:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
will you and representatives we probably
 
03:23:53.750 --> 03:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
will I'm not we haven't agreed on this
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
yet but I'm thinking we probably will
 
03:23:58.550 --> 03:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
exec this bill in about two weeks and
 
03:24:01.190 --> 03:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
will you be able to have the amendment
 
03:24:03.349 --> 03:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
with the town meetings this sort of
 
03:24:05.990 --> 03:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
stuff to representative page transition
 
03:24:08.510 --> 03:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
time for us to do that thank you for the
 
03:24:11.630 --> 03:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
question yes I'm I'm in frequent contact
 
03:24:13.490 --> 03:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
with the representative and the
 
03:24:16.370 --> 03:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
municipal Association and so I'm ha I'm
 
03:24:18.469 --> 03:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
I mean I could have done it much sooner
 
03:24:20.630 --> 03:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
than two weeks so I am have strong
 
03:24:22.130 --> 03:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
confidence that it will be ready for you
 
03:24:23.990 --> 03:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you all
 
03:24:26.929 --> 03:24:26.939 align:start position:0%
right thank you uh next I uh represent

I'm sorry not representative but Karen
 
03:24:29.460 --> 03:24:33.229 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry not representative but Karen
Hill

03:24:33.229 --> 03:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:33.239 --> 03:24:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:24:38.150 --> 03:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:39.769 --> 03:24:39.779 align:start position:0%
good afternoon you know we have a number
 
03:24:41.870 --> 03:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
of other Witnesses on this and and uh
 
03:24:43.729 --> 03:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
the clock it's lunch here so I guess
 
03:24:45.050 --> 03:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
what I what I would say is I don't want
 
03:24:47.809 --> 03:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
to inhibit anyone from testifying but I
 
03:24:49.370 --> 03:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
would you've all heard sort of what
 
03:24:51.889 --> 03:24:51.899 align:start position:0%
other people have said and so I I would
 
03:24:53.929 --> 03:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
hope that you will tell us new things
 
03:24:55.610 --> 03:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
that we haven't heard rather than just
 
03:24:56.929 --> 03:24:56.939 align:start position:0%
kind of repeating what other people have
 
03:24:59.510 --> 03:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
said Thank you thank you very much Mr
 
03:25:01.550 --> 03:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee my
 
03:25:03.769 --> 03:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
name is Karen Leo Hill I am a city
 
03:25:06.889 --> 03:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
councilor in Lebanon and I'm here to
 
03:25:09.170 --> 03:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
voice strong support for this bill on
 
03:25:11.809 --> 03:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
behalf of the city and also to request a
 
03:25:14.090 --> 03:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
one-word Amendment
 
03:25:15.950 --> 03:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
um if someone would be willing to bring
 
03:25:19.070 --> 03:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
that forward the city of Lebanon um over
 
03:25:21.050 --> 03:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
I have served as the city councilor and
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
also the former mayor over the last 18
 
03:25:27.110 --> 03:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
years and so I have seen varying levels
 
03:25:30.110 --> 03:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
of participation I have seen almost all
 
03:25:32.450 --> 03:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
of the potential ways that people can
 
03:25:34.429 --> 03:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
participate or be prevented from
 
03:25:36.349 --> 03:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
participating and what I have seen over
 
03:25:37.849 --> 03:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
the last three years
 
03:25:40.729 --> 03:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
um during the pandemic is that the
 
03:25:42.889 --> 03:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
remote the ability for people to
 
03:25:45.410 --> 03:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
participate remotely has been good both
 
03:25:47.590 --> 03:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
for the city council
 
03:25:50.269 --> 03:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
just last night we had a city councilor
 
03:25:52.309 --> 03:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
actually two city councilors were in
 
03:25:54.590 --> 03:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
covid quarantine and they were able to
 
03:25:56.510 --> 03:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
participate in the meeting
 
03:25:59.210 --> 03:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
remotely and so we were able to benefit
 
03:26:01.969 --> 03:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
from their contributions when there's
 
03:26:03.729 --> 03:26:03.739 align:start position:0%
only nine of you
 
03:26:06.410 --> 03:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
each voice is really important to the
 
03:26:08.690 --> 03:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
deliberative process and in some
 
03:26:10.490 --> 03:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
communities there can be as few as three
 
03:26:12.710 --> 03:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
people who are responsible for making
 
03:26:16.010 --> 03:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
decisions and so the city of Lebanon
 
03:26:18.050 --> 03:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
strongly believes that this bill is
 
03:26:20.570 --> 03:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
beneficial for good government to be
 
03:26:21.969 --> 03:26:21.979 align:start position:0%
able to continue
 
03:26:25.969 --> 03:26:25.979 align:start position:0%
despite weather despite illness despite
 
03:26:27.469 --> 03:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
any of those things that can come up
 
03:26:29.750 --> 03:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is consistent with local
 
03:26:33.170 --> 03:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
control it is enabling it does not
 
03:26:36.170 --> 03:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
mandate that communities must do this it
 
03:26:38.929 --> 03:26:38.939 align:start position:0%
merely provides the option so that if a
 
03:26:40.429 --> 03:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
local community feels that it is
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them they can go ahead
 
03:26:45.710 --> 03:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
and adopt it and it does have safeguards
 
03:26:47.990 --> 03:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
in place by having the requirement that
 
03:26:51.229 --> 03:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
a physical meeting does take place with
 
03:26:53.570 --> 03:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
at least a third of the board that
 
03:26:55.729 --> 03:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
ensures that public meetings as they
 
03:26:57.650 --> 03:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
should while
 
03:27:00.410 --> 03:27:00.420 align:start position:0%
meeting the need or meeting the desire
 
03:27:02.690 --> 03:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
to have people be able to participate
 
03:27:05.690 --> 03:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
remotely lastly I'll just address the
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
amendment you may have heard about the
 
03:27:10.190 --> 03:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
community power Coalition of New
 
03:27:12.729 --> 03:27:12.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is a
 
03:27:16.130 --> 03:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
this is an effort of cities and towns
 
03:27:19.010 --> 03:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
local governments including counties to
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
pool efforts to get lower prices for
 
03:27:28.610 --> 03:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
energy it is an instrumentality of local
 
03:27:31.670 --> 03:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
government and there are more than 20
 
03:27:33.710 --> 03:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
communities that are involved so far
 
03:27:36.469 --> 03:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
stretching all the way from each corner
 
03:27:40.130 --> 03:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
of the state and so I'm here some of you
 
03:27:42.290 --> 03:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
may have served with Clifton below who
 
03:27:44.090 --> 03:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
is currently our assistant mayor and
 
03:27:45.769 --> 03:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
he's also chairing the community power
 
03:27:48.590 --> 03:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
Coalition of New Hampshire and he has
 
03:27:51.309 --> 03:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
asked saying that it would provide
 
03:27:54.530 --> 03:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
really be very helpful in order to meet
 
03:27:56.510 --> 03:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
Quorum issues and to allow the
 
03:27:58.870 --> 03:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
functioning of this and entity
 
03:28:02.750 --> 03:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
if the word instrumentalities of local
 
03:28:04.849 --> 03:28:04.859 align:start position:0%
government could be added so that it
 
03:28:06.170 --> 03:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
would address the community power
 
03:28:08.929 --> 03:28:08.939 align:start position:0%
Coalition it would be a very narrow that
 
03:28:10.849 --> 03:28:10.859 align:start position:0%
is a very narrow addition that we're
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
requesting and I bring that to you today
 
03:28:15.590 --> 03:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
at the request of Cliff below and the
 
03:28:21.170 --> 03:28:21.180 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair hello again
 
03:29:13.969 --> 03:29:13.979 align:start position:0%
um I'll jump right into it right to know
 
03:29:16.490 --> 03:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is opposed to Bill HB for
 
03:29:18.830 --> 03:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh 254 which is designed to alter the
 
03:29:20.570 --> 03:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
requirements for remote participation by
 
03:29:22.729 --> 03:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
public officials we recognize the
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
advantages that remote access has
 
03:29:26.269 --> 03:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
provided to engage citizens and public
 
03:29:28.429 --> 03:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
officials everywhere but there are
 
03:29:30.290 --> 03:29:30.300 align:start position:0%
challenges that are posed by the use of
 
03:29:32.090 --> 03:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
technology and many of those still
 
03:29:34.969 --> 03:29:34.979 align:start position:0%
remain to be resolved to explain those I
 
03:29:36.410 --> 03:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
have actually attached an additional
 
03:29:38.630 --> 03:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
backgrounder to my testimony that I am
 
03:29:41.450 --> 03:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
happy to share electronically and answer
 
03:29:42.830 --> 03:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
questions any questions about our
 
03:29:45.110 --> 03:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
position on that it provides some
 
03:29:46.309 --> 03:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
insight into right to know New
 
03:29:47.990 --> 03:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's concerns and considerations
 
03:29:50.809 --> 03:29:50.819 align:start position:0%
about remote meetings in general and
 
03:29:52.929 --> 03:29:52.939 align:start position:0%
many members of our group have testified
 
03:29:56.090 --> 03:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
in Concord on this issue for several
 
03:29:59.330 --> 03:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
years in a row now our membership did do
 
03:30:01.370 --> 03:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
specific to this bill a full comparison
 
03:30:03.050 --> 03:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
of the existing and proposed language
 
03:30:04.969 --> 03:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
and I believe that even with the
 
03:30:07.370 --> 03:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
amendment these comments still stand
 
03:30:10.849 --> 03:30:10.859 align:start position:0%
the first issue is that by saying that
 
03:30:12.590 --> 03:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
the low and I think now the language has
 
03:30:13.969 --> 03:30:13.979 align:start position:0%
changed from governing body of a
 
03:30:15.410 --> 03:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
political subdivision to local
 
03:30:15.420 --> 03:30:17.030 align:start position:0%
political subdivision to local
governments

03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
governments
 
03:30:19.849 --> 03:30:19.859 align:start position:0%
um may may be authorized to participate
 
03:30:21.769 --> 03:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
in remote meetings this bill effectively
 
03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
creates a distinction between how local
 
03:30:25.370 --> 03:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
and state-level public bodies are able
 
03:30:27.370 --> 03:30:27.380 align:start position:0%
to make use of remote meeting technology
 
03:30:30.830 --> 03:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions are well that I
 
03:30:32.570 --> 03:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
don't think applies anymore under the
 
03:30:34.190 --> 03:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
amendment the political subdivision
 
03:30:36.530 --> 03:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
piece but it still raises a question of
 
03:30:38.330 --> 03:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
what's the authorization Authority at
 
03:30:40.550 --> 03:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
the state level and the language as it
 
03:30:42.889 --> 03:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
stands implies that state bodies may not
 
03:30:45.469 --> 03:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
allow remote participation second there
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
is contradictory language in here that
 
03:30:49.729 --> 03:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
requires the members of the public body
 
03:30:52.429 --> 03:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
be Audible and visible to each other
 
03:30:55.790 --> 03:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
under item C but not to members of the
 
03:30:58.550 --> 03:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
public to whom they must be audible or
 
03:31:01.190 --> 03:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
visible which is under item D this
 
03:31:02.690 --> 03:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
creates an imbalance of the information
 
03:31:04.670 --> 03:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
that's available to members of the
 
03:31:06.830 --> 03:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
public body versus those that are in the
 
03:31:09.290 --> 03:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
public it also raises questions about
 
03:31:12.050 --> 03:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
the technology that's to be used does
 
03:31:13.550 --> 03:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
this language now require video
 
03:31:15.830 --> 03:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
conferencing is that video able to be
 
03:31:17.990 --> 03:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
used only between public officials but
 
03:31:20.990 --> 03:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
not be seen by the General Public
 
03:31:22.969 --> 03:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
third this bill removes critical
 
03:31:25.190 --> 03:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
requirements that the location of the
 
03:31:27.229 --> 03:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
meeting must be given in the look in the
 
03:31:30.110 --> 03:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
notice meeting notice and that all votes
 
03:31:32.510 --> 03:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
taken during a remote meeting must be
 
03:31:34.849 --> 03:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
taken by roll call vote I think some of
 
03:31:37.130 --> 03:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
the changes from the original statute to
 
03:31:38.630 --> 03:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
the draft you have in front of you were
 
03:31:40.670 --> 03:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
not necessarily intentional but when you
 
03:31:42.590 --> 03:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
do a line by line comparison there are
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
changes like that that are substantive
 
03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
finally item C provides an alternative
 
03:31:49.610 --> 03:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
to the Quorum requirement for meetings
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to move forward
 
03:31:54.349 --> 03:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
instead of a quorum it requires that
 
03:31:56.150 --> 03:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
only a third of the public body if that
 
03:31:57.830 --> 03:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
number is less than the Quorum would
 
03:31:59.809 --> 03:31:59.819 align:start position:0%
need to have a physical presence the
 
03:32:01.790 --> 03:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
language and item C is very confusing
 
03:32:02.929 --> 03:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to get in the weeds a
 
03:32:05.150 --> 03:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
little bit about this the main question
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
is why would we provide an alternative
 
03:32:09.769 --> 03:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
definition of a quorum a quorum can
 
03:32:11.690 --> 03:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
often be defined by the public body
 
03:32:13.790 --> 03:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
itself or by the governing body that is
 
03:32:15.349 --> 03:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
over it so if they wanted to have less
 
03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
than the current Quorum number they
 
03:32:18.830 --> 03:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
there's usually a mechanism for making
 
03:32:20.030 --> 03:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
that change
 
03:32:22.910 --> 03:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
item C is further contradicted by a
 
03:32:24.650 --> 03:32:24.660 align:start position:0%
later statement that says a member
 
03:32:26.630 --> 03:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
participating in a meeting by the means
 
03:32:28.969 --> 03:32:28.979 align:start position:0%
described in this paragraph is deemed to
 
03:32:31.130 --> 03:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
be present for all purposes including
 
03:32:33.530 --> 03:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
for determination of a quorum
 
03:32:35.570 --> 03:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
if the physical participation is being
 
03:32:37.550 --> 03:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
used to determine the Quorum then those
 
03:32:39.590 --> 03:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
who are remote are not being counted in
 
03:32:41.330 --> 03:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
the Quorum despite what that sentence
 
03:32:41.340 --> 03:32:42.590 align:start position:0%
the Quorum despite what that sentence
says

03:32:42.590 --> 03:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:32:44.570 --> 03:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
the term all purposes is also
 
03:32:46.670 --> 03:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
exceptionally broad the power of a
 
03:32:48.530 --> 03:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
public body typically lies in its voting
 
03:32:50.450 --> 03:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
power which requires a presence of some
 
03:32:52.490 --> 03:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
kind using the phrase all purposes
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
raises a question about what other
 
03:32:56.030 --> 03:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
purposes does the public body being put
 
03:32:58.370 --> 03:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
to Beyond voting
 
03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
the reference to the Quorum requirement
 
03:33:02.330 --> 03:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
is also confused by the fact that item G
 
03:33:04.250 --> 03:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
below provides an exemption for
 
03:33:06.050 --> 03:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
emergencies but much later in the
 
03:33:08.210 --> 03:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
reading of the bill within the right to
 
03:33:09.830 --> 03:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
know law itself the language
 
03:33:12.050 --> 03:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
consistently used to note exemptions to
 
03:33:14.510 --> 03:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
a requirement prefaces that requirement
 
03:33:17.570 --> 03:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
by saying accept in an emergency comma
 
03:33:20.030 --> 03:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
and later it goes on to Define that
 
03:33:22.729 --> 03:33:22.739 align:start position:0%
emergency shall mean and explains that
 
03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
this standard language would be much
 
03:33:24.720 --> 03:33:26.809 align:start position:0%
this standard language would be much
clearer

03:33:26.809 --> 03:33:26.819 align:start position:0%
clearer
 
03:33:28.309 --> 03:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
there are elements of this bill that
 
03:33:29.690 --> 03:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
right to know New Hampshire does support
 
03:33:31.670 --> 03:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
giving the governing body the authority
 
03:33:33.290 --> 03:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not a public
 
03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
body can allow remote participation
 
03:33:37.370 --> 03:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
helps to clarify a consistent process
 
03:33:39.769 --> 03:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
for its use while the bill still allows
 
03:33:41.330 --> 03:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
for more stringent conditions if the
 
03:33:43.910 --> 03:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
local entity wants to consider those
 
03:33:45.590 --> 03:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
right to know New Hampshire and its
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
experience leadership many home of whom
 
03:33:49.969 --> 03:33:49.979 align:start position:0%
have testified here long before me would
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
be happy to discuss concerns about
 
03:33:53.389 --> 03:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
remote meetings with any legislator
 
03:33:55.610 --> 03:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
we've testified previously on that issue
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the language of this
 
03:33:59.150 --> 03:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill does not appear to be
 
03:34:01.610 --> 03:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
ready to legislate today we urge you to
 
03:34:03.410 --> 03:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill as inexpedient to
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislate tomorrow we encourage the
 
03:34:08.450 --> 03:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
creation of an ongoing conversation and
 
03:34:10.190 --> 03:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
an analysis of the challenges we face
 
03:34:11.630 --> 03:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
when we're balancing the use of
 
03:34:13.190 --> 03:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
Technology with the public rights
 
03:34:14.809 --> 03:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
Public's right to know
 
03:34:17.809 --> 03:34:17.819 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this Witness
 
03:34:19.849 --> 03:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:34:23.170 --> 03:34:23.180 align:start position:0%
Carla uh
 
03:34:28.070 --> 03:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:30.349 --> 03:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman and the committee
 
03:34:32.809 --> 03:34:32.819 align:start position:0%
uh Carla Garrick for the record uh again
 
03:34:35.269 --> 03:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
testifying as myself and as a board
 
03:34:37.370 --> 03:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
member of right to know New Hampshire I
 
03:34:39.290 --> 03:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
know everyone wants to go to lunch so I
 
03:34:41.809 --> 03:34:41.819 align:start position:0%
will make this very quick I concur with
 
03:34:43.610 --> 03:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
the previous statement
 
03:34:45.590 --> 03:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm very torn I'm a techie
 
03:34:48.250 --> 03:34:48.260 align:start position:0%
person I love technology so I definitely
 
03:34:51.229 --> 03:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a direction we
 
03:34:53.630 --> 03:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
want to move in but I don't think this
 
03:34:56.809 --> 03:34:56.819 align:start position:0%
bill is the right way to do it so I
 
03:34:59.210 --> 03:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to itl this and then
 
03:35:01.610 --> 03:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
to start a conversation I think it's
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
important to note that the conversation
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
and the testimony in favor of this bill
 
03:35:08.870 --> 03:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
only talked about how it would be easy
 
03:35:11.210 --> 03:35:11.220 align:start position:0%
for the people who serve and of course
 
03:35:13.729 --> 03:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
we appreciate everyone who serves but
 
03:35:16.670 --> 03:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
you serve on behalf of the public and so
 
03:35:20.210 --> 03:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
these bills need to accommodate the
 
03:35:22.790 --> 03:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
public and not make it easier for the
 
03:35:24.650 --> 03:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
people who are serving the public but
 
03:35:27.170 --> 03:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
indeed for the public I would also say
 
03:35:29.690 --> 03:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
that as we explore floor this area an
 
03:35:31.130 --> 03:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
important thing I noticed that is
 
03:35:33.530 --> 03:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
missing from this is I would encourage
 
03:35:36.250 --> 03:35:36.260 align:start position:0%
us to put in language that talks about
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
these kinds of remote meetings then of
 
03:35:41.750 --> 03:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
course being recorded and also being
 
03:35:44.929 --> 03:35:44.939 align:start position:0%
subject to the right to know bills so
 
03:35:47.570 --> 03:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
that we just make sure as we move into
 
03:35:49.910 --> 03:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
this direction we're actually creating a
 
03:35:53.150 --> 03:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
greater public body and public work for
 
03:35:55.490 --> 03:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
the public because that is actually why
 
03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
we are all here I haven't looked at the
 
03:36:01.190 --> 03:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
line items on the amendment yet but I
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
would encourage this committee if you do
 
03:36:06.050 --> 03:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
proceed for whatever reason I do think
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a very close reading
 
03:36:11.450 --> 03:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
of the language to the bill and there
 
03:36:13.790 --> 03:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
has been testimonies submitted uh
 
03:36:15.889 --> 03:36:15.899 align:start position:0%
electronically via email from some other
 
03:36:17.570 --> 03:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
right to know members that would help
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
you with that so I encourage you to go
 
03:36:23.750 --> 03:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
look at those emails so I would say due
 
03:36:26.510 --> 03:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
to the shortcomings of this bill I would
 
03:36:28.729 --> 03:36:28.739 align:start position:0%
like you to oppose it now but but again
 
03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
we are open to and we understand that
 
03:36:33.530 --> 03:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
there is a need for this but let's do it
 
03:36:35.090 --> 03:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
right from the start so that we don't
 
03:36:36.830 --> 03:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
make a mess and then we spend 20 years
 
03:36:39.290 --> 03:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
trying to fix it thank you
 
03:36:41.510 --> 03:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
any questions for this week
 
03:36:49.670 --> 03:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:51.590 --> 03:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair nature Grace for the
 
03:36:53.690 --> 03:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we support the
 
03:36:55.729 --> 03:36:55.739 align:start position:0%
bill we support the amendment
 
03:36:57.050 --> 03:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
um I know there were a couple specific
 
03:37:00.410 --> 03:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
questions committee members had asked um
 
03:37:03.349 --> 03:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh so representative Perez had asked
 
03:37:05.150 --> 03:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
about school meetings I don't know off
 
03:37:06.530 --> 03:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
the top of my head whether those were
 
03:37:06.540 --> 03:37:07.849 align:start position:0%
the top of my head whether those were
included

03:37:07.849 --> 03:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
included
 
03:37:10.670 --> 03:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
um as part of the exemption from
 
03:37:13.370 --> 03:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
people uh meetings where where remote
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
participation could occur
 
03:37:17.809 --> 03:37:17.819 align:start position:0%
um it that was not meant to be included
 
03:37:19.130 --> 03:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
so we'll make sure to get that language
 
03:37:19.140 --> 03:37:20.870 align:start position:0%
so we'll make sure to get that language
correct

03:37:20.870 --> 03:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:37:20.880 --> 03:37:21.590 align:start position:0%
correct
um

03:37:21.590 --> 03:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:23.929 --> 03:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
the term town meeting does cover as
 
03:37:26.929 --> 03:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
representative yokella indicated
 
03:37:28.910 --> 03:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
the whole event no matter what structure
 
03:37:30.349 --> 03:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
your town is so if you have a
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
deliberative session if you have a
 
03:37:33.769 --> 03:37:33.779 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting whatever your
 
03:37:35.870 --> 03:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
structure is that's that's the term as
 
03:37:38.809 --> 03:37:38.819 align:start position:0%
defined in the statutes elsewhere
 
03:37:38.819 --> 03:37:39.790 align:start position:0%
defined in the statutes elsewhere
um

03:37:39.790 --> 03:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:43.250 --> 03:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh I believe representative Andrus had a
 
03:37:44.929 --> 03:37:44.939 align:start position:0%
question about what reasonably practical
 
03:37:47.809 --> 03:37:47.819 align:start position:0%
means that's already in the statute
 
03:37:50.030 --> 03:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
um that has existed there uh for a long
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
time and it really captures the idea of
 
03:37:55.190 --> 03:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
you know why can't you show up and it
 
03:37:56.809 --> 03:37:56.819 align:start position:0%
has to be a good reason it can't be I
 
03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
didn't want to get off the couch and not
 
03:38:01.070 --> 03:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
drive to town meeting in town hall it
 
03:38:03.050 --> 03:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
has to be some legitimate reason like
 
03:38:05.330 --> 03:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
I'm in quarantine or you know something
 
03:38:08.269 --> 03:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
that that actually matters
 
03:38:08.279 --> 03:38:09.110 align:start position:0%
that that actually matters
um

03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:11.570 --> 03:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh representative Tripp asked a
 
03:38:14.030 --> 03:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
clarifying question about uh kind of the
 
03:38:16.010 --> 03:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
process so I just want to reiterate that
 
03:38:18.530 --> 03:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
this does not authorize totally remote
 
03:38:20.510 --> 03:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
remote meetings there still has to be a
 
03:38:22.849 --> 03:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
physical location at least one third of
 
03:38:25.550 --> 03:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
the public body has to be present at
 
03:38:27.710 --> 03:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
um and there are additional requirements
 
03:38:30.610 --> 03:38:30.620 align:start position:0%
for anyone who is participating remotely
 
03:38:32.570 --> 03:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:38:36.170 --> 03:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
information from them can be shared with
 
03:38:37.790 --> 03:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
other members of the board and the
 
03:38:41.450 --> 03:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
public so it's not an entirely it's not
 
03:38:43.130 --> 03:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
entirely remote meeting there's still a
 
03:38:45.650 --> 03:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
physical location for people to go to as
 
03:38:47.610 --> 03:38:47.620 align:start position:0%
already as required
 
03:38:47.620 --> 03:38:48.170 align:start position:0%
already as required
[Music]

03:38:48.170 --> 03:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:38:48.180 --> 03:38:49.190 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

03:38:49.190 --> 03:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:50.929 --> 03:38:50.939 align:start position:0%
other than that I just want to say since
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
you've you've seen at least uh you've
 
03:38:54.769 --> 03:38:54.779 align:start position:0%
seen one Municipal official uh We've
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
also heard from quite a few Municipal
 
03:38:58.969 --> 03:38:58.979 align:start position:0%
officials about their desire for
 
03:39:00.950 --> 03:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
something to go into effect to allow
 
03:39:03.290 --> 03:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
them greater flexibility with meetings
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
um because they recognize that
 
03:39:07.610 --> 03:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
um with the advance of Technology it is
 
03:39:09.590 --> 03:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
important that the government can
 
03:39:12.290 --> 03:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
respond in a similar manner to as
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
private business to events that occur
 
03:39:17.090 --> 03:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
and allow the participation of people
 
03:39:19.190 --> 03:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
who've traditionally been excluded
 
03:39:21.830 --> 03:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
such as the elderly who may not be able
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
to drive such as the disabled such as
 
03:39:26.990 --> 03:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
people who you know rely on others for
 
03:39:29.690 --> 03:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
transportation and we have seen uptake
 
03:39:31.309 --> 03:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
in that type of participation over the
 
03:39:33.170 --> 03:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
last few years and we want to continue
 
03:39:35.450 --> 03:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
to provide greater access for
 
03:39:37.910 --> 03:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
participation as members of the
 
03:39:39.889 --> 03:39:39.899 align:start position:0%
government because we are a government
 
03:39:43.130 --> 03:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
of the people and we want to continue to
 
03:39:46.490 --> 03:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
promote that for all the people thank
 
03:39:47.570 --> 03:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
you happy to answer any questions
 
03:39:49.309 --> 03:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
questions for this week
 
03:39:52.849 --> 03:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:00.950 --> 03:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:03.469 --> 03:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
meetings as a whole
 
03:40:03.479 --> 03:40:04.190 align:start position:0%
meetings as a whole
um

03:40:04.190 --> 03:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:06.290 --> 03:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
have made improvements to Public Access
 
03:40:08.210 --> 03:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
for people
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely so when I've talked with
 
03:40:11.040 --> 03:40:12.590 align:start position:0%
absolutely so when I've talked with
municipalities

03:40:12.590 --> 03:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:40:14.450 --> 03:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
um they've said as they've done things
 
03:40:16.849 --> 03:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
like streaming their meetings as they've
 
03:40:20.090 --> 03:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
done things like opening it up to uh
 
03:40:22.490 --> 03:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
more remote participation they've seen a
 
03:40:25.610 --> 03:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
pretty marked increase in in the public
 
03:40:27.769 --> 03:40:27.779 align:start position:0%
generally and especially people who
 
03:40:29.929 --> 03:40:29.939 align:start position:0%
wouldn't ordinarily be able to come down
 
03:40:32.210 --> 03:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
to town hall and sit through those so
 
03:40:34.190 --> 03:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
people who have young kids you know
 
03:40:35.210 --> 03:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get a babysitter
 
03:40:38.269 --> 03:40:38.279 align:start position:0%
for the night people who you know for
 
03:40:40.670 --> 03:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
whatever reason don't can't drive there
 
03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
or too far away or there's bad weather
 
03:40:44.450 --> 03:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
or whatever the case may be and they can
 
03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
continue doing the business of
 
03:40:46.910 --> 03:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
government so I think it's been a great
 
03:40:48.170 --> 03:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
Improvement on on how government
 
03:40:50.570 --> 03:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
functions thank you thank you are there
 
03:40:52.250 --> 03:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
03:40:53.690 --> 03:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
03:40:55.969 --> 03:40:55.979 align:start position:0%
thank you you may step down and I'm uh
 
03:40:57.530 --> 03:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
Karen Rosenberg please from the
 
03:41:00.410 --> 03:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
disabilities rights Center
 
03:41:02.450 --> 03:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
good afternoon welcome thank you I'm
 
03:41:03.950 --> 03:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
Karen Rosenberg the policy director of
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
the disability rights Center I know
 
03:41:07.849 --> 03:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
you're all starving so I'll be quick
 
03:41:10.070 --> 03:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
um in general we support the concept of
 
03:41:11.990 --> 03:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
this bill because
 
03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
um there you know we want to encourage
 
03:41:15.590 --> 03:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement in this state but we
 
03:41:17.330 --> 03:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
also don't want to thwart our public
 
03:41:19.269 --> 03:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
body's ability to get their work done
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement can include people with
 
03:41:23.450 --> 03:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
disabilities people who have experienced
 
03:41:25.309 --> 03:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
illness now we've learned about covid
 
03:41:28.610 --> 03:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
and need to quarantine so expanding the
 
03:41:31.210 --> 03:41:31.220 align:start position:0%
ability of public bodies to function
 
03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
despite some of these bumps in the road
 
03:41:35.750 --> 03:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
for participants that would encourage
 
03:41:37.729 --> 03:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
participants is a good thing from our
 
03:41:40.729 --> 03:41:40.739 align:start position:0%
perspective but only if the bill is
 
03:41:44.330 --> 03:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
amended to create a new section that
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
would not obliterate the current
 
03:41:49.550 --> 03:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
Protections in our current law that
 
03:41:52.070 --> 03:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
apply to other types of bodies that
 
03:41:54.410 --> 03:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be covered by this law so
 
03:41:54.420 --> 03:41:56.170 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be covered by this law so
current

03:41:56.170 --> 03:41:56.180 align:start position:0%
current
 
03:42:00.110 --> 03:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
91a2 Roman 3 which I'm sure I'm going to
 
03:42:03.070 --> 03:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
butcher your name representative cutoff
 
03:42:07.010 --> 03:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
astutely pointed out is really necessary
 
03:42:09.110 --> 03:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
so that when there's an emergency or
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
reasons that other public bodies can't
 
03:42:14.090 --> 03:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
meet or in person or not all their
 
03:42:15.710 --> 03:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
members can that they can continue to
 
03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
function if they meet the in-person
 
03:42:20.150 --> 03:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
Quorum requirement so as a member of the
 
03:42:22.429 --> 03:42:22.439 align:start position:0%
state advisory committee for children
 
03:42:23.929 --> 03:42:23.939 align:start position:0%
youth with disabilities this has been an
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
issue getting you know allowing parents
 
03:42:27.530 --> 03:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
of children with disabilities and
 
03:42:29.570 --> 03:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
parents with disabilities to participate
 
03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
by allowing them to access our meetings
 
03:42:34.849 --> 03:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
remotely if necessary so one other thing
 
03:42:37.309 --> 03:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
I wanted to encourage you to think about
 
03:42:41.269 --> 03:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
is how if there is going to be a remote
 
03:42:44.450 --> 03:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
option for public body particip members
 
03:42:47.809 --> 03:42:47.819 align:start position:0%
that that the public also be able to at
 
03:42:49.690 --> 03:42:49.700 align:start position:0%
the very least view those meetings
 
03:42:52.610 --> 03:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously again it's about Civic
 
03:42:54.590 --> 03:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
engagement encouraging engagement from
 
03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
people all over the state regardless of
 
03:42:59.150 --> 03:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
whether they have a disability or not or
 
03:43:02.389 --> 03:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
a communicable illness like covid that
 
03:43:05.809 --> 03:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
we've seen recently it's about making
 
03:43:08.269 --> 03:43:08.279 align:start position:0%
our government open and accessible to
 
03:43:10.849 --> 03:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
more folks so thank you great questions
 
03:43:12.349 --> 03:43:12.359 align:start position:0%

so can I just can I just ask one
 
03:43:16.429 --> 03:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
question are you comfortable with at
 
03:43:18.229 --> 03:43:18.239 align:start position:0%

03:43:20.090 --> 03:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable with the proposed
 
03:43:22.010 --> 03:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
amendment which would basically say
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
we're not repealing the existing section
 
03:43:26.990 --> 03:43:27.000 align:start position:0%

03:43:29.929 --> 03:43:29.939 align:start position:0%

03:43:51.469 --> 03:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
hearing on that bill
 
03:43:55.250 --> 03:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
um and now long last it will be time for
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
lunch I know that I said that we would
 
03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
have we would uh resume the hearing on
 
03:44:04.729 --> 03:44:04.739 align:start position:0%
uh 289 at one o'clock it's obviously
 
03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
you're not gonna have enough time for
 
03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
lunch if we do that I will be back here
 
03:44:11.630 --> 03:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock to recess that until but
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
can I say 1 30 does that give everybody
 
03:44:15.650 --> 03:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
enough time to come back by 1 30. all
 
03:44:17.210 --> 03:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
right so if you would all be back by 1
 
03:44:25.690 --> 03:44:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:28.130 --> 03:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
did I say I thought this let me go oh
 
03:44:34.370 --> 03:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:31.309 --> 04:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.050 --> 04:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
now it's actually actually a couple
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
minutes after one and I said we were
 
04:05:38.330 --> 04:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
recessing the hearing on HB 289 so 1 p.m
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
so for the record
 
04:05:42.410 --> 04:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
um it's a little after one we're gonna
 
04:05:44.330 --> 04:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh continue we're gonna recess that
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
further to 1 30. so at 1 30 we will
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
begin with uh HP 289 and then we'll go
 
04:05:53.210 --> 04:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
through uh the rest of the bills you
 
04:05:54.590 --> 04:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
know as quickly as possible after that
 
04:34:25.490 --> 04:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
Bill we have for hearing is House Bill
 
04:34:31.670 --> 04:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
289 uh originally scheduled for one 11
 
04:34:34.369 --> 04:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
30 but we recessed the hearing first to
 
04:34:36.410 --> 04:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
one and then to 1 30.
 
04:34:36.420 --> 04:34:40.570 align:start position:0%
one and then to 1 30.
um

04:34:40.570 --> 04:34:40.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:43.849 --> 04:34:43.859 align:start position:0%

307
um

04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:13.920 align:start position:0%

04:35:13.920 --> 04:35:18.650 align:start position:0%
um

04:35:18.650 --> 04:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:22.010 --> 04:35:22.020 align:start position:0%

04:35:31.869 --> 04:35:31.879 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna represent uh recognize
 
04:35:34.490 --> 04:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
04:35:36.289 --> 04:35:36.299 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
04:35:37.609 --> 04:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:35:40.131 --> 04:35:40.141 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan McGuire I represent the
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
town of Epsom
 
04:35:45.769 --> 04:35:45.779 align:start position:0%
this bill makes a small change to the
 
04:35:49.150 --> 04:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
right to know Law 91a
 
04:35:52.449 --> 04:35:52.459 align:start position:0%
related specifically to
 
04:35:55.369 --> 04:35:55.379 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees that may or may not get
 
04:35:55.379 --> 04:35:56.990 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees that may or may not get
paid

04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
paid
 
04:36:01.250 --> 04:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
um after the conclusion of a trial so
 
04:36:03.529 --> 04:36:03.539 align:start position:0%
um so we're in a situation where
 
04:36:04.970 --> 04:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
somebody asked for a certain amount
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
certain kind of information they were
 
04:36:10.990 --> 04:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
denied by the public body and then they
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
filed a lawsuit took it to court and won
 
04:36:18.590 --> 04:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
and then the question is should the
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
public body
 
04:36:22.849 --> 04:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
um cover their attorney's fees or not
 
04:36:26.869 --> 04:36:26.879 align:start position:0%
and So currently in current law it says
 
04:36:30.170 --> 04:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
that only if
 
04:36:33.529 --> 04:36:33.539 align:start position:0%
um the court has to make a judgment they
 
04:36:36.830 --> 04:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
have to say uh should they have known
 
04:36:38.269 --> 04:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
that they should have given this
 
04:36:40.670 --> 04:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
information and if so then they would
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
cover the attorney's fees we're changing
 
04:36:47.150 --> 04:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
it simply to in this case you you you're
 
04:36:50.810 --> 04:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
denied you go to court you win then your
 
04:36:52.970 --> 04:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees will be covered right
 
04:36:55.970 --> 04:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
and it's basically pretty simple you
 
04:36:58.609 --> 04:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
know we want public information to be
 
04:37:02.150 --> 04:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
available to people and we don't want
 
04:37:05.449 --> 04:37:05.459 align:start position:0%
the the process to be the punishment you
 
04:37:07.330 --> 04:37:07.340 align:start position:0%
know so somebody who needs information
 
04:37:10.429 --> 04:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
they go through all of this they get it
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
finally at the end of the day it
 
04:37:16.490 --> 04:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
shouldn't on top of that cost them fees
 
04:37:19.250 --> 04:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
so it's it's that simple thank you Mr
 
04:37:19.260 --> 04:37:21.170 align:start position:0%
so it's it's that simple thank you Mr
chair

04:37:21.170 --> 04:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:37:24.529 --> 04:37:24.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:26.209 --> 04:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Wallace did you
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:31.080 --> 04:37:32.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:37:32.029 --> 04:37:32.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
so uh I guess I do have one question
 
04:37:37.551 --> 04:37:37.561 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and the the
 
04:37:40.010 --> 04:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
language you propose is the court
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
renders a final judgment in favor of the
 
04:37:44.810 --> 04:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
requester so
 
04:37:46.970 --> 04:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
I mean this might be a somewhat unusual
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
situation but
 
04:37:52.189 --> 04:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
if the a final judgment in favor of the
 
04:37:52.199 --> 04:37:53.570 align:start position:0%
if the a final judgment in favor of the
requester

04:37:53.570 --> 04:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
requester
 
04:37:56.631 --> 04:37:56.641 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily mean
 
04:37:59.929 --> 04:37:59.939 align:start position:0%
that the requester got the information
 
04:38:02.029 --> 04:38:02.039 align:start position:0%
got some information and I guess what
 
04:38:03.949 --> 04:38:03.959 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of is this Suppose there
 
04:38:06.650 --> 04:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
was a lawsuit under the right to no law
 
04:38:09.890 --> 04:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
that that said
 
04:38:12.410 --> 04:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
something like
 
04:38:12.420 --> 04:38:13.551 align:start position:0%
something like
um

04:38:13.551 --> 04:38:13.561 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:16.490 --> 04:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
04:38:16.500 --> 04:38:18.769 align:start position:0%
you uh
u-town

04:38:18.769 --> 04:38:18.779 align:start position:0%
u-town
 
04:38:20.631 --> 04:38:20.641 align:start position:0%
um eventually you gave me the
 
04:38:22.910 --> 04:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
information I wanted but you took too
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
long and so I'm bringing a lawsuit
 
04:38:28.869 --> 04:38:28.879 align:start position:0%
saying uh I want
 
04:38:31.730 --> 04:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh you know I want a ruling from the
 
04:38:33.769 --> 04:38:33.779 align:start position:0%
court that you're not going to do this
 
04:38:35.689 --> 04:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
anymore you're not going to from now on
 
04:38:38.090 --> 04:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
you're gonna you're gonna you're not
 
04:38:40.670 --> 04:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
gonna take as long as you have taken to
 
04:38:42.230 --> 04:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
provide this information and the person
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
wins the court says yep you know the
 
04:38:46.189 --> 04:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
town really was
 
04:38:48.250 --> 04:38:48.260 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:38:51.590 --> 04:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
dragging their heels and and
 
04:38:54.109 --> 04:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
um so I'm so judgment is entered in
 
04:38:57.709 --> 04:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
favor of the requester but
 
04:39:00.170 --> 04:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
the requester didn't actually it had
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
already gotten the information without
 
04:39:04.429 --> 04:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit what happens then thank you
 
04:39:05.929 --> 04:39:05.939 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
04:39:05.939 --> 04:39:06.910 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
um

04:39:06.910 --> 04:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:10.250 --> 04:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
to me I think you're stretching it a
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
little bit too far right I mean to come
 
04:39:15.230 --> 04:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
up try to come up with an example I mean
 
04:39:17.150 --> 04:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
um in the case you're saying it it to me
 
04:39:20.330 --> 04:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like that lawsuit was
 
04:39:24.109 --> 04:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
necessary right I mean this person
 
04:39:26.330 --> 04:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
their their
 
04:39:28.490 --> 04:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
just doing a lawsuit just because they
 
04:39:30.349 --> 04:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
didn't like the process or something you
 
04:39:32.631 --> 04:39:32.641 align:start position:0%
know what I mean it's it's um they got
 
04:39:34.910 --> 04:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
they wanted information they they got
 
04:39:36.368 --> 04:39:36.378 align:start position:0%
the information
 
04:39:38.448 --> 04:39:38.458 align:start position:0%
that should be the end of it I would
 
04:39:40.750 --> 04:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
think I mean I don't know
 
04:39:43.208 --> 04:39:43.218 align:start position:0%
I mean you may be wrong
 
04:39:47.868 --> 04:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
yeah other questions for this Witness
 
04:39:49.490 --> 04:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
and may I I'd like to acknowledge my uh
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor representative Smith she she
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
is also helped us uh put this together
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
great thank you for sure
 
04:40:02.510 --> 04:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:40:02.520 --> 04:40:04.070 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:06.650 --> 04:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
now let's see uh so next
 
04:40:24.230 --> 04:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:27.650 --> 04:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
yes it's cocoa sorry I'm sorry thank you
 
04:40:29.030 --> 04:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
no it's fine
 
04:40:29.040 --> 04:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
no it's fine
um

04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:31.550 --> 04:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
so I'll jump right into it right to know
 
04:40:33.288 --> 04:40:33.298 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire enthusiastically supports
 
04:40:35.630 --> 04:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
HB 307 which sets a more realistic
 
04:40:37.368 --> 04:40:37.378 align:start position:0%
standard for awarding attorney's fees
 
04:40:39.230 --> 04:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
when right to know cases are won by the
 
04:40:39.240 --> 04:40:40.368 align:start position:0%
when right to know cases are won by the
requester

04:40:40.368 --> 04:40:40.378 align:start position:0%
requester
 
04:40:42.530 --> 04:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
unfortunately due to limitations of data
 
04:40:44.090 --> 04:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
that's available we're not able to
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
articulate the number of right to know
 
04:40:47.330 --> 04:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
cases that might have been fought how
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
many were won by the requester or the
 
04:40:50.750 --> 04:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
number of instances where the winner of
 
04:40:53.090 --> 04:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
the case was awarded attorney's fees I
 
04:40:54.530 --> 04:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
always prefer to have that kind of
 
04:40:56.270 --> 04:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
information on hand and right to know
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has tried to gather what
 
04:40:59.448 --> 04:40:59.458 align:start position:0%
it can from available court records but
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
with few findings what I can say is that
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
based on the experience of our
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
membership the general public who seeks
 
04:41:07.250 --> 04:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
our help and the attorneys with whom we
 
04:41:09.650 --> 04:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
interact an award of attorney's fees is
 
04:41:12.708 --> 04:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
incredibly rare not only that but in
 
04:41:14.448 --> 04:41:14.458 align:start position:0%
most cases municipalities and state
 
04:41:16.250 --> 04:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
agencies typically outlawyer and
 
04:41:18.170 --> 04:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
outspend the average citizen where there
 
04:41:19.670 --> 04:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
is a contested outcome and a right to
 
04:41:21.170 --> 04:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
know case
 
04:41:22.730 --> 04:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
the spending power and the knowledge
 
04:41:24.350 --> 04:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
base of the state and local governments
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
typically Edge out less powerful
 
04:41:27.770 --> 04:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
citizens forcing them into a position of
 
04:41:29.510 --> 04:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
deciding whether to pursue an
 
04:41:31.310 --> 04:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement action that may lead to a
 
04:41:34.610 --> 04:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
financial loss even when they win and
 
04:41:36.650 --> 04:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
even if they're able to do that a
 
04:41:38.868 --> 04:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
citizen who makes rational economic
 
04:41:41.510 --> 04:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
decisions and I admit that not all of us
 
04:41:43.970 --> 04:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
do that is unlikely to invest in an
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
action that does not confer a personal
 
04:41:48.470 --> 04:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
benefit the public good rarely outweighs
 
04:41:50.510 --> 04:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
a personal pocketbook the playing field
 
04:41:52.250 --> 04:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
needs to be evened out so the average
 
04:41:55.128 --> 04:41:55.138 align:start position:0%
citizen has a shot at coming out if not
 
04:41:57.050 --> 04:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
completely whole at least partially
 
04:41:58.850 --> 04:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
compensated for the public good that
 
04:42:01.070 --> 04:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
they are fighting for otherwise they're
 
04:42:02.690 --> 04:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
further disincentivized to raise the
 
04:42:03.948 --> 04:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
issue at all
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
if our current law didn't rely on
 
04:42:07.250 --> 04:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
private actions for enforcement maybe
 
04:42:09.050 --> 04:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
this strategy wouldn't be necessary but
 
04:42:11.208 --> 04:42:11.218 align:start position:0%
it does I think this Reliance on private
 
04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
action is one reason that New Hampshire
 
04:42:14.810 --> 04:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
ranked 34th in the nation and received a
 
04:42:17.090 --> 04:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
d-minus in public Integrity as evaluated
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
by the Center for Public Integrity in 19
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
in 2015 not 1915. in the category of
 
04:42:25.190 --> 04:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
public access to information New
 
04:42:28.010 --> 04:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire received an f and ranked 49th
 
04:42:29.930 --> 04:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
the report stated that the bar for
 
04:42:31.730 --> 04:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
recovering attorney's fees and other
 
04:42:34.368 --> 04:42:34.378 align:start position:0%
costs is dauntingly high here one
 
04:42:36.530 --> 04:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
related driver for that score was that
 
04:42:38.750 --> 04:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
in practice the entities to monitor the
 
04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
application of access to information
 
04:42:43.128 --> 04:42:43.138 align:start position:0%
laws independently are not initiating
 
04:42:45.170 --> 04:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
investigations or imposing penalties on
 
04:42:47.990 --> 04:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
offenders we got a score of zero
 
04:42:50.090 --> 04:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
in helping to create the right to know
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's office the Judiciary
 
04:42:53.930 --> 04:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
Committee has tacitly acknowledged the
 
04:42:55.730 --> 04:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
financial deterrent that prevents
 
04:42:57.288 --> 04:42:57.298 align:start position:0%
citizens from bringing their right to
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
know issues to court and I think that's
 
04:43:01.250 --> 04:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
very important but even the creation of
 
04:43:03.230 --> 04:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
this office will not change the scored
 
04:43:04.788 --> 04:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
factor that I just mentioned because
 
04:43:06.890 --> 04:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
investigations still have to be
 
04:43:09.230 --> 04:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
instigated by private action and
 
04:43:11.810 --> 04:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
existing penalties for violations of 91a
 
04:43:15.948 --> 04:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
are limited but HB 307 would make it
 
04:43:17.750 --> 04:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
more feasible for those who do find
 
04:43:19.550 --> 04:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
themselves in court to consider pursuing
 
04:43:20.990 --> 04:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
the right to know enforcement action
 
04:43:23.208 --> 04:43:23.218 align:start position:0%
since those actions take the place of
 
04:43:24.470 --> 04:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
independent monitoring in New Hampshire
 
04:43:26.030 --> 04:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
they're contributing to the public good
 
04:43:27.470 --> 04:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
and a healthy discourse around the
 
04:43:29.270 --> 04:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
implementation and enforcement of RSA
 
04:43:29.280 --> 04:43:30.830 align:start position:0%
implementation and enforcement of RSA
91a

04:43:30.830 --> 04:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
91a
 
04:43:33.050 --> 04:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
I'm going to preempt what I think I
 
04:43:34.910 --> 04:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
might hear in the opposition which is
 
04:43:36.410 --> 04:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
that public bodies do not want to have
 
04:43:38.448 --> 04:43:38.458 align:start position:0%
to pay costs associated with clarifying
 
04:43:40.970 --> 04:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
gray areas of the law unfortunately this
 
04:43:42.288 --> 04:43:42.298 align:start position:0%
works to the advantage of the public
 
04:43:44.690 --> 04:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
body as long as those gray areas exist
 
04:43:46.550 --> 04:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty they create is and will
 
04:43:48.170 --> 04:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
be exploited to the benefit of the more
 
04:43:50.448 --> 04:43:50.458 align:start position:0%
powerful public body and sometimes the
 
04:43:51.890 --> 04:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
only way to gain Clarity on those gray
 
04:43:53.690 --> 04:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
areas is to bring a challenge to the
 
04:43:55.610 --> 04:43:55.620 align:start position:0%
system that judicial clarification
 
04:43:57.530 --> 04:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
benefits the general public and I would
 
04:43:59.330 --> 04:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
argue that sometimes even when the right
 
04:44:01.610 --> 04:44:01.620 align:start position:0%
to no case is lost and I've lost some
 
04:44:03.890 --> 04:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
the clarification found in the case law
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
is a benefit to the General Public
 
04:44:08.510 --> 04:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
I can provide an example of that if we
 
04:44:10.330 --> 04:44:10.340 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about a gray area but
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
given the extremely high upfront costs
 
04:44:14.390 --> 04:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
that are associated with attorneys fees
 
04:44:16.128 --> 04:44:16.138 align:start position:0%
this legislation is not likely to
 
04:44:18.410 --> 04:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
precipitate frivolous actions what it
 
04:44:20.330 --> 04:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
will do is improve the chances that New
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens will be able to
 
04:44:23.448 --> 04:44:23.458 align:start position:0%
fulfill the role that's assigned to them
 
04:44:25.250 --> 04:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
as independent enforcers of New
 
04:44:26.990 --> 04:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's right to no law and
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
encourage them to pursue cases where
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
their position is obviously or very
 
04:44:33.708 --> 04:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
likely to result in a winning case and
 
04:44:37.070 --> 04:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
changes to the behavior of public bodies
 
04:44:37.080 --> 04:44:37.970 align:start position:0%
changes to the behavior of public bodies
um

04:44:37.970 --> 04:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:41.090 --> 04:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
and I will end there thank you
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:50.448 --> 04:44:50.458 align:start position:0%
so I guess I I do have a question the um
 
04:44:53.090 --> 04:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
you've you've removed from the current
 
04:44:53.100 --> 04:44:54.948 align:start position:0%
you've you've removed from the current
law

04:44:54.948 --> 04:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:44:57.770 --> 04:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
um language that says fee shall not be
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
awarded if the parties agree to that
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's taken out I
 
04:45:04.430 --> 04:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say you but that's taken out
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
of the language of the of the uh of the
 
04:45:11.690 --> 04:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
bill and so my question would be
 
04:45:11.700 --> 04:45:13.850 align:start position:0%
bill and so my question would be
um

04:45:13.850 --> 04:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:16.368 --> 04:45:16.378 align:start position:0%
I I
 
04:45:19.010 --> 04:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
would it be your understanding that even
 
04:45:22.970 --> 04:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
though that under the under the proposed
 
04:45:26.208 --> 04:45:26.218 align:start position:0%
uh bill with the Amendments that it
 
04:45:28.490 --> 04:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
accomplishes to current law
 
04:45:31.070 --> 04:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
there would nothing there would not be
 
04:45:34.490 --> 04:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
nothing that would prevent the parties
 
04:45:34.500 --> 04:45:35.810 align:start position:0%
nothing that would prevent the parties
to

04:45:35.810 --> 04:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:45:38.690 --> 04:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
a right to know litigation from agreeing
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
that in this particular case no fees
 
04:45:44.350 --> 04:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:46.670 --> 04:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:45:46.680 --> 04:45:47.448 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

04:45:47.448 --> 04:45:47.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:50.150 --> 04:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
I I will clarify this is not um
 
04:45:52.190 --> 04:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
legislation that right to know New
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire drafted so
 
04:45:56.750 --> 04:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I I'm weighing in based on my opinion
 
04:45:58.430 --> 04:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
and my read of this but I do not think
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
that this prevents any kind of agreement
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
from being able to take place that was
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
my reading aspect okay okay I'm sorry
 
04:46:07.070 --> 04:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
04:46:10.670 --> 04:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:13.250 --> 04:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh Lori
 
04:46:18.010 --> 04:46:18.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:21.170 --> 04:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
 
04:46:21.180 --> 04:46:22.850 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
foreign

04:46:22.850 --> 04:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Lori ortolano
 
04:46:27.470 --> 04:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
um I didn't come with anything prepared
 
04:46:30.350 --> 04:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
in writing just came to speak
 
04:46:32.150 --> 04:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm a member of right to know New
 
04:46:34.730 --> 04:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I speak in favor of this
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
bill as a member and also as an
 
04:46:39.050 --> 04:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
individual that's been involved in right
 
04:46:41.690 --> 04:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
to know litigation in Nashua
 
04:46:44.270 --> 04:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
for almost three years
 
04:46:44.280 --> 04:46:45.350 align:start position:0%
for almost three years
um

04:46:45.350 --> 04:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:47.390 --> 04:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
I think it's time
 
04:46:50.868 --> 04:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
to remove this standard that we have as
 
04:46:52.970 --> 04:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
part of the language and make it easier
 
04:46:56.090 --> 04:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
for attorneys fees to be accessible to
 
04:46:58.490 --> 04:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
people filing suits and I think it would
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
have helped me in my cases tremendously
 
04:47:04.310 --> 04:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
to come to resolution and close them
 
04:47:06.770 --> 04:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
down without having them spiral a lot of
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
control and become what I would call a
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
dumpster fire
 
04:47:09.840 --> 04:47:11.330 align:start position:0%
dumpster fire
and

04:47:11.330 --> 04:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:11.340 --> 04:47:12.550 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:47:12.550 --> 04:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:15.770 --> 04:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
the as it stands right now the cost of
 
04:47:18.410 --> 04:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
litigation is very high I took a right
 
04:47:20.570 --> 04:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
to no lawsuit into court for assessing
 
04:47:23.150 --> 04:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
records I spent two hundred and thirty
 
04:47:25.850 --> 04:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars I won a portion of my
 
04:47:29.330 --> 04:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
fees I removed my lawyer after I got
 
04:47:32.690 --> 04:47:32.700 align:start position:0%
through the order but the city appealed
 
04:47:34.970 --> 04:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court the cost of the
 
04:47:36.490 --> 04:47:36.500 align:start position:0%
appeal was going to be a hundred grand
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
so I went on my own and
 
04:47:43.250 --> 04:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
um you know it's hard to be a pro say
 
04:47:46.128 --> 04:47:46.138 align:start position:0%
litigant doing this but you know I filed
 
04:47:48.530 --> 04:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
a right to no lawsuit with an attorney
 
04:47:50.690 --> 04:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
under the assumption that they're
 
04:47:54.050 --> 04:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
handled you know a priority case they're
 
04:47:57.050 --> 04:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
simple I was told not a big deal I told
 
04:47:58.850 --> 04:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
my husband I'm gonna do this I'm
 
04:48:00.170 --> 04:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
frustrated I've been trying to get
 
04:48:01.550 --> 04:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
records for a year
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
and he was all on board
 
04:48:06.230 --> 04:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
but we had no idea it was going to be a
 
04:48:07.670 --> 04:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
quarter of a million dollars and if I'd
 
04:48:09.410 --> 04:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
stuck with it it would cost four hundred
 
04:48:13.250 --> 04:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
thousand we just had no idea and it's
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
frustrating to me that
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
um that's what I learned
 
04:48:21.530 --> 04:48:21.540 align:start position:0%
um I did two cases after the one with
 
04:48:22.910 --> 04:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
the attorney actually while the attorney
 
04:48:25.250 --> 04:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
was representing I filed two more on my
 
04:48:28.128 --> 04:48:28.138 align:start position:0%
own in Superior Court pro se
 
04:48:31.010 --> 04:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
and I won those cases and I did it to
 
04:48:32.510 --> 04:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
just I wasn't going to go through the
 
04:48:35.270 --> 04:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
legal fees I went through I won the
 
04:48:37.430 --> 04:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
ruling for the records and the city has
 
04:48:39.170 --> 04:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
appealed all three cases up to the
 
04:48:40.550 --> 04:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
04:48:44.448 --> 04:48:44.458 align:start position:0%
so they're challenging the the in the
 
04:48:46.010 --> 04:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
case represented by the attorney that
 
04:48:47.990 --> 04:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
was so expensive the court did award
 
04:48:50.810 --> 04:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
fees and he awarded information that the
 
04:48:52.788 --> 04:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
city would not provide
 
04:48:53.810 --> 04:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
um they're still withholding the
 
04:48:55.010 --> 04:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
information and they're fighting the
 
04:48:58.010 --> 04:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
fees I may not win these high standards
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
I may not win and they might be reversed
 
04:49:01.550 --> 04:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
and it's going to have cost me a quarter
 
04:49:04.850 --> 04:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
of a million dollars and it upsets me a
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
great deal that the constitution is
 
04:49:09.410 --> 04:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
written such that our records are
 
04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to be open accessible
 
04:49:12.590 --> 04:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
accountable and our government is
 
04:49:14.810 --> 04:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
supposed to be responsible and we're not
 
04:49:15.948 --> 04:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
supposed to have unreasonable
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
restrictions and you can't be a single
 
04:49:20.510 --> 04:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
digit millionaire and take these cases
 
04:49:22.730 --> 04:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
into court as a citizen anymore you
 
04:49:26.090 --> 04:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
can't your billing rates are 500 an hour
 
04:49:27.890 --> 04:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
and you're just being raked over the
 
04:49:29.690 --> 04:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
coals and municipalities have big
 
04:49:32.090 --> 04:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
pocketbooks with taxpayer dollars and
 
04:49:34.670 --> 04:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
they were able to fight me like a beast
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
I stayed in the game
 
04:49:39.948 --> 04:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
um but it's been really eye-opening and
 
04:49:42.170 --> 04:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
since those three cases are done I went
 
04:49:44.150 --> 04:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
in with another one because the city
 
04:49:46.670 --> 04:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
just won't shape up and I know that if I
 
04:49:48.350 --> 04:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
tried to get legal representation that
 
04:49:49.970 --> 04:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
case in Lower Court would cost me four
 
04:49:51.470 --> 04:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars with a lawyer
 
04:49:53.090 --> 04:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm not paying it
 
04:49:54.590 --> 04:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be the cost for
 
04:49:56.990 --> 04:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
information you know we've lost our
 
04:50:00.288 --> 04:50:00.298 align:start position:0%
media coverage now Nashua no longer has
 
04:50:02.570 --> 04:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
a newspaper really of any doesn't cover
 
04:50:04.850 --> 04:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
any political things Manchester is very
 
04:50:04.860 --> 04:50:05.990 align:start position:0%
any political things Manchester is very
minimal

04:50:05.990 --> 04:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
04:50:08.270 --> 04:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
the Press played a big role in right to
 
04:50:10.330 --> 04:50:10.340 align:start position:0%
know in opening records and taking place
 
04:50:14.270 --> 04:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
cases into court and that was great they
 
04:50:16.550 --> 04:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
had them Corporation behind them in the
 
04:50:18.708 --> 04:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
money but I think you're seeing it shift
 
04:50:21.708 --> 04:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
to Citizens trying to do it and we're
 
04:50:24.530 --> 04:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
getting smoked and our ability to win in
 
04:50:27.310 --> 04:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
court is pretty poor I think
 
04:50:30.230 --> 04:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
I feel like the courts don't like these
 
04:50:32.628 --> 04:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
cases they're burdensome to the court
 
04:50:34.430 --> 04:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
they're busy they have bigger fish to
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
fries they've got criminal cases we've
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
got drug problems we've got serious
 
04:50:40.250 --> 04:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
problems that have to be looked at and
 
04:50:42.170 --> 04:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
your little information request isn't
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
very important but it is because it it
 
04:50:47.330 --> 04:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
allows government to operate in the way
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
government is supposed to operate and
 
04:50:52.610 --> 04:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
when you make it so difficult for
 
04:50:54.890 --> 04:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
information to be obtained you have no
 
04:50:58.010 --> 04:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
press That's checking municipalities can
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
go really off the rails and there's no
 
04:51:02.570 --> 04:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
way to pull them back on
 
04:51:05.390 --> 04:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
I think that's happened in Nashua and it
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
is it is brutal and it becomes so
 
04:51:11.390 --> 04:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
personal it's not just a request for
 
04:51:12.948 --> 04:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
information it's the associated
 
04:51:15.410 --> 04:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
gaslighting of citizens that goes on in
 
04:51:16.730 --> 04:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
trying to get it
 
04:51:20.690 --> 04:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
and I think if fees were awarded the
 
04:51:22.550 --> 04:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
cities and the towns would sit back and
 
04:51:24.530 --> 04:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
go oh you know we don't want to play
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
games here we want to be clear we want
 
04:51:28.910 --> 04:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
to try and get to the bottom of this and
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't want to be paying fees
 
04:51:34.730 --> 04:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
and I I think it would have helped me
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not certain it would have fully
 
04:51:38.270 --> 04:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
helped me but I think it would have
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
definitely helped me and
 
04:51:42.830 --> 04:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:51:46.128 --> 04:51:46.138 align:start position:0%
sort of get control of the nonsense
 
04:51:46.138 --> 04:51:46.810 align:start position:0%
sort of get control of the nonsense
um

04:51:46.810 --> 04:51:46.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:50.030 --> 04:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
yeah these this was a really eye-opening
 
04:51:51.948 --> 04:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
experience to me for me and very very
 
04:51:55.730 --> 04:51:55.740 align:start position:0%
painful for my family and it goes on and
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
when they can appeal and go to the
 
04:51:59.690 --> 04:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I won't see responses and
 
04:52:03.590 --> 04:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
information until 2024 2025 and by the
 
04:52:04.850 --> 04:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
time I get them
 
04:52:08.390 --> 04:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's all a waste of time and I
 
04:52:11.208 --> 04:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
wasted you know hundreds of thousands of
 
04:52:13.910 --> 04:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
dollars to get really nothing
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
it's very disappointing I I wish the
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
state and the government and the courts
 
04:52:20.930 --> 04:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
I'm frustrated with the courts had done
 
04:52:23.570 --> 04:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
more to get a hold of this before it
 
04:52:26.030 --> 04:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
became this the Ombudsman office is
 
04:52:27.830 --> 04:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
terrific the work done
 
04:52:30.110 --> 04:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
by representative dilorenzo and right to
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire I think it's a great
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
move it's a step in the right direction
 
04:52:35.990 --> 04:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
but when you go into court and you need
 
04:52:38.750 --> 04:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
to access Court let's let's allow some
 
04:52:41.628 --> 04:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
of these fees to be obtained you're only
 
04:52:43.310 --> 04:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
going to win probably 30 percent of the
 
04:52:45.590 --> 04:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
time citizens aren't going to do great
 
04:52:45.600 --> 04:52:47.390 align:start position:0%
time citizens aren't going to do great
but

04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:52:49.970 --> 04:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
um you know give us an opportunity to
 
04:52:51.530 --> 04:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
recoup these the
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
very expensive thank you thank you
 
04:52:56.990 --> 04:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
questions for this Wednesday uh yes
 
04:52:59.150 --> 04:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative Brees thank you oh well
 
04:53:00.948 --> 04:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry okay sorry thank you Mr
 
04:53:02.690 --> 04:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
actually this may be a question for you
 
04:53:04.730 --> 04:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
and your legal expertise and you could
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
clarify for all of us
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
do we have the ability to restrict a
 
04:53:14.810 --> 04:53:14.820 align:start position:0%
public body from being able to appeal a
 
04:53:17.930 --> 04:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
decision unless some newly discovered
 
04:53:19.550 --> 04:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
evidence would show that the original
 
04:53:23.390 --> 04:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
ruling was unjust so to play The
 
04:53:25.788 --> 04:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
Stonewall and the expensive Stonewall of
 
04:53:27.170 --> 04:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
well we'll just appeal it because we've
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
got deeper pockets they can't do that
 
04:53:31.550 --> 04:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
unless there's some way they can prove
 
04:53:34.430 --> 04:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
that the original ruling was unjust
 
04:53:37.010 --> 04:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
by some new evidence can can we do that
 
04:53:38.810 --> 04:53:38.820 align:start position:0%
because the private citizen can appeal
 
04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
their decision against them that's out
 
04:53:43.368 --> 04:53:43.378 align:start position:0%
of their pocket but the public body is
 
04:53:45.470 --> 04:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
just playing a game
 
04:53:49.310 --> 04:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
I mean I I mean I I guess that we we
 
04:53:50.930 --> 04:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
probably could do that although I would
 
04:53:53.510 --> 04:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
I guess what I would say is I'm not I
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:00.770 --> 04:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
any time the the
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
anytime the municipality appeals I
 
04:54:06.410 --> 04:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
assume that
 
04:54:09.410 --> 04:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
somebody has made a determination that
 
04:54:11.690 --> 04:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
that the lower that the trial court
 
04:54:14.330 --> 04:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
decision was wrong I mean you know I
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:18.590 --> 04:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm being maybe I'm being too
 
04:54:21.050 --> 04:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
generous to to attorneys but I think
 
04:54:23.930 --> 04:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
that in a for example if an attorney
 
04:54:27.288 --> 04:54:27.298 align:start position:0%
where if an attorney knew that a case
 
04:54:30.110 --> 04:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
was that a case was sort of frivolous
 
04:54:32.390 --> 04:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
let's say and they would and was just
 
04:54:35.810 --> 04:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
taking an appeal for the purpose of of
 
04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
costing the other side money I I think
 
04:54:39.948 --> 04:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
that attorney would be subject to
 
04:54:42.288 --> 04:54:42.298 align:start position:0%
discipline uh under the under the rules
 
04:54:46.610 --> 04:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
of professional conduct so I I assume in
 
04:54:49.550 --> 04:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
you know in most cases that that
 
04:54:52.610 --> 04:54:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh some you know an attorney who
 
04:54:54.410 --> 04:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
representing the municipality has made a
 
04:54:57.110 --> 04:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
determination that we have some issues
 
04:54:59.570 --> 04:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
here that we have a reasonable chance of
 
04:55:01.190 --> 04:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
prevailing on not necessarily we're
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
going to win but but but it's not a
 
04:55:05.750 --> 04:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
frivolous kind of issue
 
04:55:08.090 --> 04:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
oh I hope that answers your question
 
04:55:10.490 --> 04:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
could I respond to that as well his
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
question just
 
04:55:12.480 --> 04:55:13.250 align:start position:0%
question just
um

04:55:13.250 --> 04:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:15.470 --> 04:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
from my perspective
 
04:55:15.480 --> 04:55:16.368 align:start position:0%
from my perspective
um

04:55:16.368 --> 04:55:16.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:17.990 --> 04:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know you hope they wouldn't do
 
04:55:20.208 --> 04:55:20.218 align:start position:0%
things frivolously but I think in fact
 
04:55:22.190 --> 04:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
in my situation there have been some
 
04:55:24.708 --> 04:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
frivolous things done and
 
04:55:26.750 --> 04:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Lynn is correct you
 
04:55:28.010 --> 04:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
know you can file a complaint through
 
04:55:30.050 --> 04:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
the professional conduct committee
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
but let me tell you how difficult that
 
04:55:32.400 --> 04:55:33.230 align:start position:0%
but let me tell you how difficult that
is

04:55:33.230 --> 04:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:55:35.448 --> 04:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
you can't get a lawyer to assist you
 
04:55:37.190 --> 04:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
because lawyers don't like writing out
 
04:55:39.590 --> 04:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
other lawyers and guess what the the
 
04:55:42.170 --> 04:55:42.180 align:start position:0%
city does they lawyer up
 
04:55:45.410 --> 04:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
and you go in there it's brutal your
 
04:55:48.170 --> 04:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
chances of getting through that group is
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
beyond discouraging I am A1 disgusted
 
04:55:53.330 --> 04:55:53.340 align:start position:0%
with what it takes to take a complaint
 
04:55:56.690 --> 04:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
to a professional conduct committee that
 
04:55:56.700 --> 04:55:57.410 align:start position:0%
to a professional conduct committee that
is

04:55:57.410 --> 04:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
and you're sworn they tell you you're
 
04:56:01.788 --> 04:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
sworn to confidentiality you don't sign
 
04:56:04.190 --> 04:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
any agreement there is no complaint I
 
04:56:07.550 --> 04:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
could file in any other group that I I
 
04:56:09.770 --> 04:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
as a citizen am not allowed to share
 
04:56:11.570 --> 04:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
that complaint if I file against
 
04:56:13.368 --> 04:56:13.378 align:start position:0%
assessors in the Department of Revenue
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's a public complaint it's all public
 
04:56:18.288 --> 04:56:18.298 align:start position:0%
they tell you it's all private so you're
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
just stuck in a hole with no
 
04:56:23.090 --> 04:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
representation and citizens can't write
 
04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
them well enough
 
04:56:27.350 --> 04:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
if they give you a book of like 10 point
 
04:56:30.770 --> 04:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
print with 200 rules to figure out which
 
04:56:33.050 --> 04:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
one they violated it's it's very
 
04:56:33.060 --> 04:56:34.490 align:start position:0%
one they violated it's it's very
difficult

04:56:34.490 --> 04:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
04:56:38.030 --> 04:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
you can't go up against it it's it's not
 
04:56:39.170 --> 04:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
a good system
 
04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo I believe you had
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
a question all right any other questions
 
04:56:45.170 --> 04:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
for this witness yes representative
 
04:56:48.170 --> 04:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you for taking my question
 
04:56:49.910 --> 04:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
see this seems very black and white to
 
04:56:52.190 --> 04:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
me remember I'm not a lawyer but you
 
04:56:54.770 --> 04:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
asked for paperwork you weren't given
 
04:56:57.770 --> 04:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:01.690 --> 04:57:01.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:05.270 --> 04:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
How can there be appeals to if the judge
 
04:57:08.030 --> 04:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
said you should have your paperwork
 
04:57:10.970 --> 04:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
if I I I'm naive in the legal system
 
04:57:14.208 --> 04:57:14.218 align:start position:0%
although so was I so was I but they have
 
04:57:16.070 --> 04:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
it right that's the process the judicial
 
04:57:18.350 --> 04:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
process they have a right to challenge
 
04:57:20.448 --> 04:57:20.458 align:start position:0%
the decision of the Court the lower
 
04:57:22.490 --> 04:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
court and they have an appeal process
 
04:57:24.770 --> 04:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
that takes it to a higher court so this
 
04:57:26.270 --> 04:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
was black and white I asked for
 
04:57:28.250 --> 04:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
something I didn't get it I'm going to
 
04:57:30.590 --> 04:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
court to get it right and then and
 
04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
what's even more frustrating in one set
 
04:57:35.810 --> 04:57:35.820 align:start position:0%
of Records I asked for a year and they
 
04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
they said they were giving them to me
 
04:57:39.050 --> 04:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
we're sending them we're redacting them
 
04:57:40.368 --> 04:57:40.378 align:start position:0%
we're looking at them we're sending them
 
04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
went on and on and on
 
04:57:45.350 --> 04:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
and then this was asked for in December
 
04:57:50.170 --> 04:57:50.180 align:start position:0%
of 2019 in October 30th of
 
04:57:53.150 --> 04:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
2020 the letter came that they elected
 
04:57:54.530 --> 04:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
to deny them
 
04:57:58.010 --> 04:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
so you wait 10 months and you're told no
 
04:57:59.990 --> 04:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
after they looked at them
 
04:58:02.448 --> 04:58:02.458 align:start position:0%
and and you know then you could get a
 
04:58:04.610 --> 04:58:04.620 align:start position:0%
ruling to win and they're up there
 
04:58:06.590 --> 04:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
appealing it
 
04:58:08.570 --> 04:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
you know it's just
 
04:58:10.310 --> 04:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's maddening
 
04:58:13.128 --> 04:58:13.138 align:start position:0%
I other questions uh representative
 
04:58:13.138 --> 04:58:15.368 align:start position:0%
I other questions uh representative
Smith

04:58:15.368 --> 04:58:15.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
it's so good to see you again thank you
 
04:58:23.150 --> 04:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
um the whole issue of attorneys fees is
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
a very complicated issue there are very
 
04:58:31.610 --> 04:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
few areas where attorney
 
04:58:35.230 --> 04:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
's fees are granted by the court
 
04:58:38.270 --> 04:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
when the uh
 
04:58:42.708 --> 04:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
when the client prevails we've seen it
 
04:58:46.970 --> 04:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
in the area of special education and it
 
04:58:50.090 --> 04:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
was in that area because there was a
 
04:58:51.830 --> 04:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
clear there is a question there is a
 
04:58:55.490 --> 04:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
question here I promise because
 
04:58:59.090 --> 04:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
um there is a clear pattern of school
 
04:59:03.830 --> 04:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
districts having attorneys whose Revenue
 
04:59:06.890 --> 04:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
came from saying regardless of the
 
04:59:10.550 --> 04:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
merits of the case saying do not Grant
 
04:59:14.030 --> 04:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
what has happened is we've been aware of
 
04:59:18.590 --> 04:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
that in the area of special education
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
for a long time but we have not been
 
04:59:22.250 --> 04:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
aware of it
 
04:59:27.350 --> 04:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:30.890 --> 04:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
this bill though has two provisions and
 
04:59:32.930 --> 04:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
I want to ask you about the second one
 
04:59:38.448 --> 04:59:38.458 align:start position:0%
the first is if the requester prevails
 
04:59:41.448 --> 04:59:41.458 align:start position:0%
the court can then go and Grant
 
04:59:43.610 --> 04:59:43.620 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees
 
04:59:48.288 --> 04:59:48.298 align:start position:0%
but the next paragraph says if the
 
04:59:52.010 --> 04:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.150 --> 04:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
the court can then require them
 
04:59:59.208 --> 04:59:59.218 align:start position:0%
to meet the attorney's fees
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
of um of the agency
 
05:00:02.638 --> 05:00:05.868 align:start position:0%
of um of the agency
uh

05:00:05.868 --> 05:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:07.730 --> 05:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
do you see I think I think it's a little
 
05:00:09.830 --> 05:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
bit more restrictive
 
05:00:12.650 --> 05:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
um I think it has to show
 
05:00:12.660 --> 05:00:13.490 align:start position:0%
um I think it has to show
um

05:00:13.490 --> 05:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:15.948 --> 05:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
like the language now for Citizens I
 
05:00:19.610 --> 05:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
think it has to show an intent to to
 
05:00:22.070 --> 05:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
um try it out
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
um be malicious or unintendent not just
 
05:00:29.208 --> 05:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
um a favorable ruling against the
 
05:00:31.310 --> 05:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
citizen automatically grants the fees to
 
05:00:33.170 --> 05:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
the city the other thing is it would
 
05:00:35.270 --> 05:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
change because the cities would have to
 
05:00:38.030 --> 05:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
start keeping fee records and they don't
 
05:00:40.850 --> 05:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
the cities I'm required to hire an
 
05:00:43.030 --> 05:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
attorney who maintains contemporary
 
05:00:45.948 --> 05:00:45.958 align:start position:0%
contemporaneous records of their fees
 
05:00:48.770 --> 05:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
the city it does not maintain any fee
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
records at all
 
05:00:52.670 --> 05:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
and so I've been opposed to that because
 
05:00:55.190 --> 05:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
I think they ought to track them it
 
05:00:56.510 --> 05:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just be us
 
05:00:58.128 --> 05:00:58.138 align:start position:0%
that they can throw out a lot of things
 
05:00:59.930 --> 05:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
and stand in a meeting and say God that
 
05:01:01.730 --> 05:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
lady's made us waste millions of dollars
 
05:01:04.430 --> 05:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
show me the records but they don't track
 
05:01:07.010 --> 05:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
them at all if I could follow up what it
 
05:01:09.530 --> 05:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
says is in bad faith frivolous unjust
 
05:01:12.650 --> 05:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
the vexatious wanton or oppressive those
 
05:01:15.410 --> 05:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
are all very unpleasant terms but
 
05:01:18.830 --> 05:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
they're also as both specific and vague
 
05:01:22.368 --> 05:01:22.378 align:start position:0%
in terms of of definition
 
05:01:27.650 --> 05:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
um and so do you have any problem with
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
that section being included
 
05:01:32.270 --> 05:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
no because I do think those words in
 
05:01:34.550 --> 05:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
front of it put a higher standard than
 
05:01:38.090 --> 05:01:38.100 align:start position:0%
just losing and I also think those words
 
05:01:39.770 --> 05:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
are vague but there are legal
 
05:01:41.570 --> 05:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
definitions to them and they have to
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
abide by a legal definition and a legal
 
05:01:44.400 --> 05:01:46.850 align:start position:0%
abide by a legal definition and a legal
standard

05:01:46.850 --> 05:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:50.030 --> 05:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative yes I I just dawned
 
05:01:51.650 --> 05:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
on me as you were asked as that question
 
05:01:52.970 --> 05:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
is being asked and I guess I'll direct
 
05:01:56.510 --> 05:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
it at you but it may be maybe more
 
05:01:58.250 --> 05:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
easily answered
 
05:01:58.260 --> 05:01:59.030 align:start position:0%
easily answered
um

05:01:59.030 --> 05:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh buyer chairman
 
05:02:04.368 --> 05:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
if a lawsuit is one of those things uh
 
05:02:07.550 --> 05:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
frivolous or unjust or vexatious would
 
05:02:09.890 --> 05:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
it be dismissed
 
05:02:12.890 --> 05:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
and would that dismissal
 
05:02:14.570 --> 05:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
be different than rendering a final
 
05:02:14.580 --> 05:02:16.730 align:start position:0%
be different than rendering a final
judgment

05:02:16.730 --> 05:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
05:02:16.740 --> 05:02:18.890 align:start position:0%
judgment
uh

05:02:18.890 --> 05:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:02:20.510 --> 05:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
well I mean you said you're asking you
 
05:02:23.448 --> 05:02:23.458 align:start position:0%
to you're asking it of me but uh that's
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
a hard question for me to answer I mean
 
05:02:28.850 --> 05:02:28.860 align:start position:0%
I think that one way or another a judge
 
05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
has to make a ruling it might be part of
 
05:02:32.810 --> 05:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
a case that you submit a pleading on
 
05:02:34.670 --> 05:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to look at versus the
 
05:02:37.368 --> 05:02:37.378 align:start position:0%
whole thing I think it doesn't it
 
05:02:38.990 --> 05:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
probably would be hard for a judge to
 
05:02:41.208 --> 05:02:41.218 align:start position:0%
dismiss it without hearing it the case
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
in its entirety you're looking at all
 
05:02:45.230 --> 05:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
the evidence that's being
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
um you know provided so in that case
 
05:02:50.510 --> 05:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
time gets wasted potentially and that's
 
05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
what makes it you know a problem and
 
05:02:54.410 --> 05:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
frivolous but so I'm not certain that
 
05:02:56.930 --> 05:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
they can that they would or do or that I
 
05:02:58.850 --> 05:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
see often where they just a judge just
 
05:03:02.628 --> 05:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
dismisses something as frivolous they in
 
05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
my opinion are investing a good bit of
 
05:03:06.170 --> 05:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
their own time and effort and the
 
05:03:09.230 --> 05:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
resources of the court to determine that
 
05:03:12.110 --> 05:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness thank
 
05:03:15.530 --> 05:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:26.170 --> 05:03:26.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:28.910 --> 05:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon hi my name is Brendan
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
McQuaid I'm the president and publisher
 
05:03:31.610 --> 05:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire union leader I
 
05:03:32.810 --> 05:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
would like to start with disagreeing
 
05:03:34.730 --> 05:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
with Miss ortolano that the media is
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
gone we're very much here
 
05:03:38.330 --> 05:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm here representing the New
 
05:03:40.490 --> 05:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire press Association and we
 
05:03:43.190 --> 05:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
support HB 307
 
05:03:46.368 --> 05:03:46.378 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire right to no law as
 
05:03:48.350 --> 05:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
you know plays a crucial role in the
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
transparency of state and local
 
05:03:50.638 --> 05:03:51.890 align:start position:0%
transparency of state and local
government

05:03:51.890 --> 05:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
the log currently supports broad
 
05:03:56.448 --> 05:03:56.458 align:start position:0%
disclosure of documents but we continue
 
05:04:00.530 --> 05:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
to see instances like in Lori ortolano's
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
case where documents are wrongfully
 
05:04:05.208 --> 05:04:05.218 align:start position:0%
withheld and they're withheld in
 
05:04:06.770 --> 05:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
violation of the letter and the spirit
 
05:04:09.530 --> 05:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
of the law the current provision for
 
05:04:11.990 --> 05:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
awarding attorneys fees is that the
 
05:04:14.628 --> 05:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
public body public agency or person knew
 
05:04:16.190 --> 05:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
or should have known that the conduct
 
05:04:19.610 --> 05:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
engaged in was in violation
 
05:04:24.530 --> 05:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
we would expect that public agencies and
 
05:04:27.890 --> 05:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
public officials should have known that
 
05:04:31.430 --> 05:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
they were in violation uh in practice it
 
05:04:34.250 --> 05:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
proves to be a rather High bar and HB
 
05:04:36.470 --> 05:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
307 as proposed gives much more leeway
 
05:04:39.230 --> 05:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
for the court to award attorneys fees
 
05:04:42.050 --> 05:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
which have to be reasonable according to
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
the language
 
05:04:43.920 --> 05:04:44.570 align:start position:0%
the language
um

05:04:44.570 --> 05:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:45.830 --> 05:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
and it would create a financial
 
05:04:47.628 --> 05:04:47.638 align:start position:0%
incentive for public bodies to be more
 
05:04:49.970 --> 05:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
responsive to valid requests for
 
05:04:52.190 --> 05:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
information that they
 
05:04:54.050 --> 05:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
ought to know that the public has a
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
right to
 
05:04:56.570 --> 05:04:56.580 align:start position:0%

bit more attainable HB 307 will help
 
05:05:34.368 --> 05:05:34.378 align:start position:0%
level the playing field in the important
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
work that our members do we
 
05:05:39.530 --> 05:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support HP 307
 
05:05:41.628 --> 05:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh questions for
 
05:05:43.788 --> 05:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
05:05:47.448 --> 05:05:47.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:01.970 --> 05:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:03.890 --> 05:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Margaret burns with
 
05:06:05.448 --> 05:06:05.458 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
05:06:07.490 --> 05:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
and we are here this afternoon in
 
05:06:10.010 --> 05:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 307.
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
under our legal system the general rule
 
05:06:14.270 --> 05:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
is that parties to litigation pay their
 
05:06:16.670 --> 05:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
own fees and costs there are some
 
05:06:19.070 --> 05:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
exceptions to this Rule and the current
 
05:06:23.150 --> 05:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a8 is one of those exceptions
 
05:06:25.610 --> 05:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff or the requester is
 
05:06:27.708 --> 05:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
entitled to fees and costs if the
 
05:06:29.510 --> 05:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is necessary to enforce
 
05:06:31.550 --> 05:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
compliance with the right to know law
 
05:06:34.010 --> 05:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
or to address an intentional violation
 
05:06:35.810 --> 05:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
of the right to know law
 
05:06:38.628 --> 05:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
fees are awarded only if the Violator
 
05:06:40.368 --> 05:06:40.378 align:start position:0%
knew or should have known that the
 
05:06:43.310 --> 05:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
conduct was a violation of the law there
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
is logic to having these exceptions
 
05:06:48.650 --> 05:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
where there are intention intentional or
 
05:06:50.570 --> 05:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
egregious conduct that justifies
 
05:06:52.850 --> 05:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
awarding attorney's fees and costs to
 
05:06:55.970 --> 05:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
requesters or plaintiffs in these cases
 
05:06:57.770 --> 05:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
but under the bill the law would say
 
05:06:59.750 --> 05:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
that if a plaintiff is successful in a
 
05:07:02.208 --> 05:07:02.218 align:start position:0%
right to no law case and the lawsuit was
 
05:07:04.610 --> 05:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
quote necessary to enforce compliance
 
05:07:07.070 --> 05:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff will get fees and costs
 
05:07:09.650 --> 05:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
making this a dramatic change to the
 
05:07:11.150 --> 05:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
right to know law
 
05:07:13.670 --> 05:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
this would apply even in a situation
 
05:07:16.930 --> 05:07:16.940 align:start position:0%
where a public body or a public agency
 
05:07:19.970 --> 05:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
took reasonable steps to get legal
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
advice acted on that legal advice was
 
05:07:26.330 --> 05:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
sued and ultimately the plaintiff or the
 
05:07:28.910 --> 05:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
requester was successful
 
05:07:31.070 --> 05:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
Shifting the burden of Defending that
 
05:07:33.288 --> 05:07:33.298 align:start position:0%
lawsuit based on reasonable legal advice
 
05:07:35.270 --> 05:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayers
 
05:07:37.610 --> 05:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
the second section of the bill does
 
05:07:40.670 --> 05:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
allow the public body or the agency to
 
05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
receive attorney's fees and costs in
 
05:07:45.288 --> 05:07:45.298 align:start position:0%
certain situations where the lawsuit is
 
05:07:47.750 --> 05:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
vexatious frivolous and other terms that
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
are listed in the bill
 
05:07:51.770 --> 05:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
nhma does not support this section
 
05:07:54.890 --> 05:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
either we do not have a policy to seek
 
05:07:57.050 --> 05:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
out attorney's fees or costs from
 
05:07:59.150 --> 05:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
residents or citizens who bring right to
 
05:08:02.030 --> 05:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
no law cases our legislative policies
 
05:08:03.890 --> 05:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
with ex with respect to the right to
 
05:08:05.990 --> 05:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
know law are to oppose additional
 
05:08:08.330 --> 05:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
burdens and to support the intent and
 
05:08:10.730 --> 05:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
purpose of the law as well as to support
 
05:08:13.490 --> 05:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
legislation that clarifies the law and
 
05:08:15.050 --> 05:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
makes compliance and Public Access
 
05:08:17.690 --> 05:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
requirements easier and less burdensome
 
05:08:20.690 --> 05:08:20.700 align:start position:0%
for public officials and employees and
 
05:08:22.970 --> 05:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
less costly for taxpayers
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature has recently taken
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
significant action in this area to make
 
05:08:30.590 --> 05:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
right to no law actions more cost
 
05:08:32.510 --> 05:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
effective and more accessible to
 
05:08:34.730 --> 05:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
Residents and citizens with the creation
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
of the Ombudsman position
 
05:08:39.650 --> 05:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we are opposed to this
 
05:08:41.690 --> 05:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
bill and we would ask the committee to
 
05:08:44.090 --> 05:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
vote as an expedient to legislate thank
 
05:08:45.708 --> 05:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you questions for
 
05:08:48.410 --> 05:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:50.330 --> 05:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:08:51.770 --> 05:08:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:08:54.050 --> 05:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
your testimony so if I understand your
 
05:08:58.190 --> 05:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
your testimony in the in paragraph two
 
05:09:02.030 --> 05:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
the addition of the clause and provided
 
05:09:03.708 --> 05:09:03.718 align:start position:0%
that the court renders a final judgment
 
05:09:05.570 --> 05:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
against the requester
 
05:09:07.730 --> 05:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
you don't think that needs to be in
 
05:09:09.830 --> 05:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
there because current law ends with the
 
05:09:12.230 --> 05:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
period after oppressive
 
05:09:14.330 --> 05:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
no our position is that current law
 
05:09:18.830 --> 05:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
should remain in RSA 91a8 as written
 
05:09:20.270 --> 05:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
right so
 
05:09:22.850 --> 05:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
put a period after the word oppressive
 
05:09:25.010 --> 05:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
not have the what's bold that's correct
 
05:09:26.690 --> 05:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
that's where the period is thank you
 
05:09:28.368 --> 05:09:28.378 align:start position:0%
sorry for that for not being clear thank
 
05:09:28.378 --> 05:09:29.510 align:start position:0%
sorry for that for not being clear thank
you

05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:09:32.390 --> 05:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
05:09:35.750 --> 05:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Mr uh good
 
05:09:38.030 --> 05:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon Miss Burns um
 
05:09:39.470 --> 05:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
listening to to the testimony
 
05:09:45.530 --> 05:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
in this hearing I feel like
 
05:09:48.170 --> 05:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
you know there are two opposite poles
 
05:09:51.170 --> 05:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
kind of going back and forth is there a
 
05:09:53.628 --> 05:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
middle for instance you know if um the
 
05:09:55.610 --> 05:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
plaintiff files in court can the Judge
 
05:09:55.620 --> 05:09:56.390 align:start position:0%
plaintiff files in court can the Judge
order

05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
order
 
05:09:56.400 --> 05:09:57.650 align:start position:0%
order
um

05:09:57.650 --> 05:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:00.590 --> 05:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
an injunction Aristotle or something
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
like that so it doesn't get to that
 
05:10:06.770 --> 05:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
point where I believe it's RSA 91 A7 a
 
05:10:08.090 --> 05:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
different section from what we're
 
05:10:10.490 --> 05:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
dealing with now that does allow for an
 
05:10:12.288 --> 05:10:12.298 align:start position:0%
injunction so it's we're not always
 
05:10:13.970 --> 05:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:10:16.368 --> 05:10:16.378 align:start position:0%
um in we're not always talking about a
 
05:10:18.590 --> 05:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
specific scenario as as was referenced
 
05:10:20.208 --> 05:10:20.218 align:start position:0%
earlier about the records or not the
 
05:10:22.128 --> 05:10:22.138 align:start position:0%
records sometimes there's an injunction
 
05:10:24.530 --> 05:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
not to repeat this conduct in the future
 
05:10:26.750 --> 05:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a requirement even
 
05:10:28.550 --> 05:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
that the public body members undergo
 
05:10:30.530 --> 05:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
right to no law training so those are
 
05:10:32.570 --> 05:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
different types of orders
 
05:10:33.890 --> 05:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
um that you can see in these types of
 
05:10:33.900 --> 05:10:35.090 align:start position:0%
um that you can see in these types of
cases

05:10:35.090 --> 05:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
cases
 
05:10:37.550 --> 05:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
05:10:39.530 --> 05:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
witness say none thank you very much
 
05:10:42.350 --> 05:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:14.050 --> 05:11:14.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman your honor it's
 
05:11:19.128 --> 05:11:19.138 align:start position:0%
good to see everyone again uh today my
 
05:11:21.170 --> 05:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
name is Jill Bissonnet I represent the
 
05:11:22.730 --> 05:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
ACLU of New Hampshire we're here
 
05:11:24.708 --> 05:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
strongly in support
 
05:11:26.030 --> 05:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
um at this bill
 
05:11:28.128 --> 05:11:28.138 align:start position:0%
um I've been doing this job now for
 
05:11:30.470 --> 05:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
around 10 years and a core component of
 
05:11:31.430 --> 05:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
my work has always been government
 
05:11:34.128 --> 05:11:34.138 align:start position:0%
accountability public records work to
 
05:11:35.510 --> 05:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
try to make sure that the public has
 
05:11:37.490 --> 05:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
access to what their government
 
05:11:40.730 --> 05:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
officials are up to and it's frankly
 
05:11:43.910 --> 05:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
been among the many things I do probably
 
05:11:46.270 --> 05:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
the most rewarding work
 
05:11:49.250 --> 05:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
in my in my legal practice and just by
 
05:11:51.050 --> 05:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
virtue of that experience I am asked a
 
05:11:52.670 --> 05:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
lot by Advocates who cares much about
 
05:11:52.680 --> 05:11:54.770 align:start position:0%
lot by Advocates who cares much about
transparency

05:11:54.770 --> 05:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
05:11:57.230 --> 05:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
um as I do you know what would be
 
05:11:59.270 --> 05:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
like the the single greatest thing you
 
05:12:00.530 --> 05:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
could do to make New Hampshire more
 
05:12:04.670 --> 05:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
transparent and my response has been you
 
05:12:06.530 --> 05:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
know absent a wholesale rewrite of the
 
05:12:08.510 --> 05:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
statute which is hard and cumbersome and
 
05:12:10.850 --> 05:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
requires so many stakeholders
 
05:12:12.708 --> 05:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
it would be to have mandatory fee
 
05:12:14.208 --> 05:12:14.218 align:start position:0%
shifting it would be to do what this
 
05:12:18.350 --> 05:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
bill does and I want to explain why
 
05:12:18.360 --> 05:12:19.250 align:start position:0%
bill does and I want to explain why
um

05:12:19.250 --> 05:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:21.050 --> 05:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
mandatory fee shifting it allows
 
05:12:23.690 --> 05:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
requesters again who who Prevail in
 
05:12:25.310 --> 05:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
public records lawsuits to recover
 
05:12:27.170 --> 05:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees and costs and it is
 
05:12:27.180 --> 05:12:28.368 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees and costs and it is
critical

05:12:28.368 --> 05:12:28.378 align:start position:0%
critical
 
05:12:30.288 --> 05:12:30.298 align:start position:0%
to ensure the Public's right of access
 
05:12:34.430 --> 05:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
because it what it really does is create
 
05:12:37.070 --> 05:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
a set of incentives where government
 
05:12:39.350 --> 05:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
actors are more likely to produce
 
05:12:42.350 --> 05:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
records they are more likely to err on
 
05:12:44.208 --> 05:12:44.218 align:start position:0%
the side of disclosure and that is the
 
05:12:46.550 --> 05:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
whole point of chapter 91a
 
05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
chapter 91a creates a presumption in
 
05:12:51.650 --> 05:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
favor of disclosure that is to say the
 
05:12:54.170 --> 05:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
scales are already tipped
 
05:12:57.770 --> 05:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
but we operate in a system now where
 
05:13:00.770 --> 05:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
um you know I I work with Municipal
 
05:13:02.270 --> 05:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
lawyers they're great but they're very
 
05:13:03.890 --> 05:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
talented you know they know all the
 
05:13:05.810 --> 05:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
exemptions they can raise exemptions and
 
05:13:07.670 --> 05:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's no disincentive to just forcing
 
05:13:09.590 --> 05:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
a requester to go to court
 
05:13:11.628 --> 05:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
for the ACLU I mean we you know have
 
05:13:13.368 --> 05:13:13.378 align:start position:0%
more resources right we're able to say
 
05:13:14.868 --> 05:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
no we think you're wrong and we can file
 
05:13:18.050 --> 05:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
the 280 filing fee spend you know the
 
05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
tens maybe even hundreds of hours doing
 
05:13:19.798 --> 05:13:21.110 align:start position:0%
tens maybe even hundreds of hours doing
it

05:13:21.110 --> 05:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:13:22.670 --> 05:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
um because that's our job that's what
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
we're paid to do
 
05:13:25.868 --> 05:13:25.878 align:start position:0%
other people don't have that benefit
 
05:13:29.390 --> 05:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
Miss ortolano who you heard from doesn't
 
05:13:31.550 --> 05:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
have that benefit
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
and that I think is why we really do
 
05:13:35.448 --> 05:13:35.458 align:start position:0%
need to change this law and I really
 
05:13:38.750 --> 05:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
hope this committee considers
 
05:13:40.430 --> 05:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
um considers this change because chapter
 
05:13:43.430 --> 05:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
91a isn't an exemption law even though
 
05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
there are many exemptions in the statute
 
05:13:48.650 --> 05:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
it is a transparency law that every
 
05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
government body that gets a request
 
05:13:53.510 --> 05:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
should start from that default position
 
05:13:55.730 --> 05:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
and I fear that we have kind of gone in
 
05:13:57.948 --> 05:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
another Direction and I think this will
 
05:14:01.368 --> 05:14:01.378 align:start position:0%
reverse that particular trend
 
05:14:03.170 --> 05:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
mandatory fee shifting is important
 
05:14:05.030 --> 05:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
because when a requester successfully
 
05:14:06.770 --> 05:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
goes to court the requester has brought
 
05:14:09.110 --> 05:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit that confers a social good not
 
05:14:10.970 --> 05:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
just for that particular person but for
 
05:14:13.788 --> 05:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
the community at Large
 
05:14:16.610 --> 05:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
but without mandatory fee shifting a
 
05:14:18.170 --> 05:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
member of the public
 
05:14:20.628 --> 05:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
like Miss ortolano like anyone else who
 
05:14:22.128 --> 05:14:22.138 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to hire a
 
05:14:22.138 --> 05:14:23.030 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to hire a
lawyer

05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
05:14:25.368 --> 05:14:25.378 align:start position:0%
they're left to weigh the relative value
 
05:14:27.288 --> 05:14:27.298 align:start position:0%
of the requested records against the
 
05:14:29.390 --> 05:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
cost of litigation
 
05:14:32.150 --> 05:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
the result is a of this calculus is that
 
05:14:33.890 --> 05:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
many successful lawsuits frankly to
 
05:14:35.990 --> 05:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
remedy a government's violation may not
 
05:14:37.128 --> 05:14:37.138 align:start position:0%
be brought particularly when you're
 
05:14:38.750 --> 05:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with prosely litigants who know
 
05:14:41.810 --> 05:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
they're going to be faced with a
 
05:14:44.570 --> 05:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
municipality that has lawyers on
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
retainer so the result is those lawsuits
 
05:14:48.350 --> 05:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
aren't brought
 
05:14:50.990 --> 05:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
the public loses out on important
 
05:14:51.000 --> 05:14:52.970 align:start position:0%
the public loses out on important
information

05:14:52.970 --> 05:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:14:55.128 --> 05:14:55.138 align:start position:0%
so again I think when you so when we
 
05:14:57.410 --> 05:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
switch that balance when we create
 
05:14:59.810 --> 05:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
mandatory fee shifting now a government
 
05:15:01.970 --> 05:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
body needs to think well if I get if I
 
05:15:04.368 --> 05:15:04.378 align:start position:0%
get sued and lose I'm going to have to
 
05:15:05.930 --> 05:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
pay fees so I think they are going to be
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
more likely and more inclined to produce
 
05:15:10.368 --> 05:15:10.378 align:start position:0%
the particular information and in fact
 
05:15:12.590 --> 05:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
some some evidence bears that out and
 
05:15:15.890 --> 05:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
I've cited that in our testimony in
 
05:15:18.288 --> 05:15:18.298 align:start position:0%
states that do not have similar fee
 
05:15:19.610 --> 05:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
shifting Provisions in their public
 
05:15:21.288 --> 05:15:21.298 align:start position:0%
records laws the financial risk of
 
05:15:23.030 --> 05:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
litigation is often deterrent to
 
05:15:25.788 --> 05:15:25.798 align:start position:0%
requesters footnote 2 has some data on
 
05:15:28.788 --> 05:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
that and agencies in states with
 
05:15:30.530 --> 05:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
mandatory fee shifting Provisions tend
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate better compliance with
 
05:15:34.788 --> 05:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
public records laws as one study has
 
05:15:37.128 --> 05:15:37.138 align:start position:0%
found findings indicate that states with
 
05:15:38.868 --> 05:15:38.878 align:start position:0%
higher public records
 
05:15:41.030 --> 05:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
public records request compliance
 
05:15:43.190 --> 05:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
include mandatory attorney fee shifting
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
Provisions in their state laws so that
 
05:15:46.670 --> 05:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
is really the goal here
 
05:15:49.010 --> 05:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
I do I do want to note that we actually
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
used to have this in New Hampshire law
 
05:15:52.730 --> 05:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
believe it or not
 
05:15:54.470 --> 05:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
um we had mandatory fee shifting in New
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by virtue of an amendment to
 
05:15:59.628 --> 05:15:59.638 align:start position:0%
our public records law back in 1973.
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
it was then modified in 1977 and then in
 
05:16:07.250 --> 05:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
1986 we landed in the regime that we
 
05:16:08.868 --> 05:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
have now which is that you only get
 
05:16:10.910 --> 05:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees unless the government
 
05:16:13.850 --> 05:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
body knew or should have known so I do
 
05:16:15.650 --> 05:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate that there is there is
 
05:16:17.510 --> 05:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
precedent here in New Hampshire for this
 
05:16:19.368 --> 05:16:19.378 align:start position:0%
and frankly I think we have now endured
 
05:16:21.288 --> 05:16:21.298 align:start position:0%
a 30 plus year experiment
 
05:16:23.810 --> 05:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
with this attorney fee regime and I just
 
05:16:26.150 --> 05:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
don't think it's been successful
 
05:16:28.850 --> 05:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
but when we did have this uh this
 
05:16:30.530 --> 05:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
language this this mandatory fee
 
05:16:33.170 --> 05:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
shifting back in the in the 70s the
 
05:16:35.090 --> 05:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court uh said something that I
 
05:16:36.530 --> 05:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
think is pretty cool and I just think it
 
05:16:39.230 --> 05:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
really embodies why we need this again
 
05:16:40.970 --> 05:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire law and this is a case
 
05:16:44.090 --> 05:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
from 1976 called Bradbury versus Shaw
 
05:16:46.128 --> 05:16:46.138 align:start position:0%
I'm just I I hate to just quote things
 
05:16:48.050 --> 05:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
at length but to me it is very powerful
 
05:16:49.670 --> 05:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
and demonstrates why I think this is a
 
05:16:50.930 --> 05:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
good bill
 
05:16:52.730 --> 05:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
the provision for Award of attorney
 
05:16:54.530 --> 05:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
speech is critical to securing the
 
05:16:57.350 --> 05:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
rights guaranteed by the statute without
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
this provision the statute would often
 
05:17:00.890 --> 05:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
be a dead letter for the cost of
 
05:17:02.570 --> 05:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
enforcing compliance would generally
 
05:17:05.448 --> 05:17:05.458 align:start position:0%
exceed the value of the benefit gained
 
05:17:07.250 --> 05:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
in some cases the plaintiff May gain a
 
05:17:09.230 --> 05:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
financial benefit by the invalidation of
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
government action taken in violation of
 
05:17:12.890 --> 05:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
the statute but it will frequently be
 
05:17:14.990 --> 05:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
impossible to place a monetary value on
 
05:17:16.670 --> 05:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
the interests protected
 
05:17:18.770 --> 05:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
by the right to no law the attorney fee
 
05:17:21.770 --> 05:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
provision was enacted in this case 1973
 
05:17:23.570 --> 05:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
so that the Public's right to know would
 
05:17:25.490 --> 05:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
not depend on the ability of individuals
 
05:17:28.310 --> 05:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
to finance litigation
 
05:17:31.010 --> 05:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
and we lost that in the 80s and again I
 
05:17:33.530 --> 05:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
would submit that we need to get back to
 
05:17:34.670 --> 05:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
that there have been some questions
 
05:17:37.670 --> 05:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
about just um some of the language I
 
05:17:38.990 --> 05:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
know you had an excellent question your
 
05:17:41.930 --> 05:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
honor about absent a final judgment but
 
05:17:44.448 --> 05:17:44.458 align:start position:0%
if a lawsuit compelled information to be
 
05:17:47.030 --> 05:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
produced would there still be a
 
05:17:48.530 --> 05:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
requirement for attorney's fees and I
 
05:17:49.970 --> 05:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
don't think so this language actually
 
05:17:51.830 --> 05:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
deliberately does not use the Catalyst
 
05:17:54.590 --> 05:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
Theory so the Catalyst theory is if you
 
05:17:56.810 --> 05:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
file a lawsuit and it compels the
 
05:17:58.550 --> 05:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
government to produce something but you
 
05:18:00.350 --> 05:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
don't yet have a final judgment and some
 
05:18:01.550 --> 05:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions you may be able to get
 
05:18:04.250 --> 05:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees not here you need to you
 
05:18:07.010 --> 05:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
need to go that extra step and get a
 
05:18:08.628 --> 05:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
final judgment so if you file a lawsuit
 
05:18:10.250 --> 05:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
if you spend twenty thousand dollars
 
05:18:12.530 --> 05:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
filing a lawsuit and the government then
 
05:18:14.390 --> 05:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
decides to produce it you are out of
 
05:18:16.368 --> 05:18:16.378 align:start position:0%
luck I actually don't think that's ideal
 
05:18:18.230 --> 05:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
but there's discussion about a middle
 
05:18:20.208 --> 05:18:20.218 align:start position:0%
ground I actually think this is a middle
 
05:18:23.390 --> 05:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
ground because one potential proposal
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
here would be to omit the Judgment
 
05:18:28.128 --> 05:18:28.138 align:start position:0%
requirement altogether right
 
05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
um but here that exists and I think that
 
05:18:34.250 --> 05:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
that is a a middle ground position uh in
 
05:18:35.628 --> 05:18:35.638 align:start position:0%
my view
 
05:18:38.090 --> 05:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
I do also want to note
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
um again I just I said just a few
 
05:18:42.050 --> 05:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
moments ago you know we've we've lost
 
05:18:43.670 --> 05:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
we've lost our way over the past 30
 
05:18:45.288 --> 05:18:45.298 align:start position:0%
years since this language and I just do
 
05:18:47.390 --> 05:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
want to give some examples
 
05:18:48.830 --> 05:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
I want to just give a shout out to miss
 
05:18:50.930 --> 05:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
ortolano who just testified
 
05:18:54.288 --> 05:18:54.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:54.298 --> 05:18:56.090 align:start position:0%
 
because

05:18:56.090 --> 05:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:18:56.100 --> 05:19:02.230 align:start position:0%
because
um

05:19:02.230 --> 05:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:05.390 --> 05:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
I hope it's going to be a just a very I
 
05:19:07.970 --> 05:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
have 30 seconds and I I want to say
 
05:19:10.070 --> 05:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
number one other states do this it's in
 
05:19:12.590 --> 05:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
the last page of my testimony but lastly
 
05:19:15.050 --> 05:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
in response Miss Orlando didn't say this
 
05:19:18.230 --> 05:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
but in response to her work in the
 
05:19:19.670 --> 05:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
months this is from the union leader in
 
05:19:21.890 --> 05:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
2021. in the months that followed her
 
05:19:23.448 --> 05:19:23.458 align:start position:0%
disclosures the city ordered the
 
05:19:25.610 --> 05:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
national city of Nashville ordered a
 
05:19:26.868 --> 05:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
management audit if it's assessing
 
05:19:29.208 --> 05:19:29.218 align:start position:0%
Department replaced its longtime Chief
 
05:19:30.590 --> 05:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
assessor retained a lawyer to
 
05:19:32.690 --> 05:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
investigate the assessor and was subject
 
05:19:34.430 --> 05:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
to a review by the State Board of land
 
05:19:36.650 --> 05:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
and tax appeals that's why our chapter
 
05:19:39.288 --> 05:19:39.298 align:start position:0%
91a exists for government accountability
 
05:19:41.150 --> 05:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
we still have examples where the
 
05:19:42.890 --> 05:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
government is not producing documents
 
05:19:44.570 --> 05:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
including police records in a case I'm
 
05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
about to litigate at the Supreme Court
 
05:19:47.750 --> 05:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
even though the Supreme Court has said
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
police records for the most part should
 
05:19:51.410 --> 05:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
be released so I think for all these
 
05:19:53.330 --> 05:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
reasons I would request that the
 
05:19:55.430 --> 05:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee vote this bill allowed to pass
 
05:19:58.390 --> 05:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry for talking for
 
05:20:01.970 --> 05:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:05.330 --> 05:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
questions for members of the committee
 
05:20:07.128 --> 05:20:07.138 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
 
05:20:07.138 --> 05:20:08.510 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
you

05:20:08.510 --> 05:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:20:16.430 --> 05:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:18.110 --> 05:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:20:19.730 --> 05:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
committee for holding this hearing today
 
05:20:21.590 --> 05:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh just for the record my name is Ross
 
05:20:23.150 --> 05:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
Connolly I'm the deputy state director
 
05:20:25.010 --> 05:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
for Americans for Prosperity in New
 
05:20:25.020 --> 05:20:25.850 align:start position:0%
for Americans for Prosperity in New
Hampshire

05:20:25.850 --> 05:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:20:29.330 --> 05:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
here to voice our support for HB 307 uh
 
05:20:31.190 --> 05:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we really pride ourselves
 
05:20:34.010 --> 05:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
on the transparent and open nature of
 
05:20:36.890 --> 05:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
our government every part of our our
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
government is accessible and open to the
 
05:20:41.448 --> 05:20:41.458 align:start position:0%
public but as we've heard in recent
 
05:20:43.550 --> 05:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
years there's uh when it comes to our
 
05:20:47.628 --> 05:20:47.638 align:start position:0%
91a records uh requests there's been a
 
05:20:50.090 --> 05:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
suffering of lack of lack of response
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
and really a timely manner uh and and uh
 
05:20:58.490 --> 05:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
not as transparent as it should be uh
 
05:21:00.470 --> 05:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
but this bill provides really a simple
 
05:21:04.610 --> 05:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
solution as we've heard uh to to bring
 
05:21:06.650 --> 05:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
more sunlight and into into government
 
05:21:08.930 --> 05:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
and have more of these these records
 
05:21:12.410 --> 05:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
requests be be honored and respected
 
05:21:12.420 --> 05:21:13.010 align:start position:0%
requests be be honored and respected
um

05:21:13.010 --> 05:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:13.020 --> 05:21:14.690 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:21:14.690 --> 05:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:21:17.990 --> 05:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
really what we view this bill it is a
 
05:21:21.288 --> 05:21:21.298 align:start position:0%
powerful powerful incentive that if a
 
05:21:23.750 --> 05:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is going to be brought that it's
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
it's uh respected and taken more
 
05:21:29.810 --> 05:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
seriously uh when when it's there's
 
05:21:31.970 --> 05:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
there's skin in the game for both sides
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
so we we want to make sure that that our
 
05:21:36.590 --> 05:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
government records are open to the
 
05:21:38.628 --> 05:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
public people can't access them they're
 
05:21:40.970 --> 05:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
not being hidden uh because when that
 
05:21:43.070 --> 05:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
happens people
 
05:21:45.288 --> 05:21:45.298 align:start position:0%
find distrust in government breeds
 
05:21:48.350 --> 05:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theories and results in a
 
05:21:49.970 --> 05:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
very negative view towards government
 
05:21:51.830 --> 05:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
employees and agencies and we want to
 
05:21:54.770 --> 05:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
make sure that that is uh not happening
 
05:21:57.890 --> 05:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
and that uh that the these things are
 
05:21:59.868 --> 05:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
are brought out in into the the open
 
05:22:02.350 --> 05:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
because in our mind sunlight is the best
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
disinfectant uh so for these reasons we
 
05:22:08.030 --> 05:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to to move this bill
 
05:22:09.708 --> 05:22:09.718 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and be happy to take any
 
05:22:11.810 --> 05:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any questions for
 
05:22:13.730 --> 05:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
05:22:15.530 --> 05:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thanks
 
05:22:16.610 --> 05:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
so much
 
05:22:20.810 --> 05:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else uh here who wishes
 
05:22:25.788 --> 05:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
to testify on HB 307 FN
 
05:22:28.190 --> 05:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
05:22:32.750 --> 05:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on that and I would like to um I
 
05:22:35.770 --> 05:22:35.780 align:start position:0%
had recessed the hearing earlier on HB
 
05:22:38.510 --> 05:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
289 we were looking for representative
 
05:22:38.520 --> 05:22:41.090 align:start position:0%
289 we were looking for representative
Corcoran

05:22:41.090 --> 05:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
Corcoran
 
05:22:41.100 --> 05:22:42.110 align:start position:0%
Corcoran
um

05:22:42.110 --> 05:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:44.570 --> 05:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
and I don't see him here I'm concerned
 
05:22:47.208 --> 05:22:47.218 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering if maybe I could ask
 
05:22:48.948 --> 05:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr Walla could you just introduce a
 
05:22:51.110 --> 05:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
bill and the reason I say that is we
 
05:22:53.390 --> 05:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
have a witness here Miss Burns
 
05:22:55.368 --> 05:22:55.378 align:start position:0%
is here I believe
 
05:22:57.530 --> 05:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
who was going who wanted to testify in
 
05:22:59.750 --> 05:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill and I don't so I
 
05:23:01.128 --> 05:23:01.138 align:start position:0%
don't I think we need to have the
 
05:23:03.050 --> 05:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill but I wonder if you
 
05:23:05.690 --> 05:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
would mind Vice chair just introducing
 
05:23:25.310 --> 05:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:26.990 --> 05:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%

representative Scott Wallace Rockingham
 
05:23:32.690 --> 05:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
County District 8 the town of Danville
 
05:23:36.110 --> 05:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to introduce House Bill 289
 
05:23:38.810 --> 05:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
FN an act relative to consultation with
 
05:23:40.910 --> 05:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
legal counsel under the right to know
 
05:23:40.920 --> 05:23:42.050 align:start position:0%
legal counsel under the right to know
law

05:23:42.050 --> 05:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:23:44.270 --> 05:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
this bill prohibits a public official
 
05:23:46.368 --> 05:23:46.378 align:start position:0%
from retaining legal counsel for the
 
05:23:48.050 --> 05:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
purpose of evading compliance with the
 
05:23:50.510 --> 05:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
right to know law and makes violation of
 
05:23:52.970 --> 05:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
the requirement a misdemeanor
 
05:23:55.310 --> 05:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I'll take no questions all right
 
05:23:59.170 --> 05:23:59.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
05:23:59.180 --> 05:24:00.850 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative

I'm going to call um uh Margaret Burns
 
05:24:07.310 --> 05:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you uh if you'd uh
 
05:24:13.030 --> 05:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:15.410 --> 05:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you again I'm Margaret burns with
 
05:24:17.030 --> 05:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
05:24:21.650 --> 05:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
here in opposition to House Bill 289. we
 
05:24:24.530 --> 05:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
think we understand what the bill means
 
05:24:28.368 --> 05:24:28.378 align:start position:0%
and that its purpose is to state that a
 
05:24:30.770 --> 05:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
government official can't hire an
 
05:24:33.050 --> 05:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
attorney to help them violate the law I
 
05:24:35.270 --> 05:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
believe that is what the language in the
 
05:24:37.850 --> 05:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
bill is getting at we agree that a
 
05:24:39.590 --> 05:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
government official should not hire an
 
05:24:41.990 --> 05:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
attorney to assist them in violating the
 
05:24:44.510 --> 05:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
law or that any person should hire an
 
05:24:46.430 --> 05:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
attorney to assist them in violating the
 
05:24:49.490 --> 05:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
law and we believe that rule 1.2 of the
 
05:24:51.288 --> 05:24:51.298 align:start position:0%
rules of professional conduct would
 
05:24:54.110 --> 05:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
already cover this situation that rule
 
05:24:56.570 --> 05:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
states that a lawyer shall not consult a
 
05:24:59.448 --> 05:24:59.458 align:start position:0%
client to engage or to assist a client
 
05:25:01.550 --> 05:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
in conduct that a lawyer knows is
 
05:25:04.128 --> 05:25:04.138 align:start position:0%
criminal or fraudulent for this reason
 
05:25:06.110 --> 05:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
we don't believe this language being
 
05:25:08.150 --> 05:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
added to this provision of the right to
 
05:25:10.490 --> 05:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
know law is necessary and would ask that
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
the committee recommend the bill as in
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank you
 
05:25:17.690 --> 05:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative greeson
 
05:25:18.948 --> 05:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:25:20.930 --> 05:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
taking our questions isn't the fact that
 
05:25:25.128 --> 05:25:25.138 align:start position:0%
although some language already exists
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
and yet the behavior still continues to
 
05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
occur that clearly something needs to be
 
05:25:33.890 --> 05:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
done to address the fact that despite
 
05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
what's in the law
 
05:25:38.150 --> 05:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's still occurring
 
05:25:40.010 --> 05:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question there are
 
05:25:42.470 --> 05:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
already serious penalties for
 
05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
individuals that take action to
 
05:25:47.030 --> 05:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
intentionally violate the right to know
 
05:25:49.250 --> 05:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
law or take other actions especially in
 
05:25:51.590 --> 05:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
their governmental capacity to violate
 
05:25:53.690 --> 05:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
the law engage in fraudulent or other
 
05:25:56.810 --> 05:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
misconduct obviously misconduct occurs
 
05:25:59.810 --> 05:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
in every industry and every faction of
 
05:26:02.810 --> 05:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
government and I think we would see if
 
05:26:06.470 --> 05:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
we tried to reiterate and address every
 
05:26:08.868 --> 05:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
possible piece of misconduct that could
 
05:26:11.150 --> 05:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
happen we could see an endless edition
 
05:26:14.330 --> 05:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
of Provisions to the law to put into
 
05:26:16.970 --> 05:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
place those particular situations that
 
05:26:19.788 --> 05:26:19.798 align:start position:0%
have occurred so I would suggest that
 
05:26:22.610 --> 05:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
the law already covers this situation
 
05:26:25.070 --> 05:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
and it's simply not necessary to put
 
05:26:27.350 --> 05:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
more language into this provision in the
 
05:26:27.360 --> 05:26:28.788 align:start position:0%
more language into this provision in the
statute

05:26:28.788 --> 05:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:26:32.030 --> 05:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
again I believe I understand the bill to
 
05:26:35.570 --> 05:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
mean what I think it means
 
05:26:38.270 --> 05:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
questions yes uh representative Lorenzo
 
05:26:40.490 --> 05:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney Burns who gets to
 
05:26:42.958 --> 05:26:44.208 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney Burns who gets to
decide

05:26:44.208 --> 05:26:44.218 align:start position:0%
decide
 
05:26:44.218 --> 05:26:45.050 align:start position:0%
decide
um

05:26:45.050 --> 05:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:49.788 --> 05:26:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:51.948 --> 05:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
um it could be as the result of a
 
05:26:54.110 --> 05:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecution
 
05:26:56.750 --> 05:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
um it could so in in the situation of
 
05:26:58.730 --> 05:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
governmental misconduct you could see a
 
05:27:00.650 --> 05:27:00.660 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecution or you could see a
 
05:27:02.930 --> 05:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
civil lawsuit being brought and both
 
05:27:05.090 --> 05:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
could occur for the same conduct
 
05:27:07.070 --> 05:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
criminal and civil action
 
05:27:09.770 --> 05:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
it's a follow-up so that would be that
 
05:27:12.170 --> 05:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
would be um
 
05:27:15.948 --> 05:27:15.958 align:start position:0%
after the fact correct
 
05:27:19.128 --> 05:27:19.138 align:start position:0%
that's correct con misconduct would have
 
05:27:20.990 --> 05:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
to occur for there to be
 
05:27:23.390 --> 05:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
Crim a criminal proceeding taken against
 
05:27:33.288 --> 05:27:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:35.030 --> 05:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
Defender and I'll call
 
05:27:35.040 --> 05:27:36.650 align:start position:0%
Defender and I'll call
um

05:27:36.650 --> 05:27:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:39.830 --> 05:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:43.310 --> 05:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
looking to defend their
 
05:27:46.910 --> 05:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:52.970 --> 05:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:56.030 --> 05:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know I mean
 
05:27:59.930 --> 05:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
would that be like a violation of the
 
05:28:02.690 --> 05:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution as far as
 
05:28:07.010 --> 05:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:09.708 --> 05:28:09.718 align:start position:0%
point of
 
05:28:12.288 --> 05:28:12.298 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm not sure I understand the
 
05:28:15.410 --> 05:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
question I I don't see a constitutional
 
05:28:20.208 --> 05:28:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:22.128 --> 05:28:22.138 align:start position:0%
this bill prohibits a public official
 
05:28:24.288 --> 05:28:24.298 align:start position:0%
from retaining legal counsel for the
 
05:28:26.208 --> 05:28:26.218 align:start position:0%
purpose of evading compliance with the
 
05:28:28.910 --> 05:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
right to no law and makes violation of
 
05:28:32.090 --> 05:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
the requirement of misdemeanor
 
05:28:33.650 --> 05:28:33.660 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm just having a hard time
 
05:28:35.270 --> 05:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
with this I'm sorry
 
05:28:39.350 --> 05:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:42.830 --> 05:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
the bill says that it prohibits
 
05:28:45.050 --> 05:28:45.060 align:start position:0%
public official for retaining legal
 
05:28:48.770 --> 05:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
counsel oh I I apologize I see I
 
05:28:50.510 --> 05:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying
 
05:28:53.270 --> 05:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it certainly prohibits
 
05:28:54.948 --> 05:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
a public official in general from
 
05:28:57.470 --> 05:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
acquiring legal counsel it is trying to
 
05:29:00.770 --> 05:29:00.780 align:start position:0%
Target an already improper reason for
 
05:29:03.170 --> 05:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
retaining an attorney which would be for
 
05:29:05.628 --> 05:29:05.638 align:start position:0%
illegal purposes
 
05:29:07.910 --> 05:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
so you know if I could just that raises
 
05:29:10.850 --> 05:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
am I understanding correctly that
 
05:29:12.830 --> 05:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
this the
 
05:29:12.840 --> 05:29:14.930 align:start position:0%
this the
subsection

05:29:14.930 --> 05:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
subsection
 
05:29:18.050 --> 05:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
L that this amends the purpose of that
 
05:29:20.810 --> 05:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
subsection is to say these are the times
 
05:29:23.270 --> 05:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
when you don't have to have a public
 
05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
meeting right and so one of them is if
 
05:29:27.410 --> 05:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
you're going to talk about something
 
05:29:29.570 --> 05:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
that you've consulted with Council and
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
what this is designed to say is if
 
05:29:34.970 --> 05:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
you've just sort of created when there's
 
05:29:36.650 --> 05:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
no real reason to be Consulting with
 
05:29:38.510 --> 05:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
Council but you've just done it so you
 
05:29:40.550 --> 05:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
can have your meeting in private instead
 
05:29:42.350 --> 05:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
of in public then you're in trouble then
 
05:29:44.150 --> 05:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
you're thank you for that clarification
 
05:29:47.208 --> 05:29:47.218 align:start position:0%
if you do exactly what you just
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
described you were already violating the
 
05:29:51.230 --> 05:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
right to know law
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
um you this is a provision that deals
 
05:29:56.448 --> 05:29:56.458 align:start position:0%
with consultation with an attorney to
 
05:29:59.448 --> 05:29:59.458 align:start position:0%
receive legal advice and you can't use
 
05:30:02.090 --> 05:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
an attorney improperly or for some other
 
05:30:05.810 --> 05:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
cover to be able to evade the right to
 
05:30:07.730 --> 05:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
no law so I think that would not only
 
05:30:10.368 --> 05:30:10.378 align:start position:0%
violate principles relative to rules of
 
05:30:11.930 --> 05:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
professional conduct but it would
 
05:30:13.430 --> 05:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
violate another provision of the right
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
to no law which prohibits local
 
05:30:18.410 --> 05:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
officials from in looking for ways to
 
05:30:20.208 --> 05:30:20.218 align:start position:0%
evade compliance with the right to know
 
05:30:20.218 --> 05:30:25.490 align:start position:0%
evade compliance with the right to know
law

05:30:25.490 --> 05:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:28.430 --> 05:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much is there anyone else
 
05:30:31.850 --> 05:30:31.860 align:start position:0%

05:30:39.288 --> 05:30:39.298 align:start position:0%
hearing on 289
 
05:30:39.298 --> 05:30:40.070 align:start position:0%

05:30:48.900 --> 05:30:56.110 align:start position:0%
will turn to house bill 308.
foreign

05:30:56.110 --> 05:30:56.120 align:start position:0%

whole legislature is busy we understand
 
05:31:10.430 --> 05:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
so no problem thank you um uh I am
 
05:31:13.670 --> 05:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
Francis Nutter Upham Hillsboro eight
 
05:31:16.368 --> 05:31:16.378 align:start position:0%
um this is my third term on Health and
 
05:31:17.770 --> 05:31:17.780 align:start position:0%
Human Services
 
05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
I've recently been appointed to the rare
 
05:31:25.368 --> 05:31:25.378 align:start position:0%
disease Council and it's because of
 
05:31:28.670 --> 05:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
their meetings that I'm here today
 
05:31:28.680 --> 05:31:30.050 align:start position:0%
their meetings that I'm here today
um

05:31:30.050 --> 05:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
I have an amendment
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
that will replace the former bill
 
05:31:44.628 --> 05:31:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:46.610 --> 05:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
so originally
 
05:31:50.410 --> 05:31:50.420 align:start position:0%
the 308 bill which you looked at was
 
05:31:53.150 --> 05:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
broader reaching than just the rare
 
05:31:56.810 --> 05:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
disease Council and having sat here in
 
05:32:00.850 --> 05:32:00.860 align:start position:0%
the morning I realized that a house bill
 
05:32:04.670 --> 05:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
254 covered a lot of the same territory
 
05:32:04.680 --> 05:32:06.530 align:start position:0%
254 covered a lot of the same territory
better

05:32:06.530 --> 05:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:32:06.540 --> 05:32:07.970 align:start position:0%
better
so

05:32:07.970 --> 05:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:32:10.430 --> 05:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
um that's why I'm offering this
 
05:32:13.990 --> 05:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
amendment which would allow
 
05:32:18.530 --> 05:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
remote Quorum access for the rare
 
05:32:20.868 --> 05:32:20.878 align:start position:0%
disease Council
 
05:32:24.708 --> 05:32:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:27.470 --> 05:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
there's many reasons that they need to
 
05:32:29.170 --> 05:32:29.180 align:start position:0%
meet remotely
 
05:32:31.970 --> 05:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
most importantly is that some of them
 
05:32:35.868 --> 05:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
have chronic forever rare diseases that
 
05:32:37.850 --> 05:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
they just cannot be in contact with
 
05:32:41.410 --> 05:32:41.420 align:start position:0%
other people so we realize that covid
 
05:32:44.150 --> 05:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
quarantine and contact kind of goes in
 
05:32:47.448 --> 05:32:47.458 align:start position:0%
and out but some of the the parents or
 
05:32:49.510 --> 05:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
parents of children with rare diseases
 
05:32:54.470 --> 05:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
that make up this Council it's just not
 
05:32:57.530 --> 05:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
really possible for them to come the
 
05:33:01.550 --> 05:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
committee the council does have a
 
05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
physical meeting place Hazen drive and
 
05:33:08.230 --> 05:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
they run you know so it meets that
 
05:33:13.850 --> 05:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
stipulation if 354 was to pass the
 
05:33:13.860 --> 05:33:15.890 align:start position:0%
stipulation if 354 was to pass the
minimum

05:33:15.890 --> 05:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
05:33:19.070 --> 05:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
Quorum requirement was one-third and I
 
05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
just don't know that it's reasonable for
 
05:33:23.448 --> 05:33:23.458 align:start position:0%
this committee to be able
 
05:33:27.770 --> 05:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
Council be able to meet that the
 
05:33:31.128 --> 05:33:31.138 align:start position:0%
the people on this committee are
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
um medical researchers doctors up at
 
05:33:36.230 --> 05:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock and other places
 
05:33:39.050 --> 05:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
throughout the state that I am grateful
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
that they're able to give an hour of
 
05:33:43.970 --> 05:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
their time to come in remotely but to
 
05:33:47.448 --> 05:33:47.458 align:start position:0%
expect them to take maybe five hours out
 
05:33:50.868 --> 05:33:50.878 align:start position:0%
of their remarkable schedules to come to
 
05:33:55.368 --> 05:33:55.378 align:start position:0%
Concord to give a a monthly report is is
 
05:33:59.270 --> 05:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
not reasonable so I'm willing if there's
 
05:34:01.868 --> 05:34:01.878 align:start position:0%
something about this amendment that
 
05:34:04.910 --> 05:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
bugs you or think we could be tweaked
 
05:34:07.788 --> 05:34:07.798 align:start position:0%
better I'm I'm willing to uh go forward
 
05:34:09.530 --> 05:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
with that
 
05:34:09.540 --> 05:34:11.628 align:start position:0%
with that
um

05:34:11.628 --> 05:34:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:13.850 --> 05:34:13.860 align:start position:0%
and I just think it's it's an important
 
05:34:16.490 --> 05:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
it's important medically for our state
 
05:34:20.090 --> 05:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
that this Council continue to operate
 
05:34:21.890 --> 05:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
and they haven't been able to vote on
 
05:34:24.230 --> 05:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
their minutes in over a year
 
05:34:27.288 --> 05:34:27.298 align:start position:0%
I also have um I'll leave a pile there
 
05:34:29.208 --> 05:34:29.218 align:start position:0%
but I brought the original Bill about
 
05:34:34.070 --> 05:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
why the council was formed and for your
 
05:34:36.590 --> 05:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
reading you would kind it would be
 
05:34:38.510 --> 05:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
better than me reading it to you so but
 
05:34:40.910 --> 05:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'll leave a file there
 
05:34:42.670 --> 05:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
05:34:47.448 --> 05:34:47.458 align:start position:0%
uh Dr kanurk has I think sent you all a
 
05:34:49.910 --> 05:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
letter and representative Wendy Thomas
 
05:34:53.208 --> 05:34:53.218 align:start position:0%
also had testimony that she was going to
 
05:34:58.070 --> 05:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
give so I can ask her to uh
 
05:35:01.368 --> 05:35:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:05.030 --> 05:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes are you are you ready to take
 
05:35:05.040 --> 05:35:08.390 align:start position:0%
uh yes are you are you ready to take
questions

05:35:08.390 --> 05:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:10.368 --> 05:35:10.378 align:start position:0%
this seems like a little bit of a
 
05:35:12.050 --> 05:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
non-germaine Amendment here was the
 
05:35:15.050 --> 05:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
original intention for
 
05:35:19.310 --> 05:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
this bill to only Encompass this one
 
05:35:19.320 --> 05:35:20.868 align:start position:0%
this bill to only Encompass this one
Council

05:35:20.868 --> 05:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
Council
 
05:35:23.030 --> 05:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
well so
 
05:35:26.270 --> 05:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh office of legislative Services is new
 
05:35:29.448 --> 05:35:29.458 align:start position:0%
and so when I I mean they're
 
05:35:31.610 --> 05:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
not the office but many of the new
 
05:35:34.788 --> 05:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
lawyers on it are new so when I said I'm
 
05:35:37.850 --> 05:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for a way for this Council
 
05:35:38.930 --> 05:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
05:35:41.570 --> 05:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
Quorum and
 
05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
um they didn't write it narrowly they
 
05:35:47.690 --> 05:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
wrote it broadly they just wiped out uh
 
05:35:50.330 --> 05:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
some so my intent
 
05:35:51.890 --> 05:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
was that
 
05:35:55.128 --> 05:35:55.138 align:start position:0%
this would cover this Council and if it
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
was able to cover other councils with
 
05:36:00.170 --> 05:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
special needs like this that would be
 
05:36:00.180 --> 05:36:01.128 align:start position:0%
special needs like this that would be
okay

05:36:01.128 --> 05:36:01.138 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um yeah because I think
 
05:36:06.050 --> 05:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
also the special needs advisory Council
 
05:36:08.570 --> 05:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
had voiced earlier that they had similar
 
05:36:10.070 --> 05:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
issues however in looking at this
 
05:36:11.930 --> 05:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
council's makeup I see that it's made up
 
05:36:14.510 --> 05:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
of about 11 members and I see that two
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
of them are House Representatives and
 
05:36:18.770 --> 05:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
one of them's a member of the Senate and
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
one of them is a commissioner of the
 
05:36:21.650 --> 05:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:36:23.990 --> 05:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
so that would be four of eleven that
 
05:36:25.628 --> 05:36:25.638 align:start position:0%
would be one-third
 
05:36:28.490 --> 05:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
that would seem like they would be able
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
to be present
 
05:36:32.270 --> 05:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
um the rest of them I could see perhaps
 
05:36:33.770 --> 05:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
if there's a reason why they couldn't be
 
05:36:36.770 --> 05:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
but those people there I'm unsure
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
why on a regular basis that they
 
05:36:40.670 --> 05:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to be in person
 
05:36:43.490 --> 05:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
the represent well um for instance last
 
05:36:45.770 --> 05:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
year no appointments were made so we
 
05:36:49.368 --> 05:36:49.378 align:start position:0%
went a whole year with a missing member
 
05:36:52.730 --> 05:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
but um the speaker seems to be
 
05:36:54.770 --> 05:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
um proficient at that this year and and
 
05:36:56.270 --> 05:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
we're getting the letters about who's
 
05:36:58.368 --> 05:36:58.378 align:start position:0%
appointed on so that was a problem last
 
05:37:02.090 --> 05:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
year that may not be a problem this year
 
05:37:02.100 --> 05:37:03.890 align:start position:0%
year that may not be a problem this year
um

05:37:03.890 --> 05:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:06.410 --> 05:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
certainly I'll drive up from Nashua you
 
05:37:09.110 --> 05:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
know whatever so they haven't appointed
 
05:37:12.470 --> 05:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
the other uh State Legislature
 
05:37:15.830 --> 05:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
to this committee yet so but I hear your
 
05:37:17.628 --> 05:37:17.638 align:start position:0%
point other questions for this one yes
 
05:37:19.610 --> 05:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you my my
 
05:37:21.350 --> 05:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
questions kind of um pivoting off the
 
05:37:23.570 --> 05:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
clerks in the in the question of if it's
 
05:37:25.970 --> 05:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
if it's only 11 members like what's
 
05:37:28.550 --> 05:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
stopping the 11 members from meeting in
 
05:37:30.650 --> 05:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
a socially distant way
 
05:37:31.970 --> 05:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
um in the New Hampshire house for
 
05:37:33.948 --> 05:37:33.958 align:start position:0%
instance in the chambers I mean I'm sure
 
05:37:35.090 --> 05:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
the speaker would be willing to
 
05:37:37.788 --> 05:37:37.798 align:start position:0%
accommodate there's only two members
 
05:37:40.490 --> 05:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
that are from the house and one from the
 
05:37:42.110 --> 05:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
center I'm sure that the 11 members
 
05:37:44.390 --> 05:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
could use the chamber for purpose of a
 
05:37:45.770 --> 05:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
meeting well I think socially distant
 
05:37:47.868 --> 05:37:47.878 align:start position:0%
way right yeah I don't think that's good
 
05:37:50.330 --> 05:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
enough for some of the ailments that
 
05:37:51.770 --> 05:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
these people suffer for that that
 
05:37:53.510 --> 05:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be safe enough even to come
 
05:37:55.970 --> 05:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
into a public building just wouldn't be
 
05:37:57.830 --> 05:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
safe enough
 
05:38:00.948 --> 05:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
um but good point I I hear you
 
05:38:04.190 --> 05:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
yes I do remember oh I'm sorry I'm sorry
 
05:38:07.310 --> 05:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
too sorry I do remember this bill from
 
05:38:10.850 --> 05:38:10.860 align:start position:0%
um last term and the issue was that a
 
05:38:13.750 --> 05:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the folks on the council were
 
05:38:16.910 --> 05:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
very disabled yes and had trouble you
 
05:38:20.810 --> 05:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
know getting out and so this bill or the
 
05:38:22.850 --> 05:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
issue was to make an accommodation to
 
05:38:26.570 --> 05:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
them because of their um inability to
 
05:38:36.050 --> 05:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:37.368 --> 05:38:37.378 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
05:38:39.948 --> 05:38:39.958 align:start position:0%
um did somebody else have a question or
 
05:38:43.368 --> 05:38:43.378 align:start position:0%
no representative go ahead please
 
05:38:45.410 --> 05:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
so perhaps I'm a bit confused so I'm
 
05:38:46.850 --> 05:38:46.860 align:start position:0%
hoping to get clarification what I'm
 
05:38:49.730 --> 05:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
seeing is that the members are only two
 
05:38:51.830 --> 05:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
persons living with a rare disease and
 
05:38:53.810 --> 05:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
then one parent or guardian of a child
 
05:38:55.970 --> 05:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
with a rare disease the rest are again
 
05:38:58.670 --> 05:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
legislators or a physician or a nurse
 
05:39:01.010 --> 05:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
practitioner so I'm only seeing that
 
05:39:02.810 --> 05:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
less than one-third of those people
 
05:39:04.910 --> 05:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
would have a rare disease am I looking
 
05:39:06.288 --> 05:39:06.298 align:start position:0%
at the wrong thing I just wanted to
 
05:39:08.570 --> 05:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
clarify no I think you're correct but
 
05:39:11.090 --> 05:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
the other point I made was that it it's
 
05:39:11.100 --> 05:39:12.708 align:start position:0%
the other point I made was that it it's
um

05:39:12.708 --> 05:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:16.010 --> 05:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
to ask one of those doctors to drive two
 
05:39:18.170 --> 05:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
hours here for an hour meeting and then
 
05:39:23.330 --> 05:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:27.110 --> 05:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
what other yes representative Perez
 
05:39:29.510 --> 05:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
how long has this group been in
 
05:39:32.690 --> 05:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
existence um 2019
 
05:39:35.330 --> 05:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
so that was during it came about with
 
05:39:35.340 --> 05:39:36.410 align:start position:0%
so that was during it came about with
covid

05:39:36.410 --> 05:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
covid
 
05:39:38.510 --> 05:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
so you really haven't had an option to
 
05:39:40.250 --> 05:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
meet much together how often do you meet
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh once a month once a month so not
 
05:39:45.708 --> 05:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
always in the summer I've attended so I
 
05:39:48.350 --> 05:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
just formally got my letter that I'm on
 
05:39:52.310 --> 05:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
it last week but I have attended four or
 
05:39:55.208 --> 05:39:55.218 align:start position:0%
five meetings over the last three years
 
05:39:58.310 --> 05:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
and approximately how many members have
 
05:40:01.070 --> 05:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
shown up over these meetings in the past
 
05:40:04.368 --> 05:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
couple of years uh about eight out of 11
 
05:40:07.010 --> 05:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
and there's 11 in it yeah okay thank you
 
05:40:09.530 --> 05:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah other questions for yes
 
05:40:10.910 --> 05:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander just just
 
05:40:12.770 --> 05:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
pivoting off that if the eight have
 
05:40:14.208 --> 05:40:14.218 align:start position:0%
attended the meeting how can you not
 
05:40:15.890 --> 05:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
vote on minutes before the previous
 
05:40:19.788 --> 05:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
meetings to vote online
 
05:40:22.128 --> 05:40:22.138 align:start position:0%
or their interpretation
 
05:40:24.170 --> 05:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
you've had meetings in person with me no
 
05:40:26.868 --> 05:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
no they were all on Zoom they're they've
 
05:40:28.610 --> 05:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
all been on Zoom thank you so if they
 
05:40:30.170 --> 05:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
were allowed to vote the minutes on Zoom
 
05:40:32.150 --> 05:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
they would gladly have done so perfect
 
05:40:34.190 --> 05:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
05:40:36.590 --> 05:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions so you know yes
 
05:40:38.750 --> 05:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp
 
05:40:42.350 --> 05:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
so um this was a public meeting
 
05:40:47.090 --> 05:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
it can be uh it's noticed in the uh in
 
05:40:50.150 --> 05:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
our calendar and a public could come
 
05:40:52.190 --> 05:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
it being a public meeting there were
 
05:40:58.010 --> 05:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:01.628 --> 05:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
no no I think
 
05:41:05.330 --> 05:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
well I think we had a a visitor by Zoom
 
05:41:07.970 --> 05:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
but we haven't been in person they've
 
05:41:10.010 --> 05:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
all been zoomed so we've had visitors
 
05:41:12.830 --> 05:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
via Zoom attend these meetings all right
 
05:41:16.628 --> 05:41:16.638 align:start position:0%
so which is encouraged and welcomed
 
05:41:20.030 --> 05:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
track of my question so I'm gonna be
 
05:41:22.788 --> 05:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
quiet we have thank you representative
 
05:41:25.010 --> 05:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
Tripp we have other questions so I I
 
05:41:26.270 --> 05:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
guess I do
 
05:41:29.390 --> 05:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
oh yes I'm sorry certainly
 
05:41:32.990 --> 05:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
so so is this a need of the state
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
um for these um these people that are uh
 
05:41:40.010 --> 05:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
disabled and I can't get out is this a
 
05:41:41.750 --> 05:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
great need for
 
05:41:43.430 --> 05:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
um you know the constituents you know
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
out there
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
that this committee this council is able
 
05:41:49.490 --> 05:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
is of great need for everyone
 
05:41:54.288 --> 05:41:54.298 align:start position:0%
dealing with all kinds of rare diseases
 
05:41:56.810 --> 05:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
I'm grandmother of a young man with a
 
05:41:59.270 --> 05:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
rare disease a survivor of an odd cancer
 
05:41:59.280 --> 05:42:00.430 align:start position:0%
rare disease a survivor of an odd cancer
myself

05:42:00.430 --> 05:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
myself
 
05:42:04.070 --> 05:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
and it's it's so important that um
 
05:42:06.110 --> 05:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
people doing research are able to talk
 
05:42:09.890 --> 05:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
to each other and and you know follow up
 
05:42:12.110 --> 05:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
what's the latest what's coming up what
 
05:42:14.448 --> 05:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
other states are doing what a it's
 
05:42:16.490 --> 05:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
crucial that's why they passed this bill
 
05:42:18.890 --> 05:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
in the first place I mean not my bill
 
05:42:22.010 --> 05:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
but the bill to form the council
 
05:42:26.208 --> 05:42:26.218 align:start position:0%
so can I follow up and just say in
 
05:42:28.490 --> 05:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how this so I'm new to
 
05:42:30.708 --> 05:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
this but I just want to say could we
 
05:42:33.230 --> 05:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
make an exception to
 
05:42:35.510 --> 05:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
um as we discuss things and to go
 
05:42:39.890 --> 05:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
forward to allow them to have a remote
 
05:42:42.948 --> 05:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
access if they needed to they cannot
 
05:42:46.250 --> 05:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
come physically to the meeting that they
 
05:42:49.310 --> 05:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
could but again well that's kind of what
 
05:42:52.670 --> 05:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
I'm asking is for uh that the remote
 
05:42:55.030 --> 05:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
Quorum be
 
05:42:57.590 --> 05:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
allowed for them because of their
 
05:43:00.410 --> 05:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
special circumstances and
 
05:43:03.948 --> 05:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
you know if 254 goes through
 
05:43:06.470 --> 05:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're almost covered here except
 
05:43:09.708 --> 05:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
for maybe the Quorum but if 254 doesn't
 
05:43:12.230 --> 05:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
go through I need this bill to go
 
05:43:15.230 --> 05:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
through so that this Council can meet
 
05:43:19.730 --> 05:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:19.740 --> 05:43:22.788 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:43:22.788 --> 05:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:24.770 --> 05:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
05:43:27.410 --> 05:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
as a nurse I'm just I'm concerned as
 
05:43:29.690 --> 05:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
well so that's I just hearing about this
 
05:43:34.368 --> 05:43:34.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:37.970 --> 05:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
um any other questions for this witness
 
05:43:41.030 --> 05:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
so I guess I do have one question I I'm
 
05:43:44.690 --> 05:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
I'm a little troubled by the idea
 
05:43:48.350 --> 05:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
I mean that the the bill
 
05:43:52.670 --> 05:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
before the amendment seem to
 
05:43:55.310 --> 05:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
seem to be a more General bill that
 
05:43:59.208 --> 05:43:59.218 align:start position:0%
would allow remote participation and
 
05:43:59.218 --> 05:44:00.830 align:start position:0%
would allow remote participation and
I

05:44:00.830 --> 05:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:44:00.840 --> 05:44:01.490 align:start position:0%
I
um

05:44:01.490 --> 05:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm I'm a little troubled by the
 
05:44:06.708 --> 05:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
eye with your proposed amendment would
 
05:44:09.470 --> 05:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
limit it to just this uh the rare
 
05:44:11.690 --> 05:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
disease advisory Council and so I'm
 
05:44:11.700 --> 05:44:12.830 align:start position:0%
disease advisory Council and so I'm
wondering

05:44:12.830 --> 05:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
05:44:15.288 --> 05:44:15.298 align:start position:0%
I mean what would be
 
05:44:18.110 --> 05:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
what would be our justification I mean I
 
05:44:19.850 --> 05:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
understand you have you have two people
 
05:44:22.368 --> 05:44:22.378 align:start position:0%
that are on that Council that have that
 
05:44:24.530 --> 05:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
have some kind of condition but or more
 
05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
or maybe more but I'm wondering what
 
05:44:30.830 --> 05:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
would be the basis for uh singling out
 
05:44:33.890 --> 05:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
that advisory Council I mean if we were
 
05:44:35.510 --> 05:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
going to pass a law like this wouldn't
 
05:44:37.310 --> 05:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
we want to make it generally applicable
 
05:44:39.650 --> 05:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
what if there's you know what if the
 
05:44:42.708 --> 05:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
board of realtors has uh two people that
 
05:44:45.890 --> 05:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
are that have are either ill or you know
 
05:44:47.390 --> 05:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
have some kind of condition or have some
 
05:44:49.010 --> 05:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
other reason that they couldn't be there
 
05:44:51.410 --> 05:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
well in a more perfect world I'd be very
 
05:44:54.708 --> 05:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
happy for that I mean a broader one but
 
05:44:57.770 --> 05:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
it seemed that I that uh the original
 
05:45:01.730 --> 05:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
308 would be competing somehow with 254
 
05:45:05.510 --> 05:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
which seemed more thought out and
 
05:45:08.330 --> 05:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
um nuanced right so in other words in
 
05:45:09.350 --> 05:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
other words in my understanding what
 
05:45:11.510 --> 05:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying is you may have drafted
 
05:45:14.690 --> 05:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
the bill to be just for this one board
 
05:45:16.850 --> 05:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
but you don't have a pro you wouldn't
 
05:45:18.650 --> 05:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
have a problem if it was made more
 
05:45:22.730 --> 05:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
General to no all boards no and I I you
 
05:45:25.490 --> 05:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
know after this morning hearing 254 I
 
05:45:28.430 --> 05:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
had to make a pivot in the hallway like
 
05:45:30.470 --> 05:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
when I used to act and somebody gave you
 
05:45:32.208 --> 05:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
the wrong line from the wrong scene and
 
05:45:33.830 --> 05:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
you just had to kind of go on with the
 
05:45:35.330 --> 05:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
scene like all right we're finishing the
 
05:45:37.788 --> 05:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
play a little early today you know
 
05:45:41.448 --> 05:45:41.458 align:start position:0%
all right so oh no got it okay any other
 
05:45:43.368 --> 05:45:43.378 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
05:45:45.288 --> 05:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:45:46.548 --> 05:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:45:49.310 --> 05:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh and I I'm available for you know
 
05:45:52.628 --> 05:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
rewrites questions you have my number
 
05:45:54.590 --> 05:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:46:05.628 --> 05:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:07.730 --> 05:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and members of the committee
 
05:46:10.070 --> 05:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
and representative Wendy Thomas I
 
05:46:13.270 --> 05:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
represent Merrimack Hills 12.
 
05:46:16.970 --> 05:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
I am going to testify in in support of a
 
05:46:16.980 --> 05:46:18.970 align:start position:0%
I am going to testify in in support of a
general

05:46:18.970 --> 05:46:18.980 align:start position:0%
general
 
05:46:23.270 --> 05:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
allowance of of remote meetings uh times
 
05:46:26.270 --> 05:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
have changed in 2020 we were introduced
 
05:46:29.208 --> 05:46:29.218 align:start position:0%
to zooms which are remote meetings
 
05:46:31.368 --> 05:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
very quickly after that we all became
 
05:46:35.208 --> 05:46:35.218 align:start position:0%
burned out on Zoom meetings but we
 
05:46:38.090 --> 05:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
realized that remote meetings allowed
 
05:46:41.208 --> 05:46:41.218 align:start position:0%
less less travel time it allowed parents
 
05:46:43.250 --> 05:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
to join meetings and it allowed people
 
05:46:46.070 --> 05:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
who are sick those that don't have much
 
05:46:48.830 --> 05:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
left in the tank to attend
 
05:46:52.430 --> 05:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
in 2023 we are finding out that one in
 
05:46:55.490 --> 05:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
10 people will develop long covid after
 
05:46:58.868 --> 05:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
exposure to the virus long covid can be
 
05:47:01.910 --> 05:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
debilitating however people can
 
05:47:04.788 --> 05:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
participate with accommodations we can
 
05:47:07.250 --> 05:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
still benefit from their expertise
 
05:47:10.010 --> 05:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
remote access is no longer a convenient
 
05:47:11.628 --> 05:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
way for people to participate in
 
05:47:14.330 --> 05:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
meetings it is now simply a necessity
 
05:47:16.730 --> 05:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
for much more than one-tenth of our
 
05:47:19.548 --> 05:47:19.558 align:start position:0%
population to actively participate in
 
05:47:20.868 --> 05:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
leadership and decision-making
 
05:47:24.288 --> 05:47:24.298 align:start position:0%
opportunities thank you any questions
 
05:47:26.628 --> 05:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
05:47:28.548 --> 05:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
saying that up yes representative
 
05:47:31.070 --> 05:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
Staples yeah thank you Mr chair and
 
05:47:32.810 --> 05:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
05:47:35.030 --> 05:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
sorry but I didn't clearly hear
 
05:47:37.310 --> 05:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
those Afflicted with covid will develop
 
05:47:41.810 --> 05:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
a kind of an Affliction it's it's it's
 
05:47:45.048 --> 05:47:45.058 align:start position:0%
called long covid for lack of a better
 
05:47:47.030 --> 05:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
word I mean the the medical community is
 
05:47:49.010 --> 05:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
calling it and that's where um
 
05:47:52.310 --> 05:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
persistent um symptoms of of the covid
 
05:47:52.320 --> 05:47:53.570 align:start position:0%
persistent um symptoms of of the covid
infection

05:47:53.570 --> 05:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
infection
 
05:47:56.810 --> 05:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
um continue as an example I'll I'll give
 
05:47:58.190 --> 05:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
my example
 
05:48:01.850 --> 05:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
um in 2020 in November of 2020
 
05:48:05.628 --> 05:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
um I was I had a lot I had covid
 
05:48:05.638 --> 05:48:07.010 align:start position:0%
um I was I had a lot I had covid
and

05:48:07.010 --> 05:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:48:09.288 --> 05:48:09.298 align:start position:0%
um it it didn't hit my lungs it hit my
 
05:48:09.298 --> 05:48:11.150 align:start position:0%
um it it didn't hit my lungs it hit my
gut

05:48:11.150 --> 05:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
gut
 
05:48:14.030 --> 05:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
um I couldn't taste I couldn't smell I
 
05:48:16.128 --> 05:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
had no appetite I had no thirst
 
05:48:18.650 --> 05:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
that persisted for two years
 
05:48:21.650 --> 05:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
the gut portion at some at some points
 
05:48:23.690 --> 05:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
became so severe I literally couldn't
 
05:48:26.628 --> 05:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
leave my house I mean I had to be it's
 
05:48:28.010 --> 05:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
like that commercial where the people
 
05:48:29.868 --> 05:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
are looking for the bathroom
 
05:48:32.270 --> 05:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's gotten a lot better A lot
 
05:48:34.548 --> 05:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
better but it's but I had it for two
 
05:48:34.558 --> 05:48:35.510 align:start position:0%
better but it's but I had it for two
years

05:48:35.510 --> 05:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:48:38.150 --> 05:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately where I work they're very
 
05:48:41.570 --> 05:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
they allowed me to work remotely and to
 
05:48:43.670 --> 05:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
participate you know remotely and that
 
05:48:45.770 --> 05:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
that saved my job
 
05:48:47.930 --> 05:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
so I mean that's work is a different
 
05:48:49.788 --> 05:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
issue from this this is this is
 
05:48:52.128 --> 05:48:52.138 align:start position:0%
attending meetings but we're going to
 
05:48:54.288 --> 05:48:54.298 align:start position:0%
have to be very aware that that one
 
05:48:55.910 --> 05:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
tenth of our population is going to be
 
05:48:58.868 --> 05:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
disabled because of covet
 
05:49:01.430 --> 05:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that explanation you're
 
05:49:03.288 --> 05:49:03.298 align:start position:0%
welcome any other questions for this
 
05:49:03.298 --> 05:49:04.250 align:start position:0%
welcome any other questions for this
Witness

05:49:04.250 --> 05:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
05:49:07.310 --> 05:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
05:49:11.110 --> 05:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
um uh former representative Jerry
 
05:49:13.868 --> 05:49:13.878 align:start position:0%
nerkner he's upstairs
 
05:49:16.910 --> 05:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
all right well let me go on then uh
 
05:49:28.610 --> 05:49:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:30.708 --> 05:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again
 
05:49:30.718 --> 05:49:31.730 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again
um

05:49:31.730 --> 05:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:34.010 --> 05:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
right to know New Hampshire is opposed
 
05:49:36.530 --> 05:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
to HB 308 I will admit I'm trying to
 
05:49:38.090 --> 05:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
catch up on the Amendments that are here
 
05:49:39.110 --> 05:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to speak to the original
 
05:49:40.730 --> 05:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
Bill and to the extent that I'm able to
 
05:49:43.070 --> 05:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
with the Amendments again we recognize
 
05:49:44.868 --> 05:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
the advantages that remote access has
 
05:49:46.730 --> 05:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
provided to engage citizens and and
 
05:49:49.430 --> 05:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
reiterate that there are challenges that
 
05:49:51.650 --> 05:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
have not been addressed in terms of how
 
05:49:53.690 --> 05:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
to conduct remote meetings both for
 
05:49:55.850 --> 05:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
members of the public body and attendees
 
05:49:58.070 --> 05:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
in their presence as well so much of my
 
05:50:00.410 --> 05:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
prior testimony on HB 254 applies
 
05:50:02.090 --> 05:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
regarding the kinds of safeguards that
 
05:50:04.368 --> 05:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
we feel need to be put into place I did
 
05:50:05.810 --> 05:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
have the privilege of speaking with
 
05:50:07.430 --> 05:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter Upham and I
 
05:50:09.110 --> 05:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
understand that the motivation from this
 
05:50:11.750 --> 05:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill comes from a sincere desire to make
 
05:50:13.548 --> 05:50:13.558 align:start position:0%
participation in Statewide meetings
 
05:50:15.410 --> 05:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
easier for committed volunteers and
 
05:50:17.628 --> 05:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who wish to contribute and
 
05:50:19.430 --> 05:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
to conduct business the body she
 
05:50:21.288 --> 05:50:21.298 align:start position:0%
represents does face some unique
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
challenges and just as an added
 
05:50:26.208 --> 05:50:26.218 align:start position:0%
background on myself I have a master's
 
05:50:27.890 --> 05:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
in public health and was doing pandemic
 
05:50:30.350 --> 05:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
planning as far back as 2004 and using
 
05:50:32.270 --> 05:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
the term social distancing law before
 
05:50:34.690 --> 05:50:34.700 align:start position:0%
anybody else probably in this room
 
05:50:37.548 --> 05:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
I'm very much an advocate for the use of
 
05:50:39.170 --> 05:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
remote technology and have been
 
05:50:40.910 --> 05:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
self-employed and using that for a long
 
05:50:43.970 --> 05:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
time but this proposal as it currently
 
05:50:47.890 --> 05:50:47.900 align:start position:0%
stands in 308 in the original version
 
05:50:50.628 --> 05:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
really does remove a lot of the guard
 
05:50:52.368 --> 05:50:52.378 align:start position:0%
rails that are currently in place with
 
05:50:55.788 --> 05:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
the deletion that it suggests most
 
05:50:57.890 --> 05:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
notably the need for a physical meeting
 
05:50:59.570 --> 05:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
location which is now added back into
 
05:51:01.070 --> 05:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment which is why it's getting
 
05:51:03.128 --> 05:51:03.138 align:start position:0%
a little bit confusing
 
05:51:05.510 --> 05:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
but some of the other issues that need
 
05:51:06.830 --> 05:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
to be addressed when we're talking about
 
05:51:08.510 --> 05:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
remote meetings include having a
 
05:51:10.310 --> 05:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism for managing problems with
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
Public Access having a trigger for
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
stopping the public meeting if the
 
05:51:16.190 --> 05:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
public can't access it and what that is
 
05:51:19.070 --> 05:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
and the ability to define the record the
 
05:51:21.350 --> 05:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
recording as a public record currently
 
05:51:22.850 --> 05:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
minutes of a meeting officially
 
05:51:24.708 --> 05:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
constitute the public record and the
 
05:51:26.270 --> 05:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
video may or may not be made available
 
05:51:28.610 --> 05:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
to a citizen there's no guarantee that
 
05:51:30.890 --> 05:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
in the course in the case of a fully
 
05:51:32.570 --> 05:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
remote meeting which could easily be
 
05:51:34.610 --> 05:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
recorded that the official record will
 
05:51:36.470 --> 05:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
include the recording of the meeting or
 
05:51:38.030 --> 05:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
the chats associated with the remote
 
05:51:39.590 --> 05:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
meeting as part of that public record
 
05:51:42.170 --> 05:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of questions about those
 
05:51:44.208 --> 05:51:44.218 align:start position:0%
kinds of technical issues that are still
 
05:51:46.448 --> 05:51:46.458 align:start position:0%
floating around out there
 
05:51:49.368 --> 05:51:49.378 align:start position:0%
as far as the original bill goes and I
 
05:51:51.590 --> 05:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
realize there's a change in the
 
05:51:54.890 --> 05:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
application all proposed changes to 91a
 
05:51:56.570 --> 05:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
should consider whether or not they make
 
05:51:58.250 --> 05:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
meetings or information more or less
 
05:52:01.310 --> 05:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
accessible to the public overall and not
 
05:52:03.830 --> 05:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
in specific cases while Statewide
 
05:52:06.530 --> 05:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
meetings may be a particular challenge a
 
05:52:09.288 --> 05:52:09.298 align:start position:0%
change like this if made to 91a would
 
05:52:10.910 --> 05:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
make it possible for local Boards of
 
05:52:12.830 --> 05:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
seleckman for example to meet entirely
 
05:52:14.208 --> 05:52:14.218 align:start position:0%
remotely and that would dramatically
 
05:52:16.430 --> 05:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
change the participatory nature of local
 
05:52:18.830 --> 05:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
governance so
 
05:52:21.350 --> 05:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
I would say that this amendment makes it
 
05:52:22.850 --> 05:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
a little bit clearer that there's a
 
05:52:24.708 --> 05:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
reason that it's being applied only to
 
05:52:26.510 --> 05:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
the rare diseases Council but I will say
 
05:52:28.250 --> 05:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
that rights into New Hampshire is very
 
05:52:30.830 --> 05:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
aware of the difficulty that comes in
 
05:52:32.930 --> 05:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
enforcing something like 91a when you
 
05:52:35.270 --> 05:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
have discrete
 
05:52:35.280 --> 05:52:35.990 align:start position:0%
have discrete
um

05:52:35.990 --> 05:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:38.330 --> 05:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
changes to the law that apply in very
 
05:52:40.310 --> 05:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
specific cases and aren't applied
 
05:52:42.230 --> 05:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
broadly across the board consistently
 
05:52:44.208 --> 05:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
and transparently and I think that that
 
05:52:46.128 --> 05:52:46.138 align:start position:0%
would be an issue that our body would
 
05:52:47.690 --> 05:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
raise if I were to bring this amendment
 
05:52:49.730 --> 05:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
to them we will be talking about that on
 
05:52:49.740 --> 05:52:51.708 align:start position:0%
to them we will be talking about that on
Saturday

05:52:51.708 --> 05:52:51.718 align:start position:0%
Saturday
 
05:52:51.718 --> 05:52:52.970 align:start position:0%
Saturday
um

05:52:52.970 --> 05:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:55.010 --> 05:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
because of those changes I just want to
 
05:52:56.208 --> 05:52:56.218 align:start position:0%
take a look at this
 
05:52:56.218 --> 05:52:58.490 align:start position:0%
take a look at this
or

05:52:58.490 --> 05:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:53:00.048 --> 05:53:00.058 align:start position:0%
a couple of the other things that we
 
05:53:01.670 --> 05:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
think are important that virtual access
 
05:53:04.010 --> 05:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
should be provided and the information
 
05:53:06.110 --> 05:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
about that should be provided within the
 
05:53:07.330 --> 05:53:07.340 align:start position:0%
meeting notice
 
05:53:09.230 --> 05:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:53:12.288 --> 05:53:12.298 align:start position:0%
there should be a oh so and if during
 
05:53:14.150 --> 05:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
the meeting a member of the body informs
 
05:53:16.250 --> 05:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
the public body that there's process a
 
05:53:18.230 --> 05:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
problem with that access those problems
 
05:53:20.030 --> 05:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
should be stated in the minutes as well
 
05:53:21.890 --> 05:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
so that it's documented that there was
 
05:53:24.590 --> 05:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
an issue with somebody gaining access to
 
05:53:27.110 --> 05:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
it and those are a couple of pieces that
 
05:53:29.690 --> 05:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
right to know has identified as key to
 
05:53:31.310 --> 05:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
being able to put together truly
 
05:53:33.470 --> 05:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
accessible public publicly remote
 
05:53:36.830 --> 05:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
meetings so again like with 254 we would
 
05:53:38.448 --> 05:53:38.458 align:start position:0%
urge you today to oppose this bill is
 
05:53:40.610 --> 05:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate what we really
 
05:53:42.770 --> 05:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
need is an overarching guidance on
 
05:53:44.510 --> 05:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
remote meetings that applies across the
 
05:53:46.128 --> 05:53:46.138 align:start position:0%
board and if there needs to be a
 
05:53:47.750 --> 05:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
particular exception
 
05:53:49.910 --> 05:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
maybe to the Quorum requirement in the
 
05:53:51.890 --> 05:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
case of the rare diseases Council maybe
 
05:53:54.770 --> 05:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
that one piece could be something that's
 
05:53:56.448 --> 05:53:56.458 align:start position:0%
put out there as an alternative but
 
05:53:58.070 --> 05:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we would like to be able to
 
05:53:59.448 --> 05:53:59.458 align:start position:0%
have that conversation and put something
 
05:54:01.310 --> 05:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
that's more comprehensive together
 
05:54:04.490 --> 05:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
questions representative Tripp
 
05:54:04.500 --> 05:54:05.690 align:start position:0%
questions representative Tripp
uh

05:54:05.690 --> 05:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:54:08.650 --> 05:54:08.660 align:start position:0%
in uh being able to uh
 
05:54:11.330 --> 05:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
justify not attending the meeting
 
05:54:14.628 --> 05:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
somebody wants an exception one of the
 
05:54:17.930 --> 05:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
things that the uh the sponsor said was
 
05:54:19.850 --> 05:54:19.860 align:start position:0%
that well it's just too much bother for
 
05:54:22.128 --> 05:54:22.138 align:start position:0%
the for the doctor to drive two hours
 
05:54:24.288 --> 05:54:24.298 align:start position:0%
each way do you figure that that would
 
05:54:29.270 --> 05:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:31.970 --> 05:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
I think that that puts
 
05:54:35.090 --> 05:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
much of much of the volunteers that are
 
05:54:38.030 --> 05:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
involved in in supporting these kinds of
 
05:54:39.590 --> 05:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
bodies between a rock and a hard place
 
05:54:41.690 --> 05:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
we want them to participate we want to
 
05:54:44.448 --> 05:54:44.458 align:start position:0%
make that easier for them and we want
 
05:54:46.250 --> 05:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
their input I think we need to find a
 
05:54:47.868 --> 05:54:47.878 align:start position:0%
middle ground for them to be able to do
 
05:54:49.250 --> 05:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
it I
 
05:54:50.930 --> 05:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that is
 
05:54:53.330 --> 05:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
but I do think that it is important and
 
05:54:55.010 --> 05:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
right to know has stressed repeatedly
 
05:54:56.868 --> 05:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
when it comes to remote meetings that
 
05:54:59.150 --> 05:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a physical meeting
 
05:55:01.970 --> 05:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
location with a quorum in the room where
 
05:55:04.128 --> 05:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
the members of the public have the
 
05:55:06.530 --> 05:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
ability to interact with members of the
 
05:55:08.930 --> 05:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
public body as much as possible that
 
05:55:11.090 --> 05:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
interaction is important being able to
 
05:55:13.610 --> 05:55:13.620 align:start position:0%
read body language being able to see the
 
05:55:15.288 --> 05:55:15.298 align:start position:0%
screen not simply have someone be
 
05:55:17.448 --> 05:55:17.458 align:start position:0%
audible it's very different if I say to
 
05:55:19.610 --> 05:55:19.620 align:start position:0%
you I agree and roll my eyes than it is
 
05:55:21.650 --> 05:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
if if all you hear on the over the audio
 
05:55:23.690 --> 05:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
line is I agree
 
05:55:25.310 --> 05:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
all right other question yes
 
05:55:27.830 --> 05:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan
 
05:55:27.840 --> 05:55:28.548 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan
um

05:55:28.548 --> 05:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:30.288 --> 05:55:30.298 align:start position:0%
just on the other hand you're I mean
 
05:55:32.090 --> 05:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
you're very concerned about uh
 
05:55:34.070 --> 05:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
things being said which aren't on the
 
05:55:35.810 --> 05:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
official record but
 
05:55:37.548 --> 05:55:37.558 align:start position:0%
it's not also a problem with an
 
05:55:38.930 --> 05:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
in-person meeting people are having
 
05:55:41.150 --> 05:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
discussions that aren't you know like in
 
05:55:42.530 --> 05:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
front of the microphone or in the main
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
room and of course also
 
05:55:46.250 --> 05:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
this is as much right to know New
 
05:55:48.288 --> 05:55:48.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but other other groups have
 
05:55:50.150 --> 05:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
also been against remote meetings
 
05:55:51.410 --> 05:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
because that doesn't get a chance to
 
05:55:53.510 --> 05:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
physically confront the officials in
 
05:55:55.548 --> 05:55:55.558 align:start position:0%
person that certainly can lead to
 
05:55:57.650 --> 05:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
unofficial dialogue that's not part of
 
05:55:59.990 --> 05:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
the official programs question is there
 
05:56:01.670 --> 05:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
a question yeah
 
05:56:02.990 --> 05:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
so is
 
05:56:05.208 --> 05:56:05.218 align:start position:0%
so you feel like there's more more
 
05:56:09.048 --> 05:56:09.058 align:start position:0%
chance for like uh unauthorized off
 
05:56:11.690 --> 05:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
back Channel conversations in a zoom
 
05:56:13.128 --> 05:56:13.138 align:start position:0%
meeting than there is an in-person
 
05:56:13.138 --> 05:56:14.270 align:start position:0%
meeting than there is an in-person
meeting

05:56:14.270 --> 05:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:56:14.280 --> 05:56:16.310 align:start position:0%
meeting
so

05:56:16.310 --> 05:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:56:19.010 --> 05:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
I feel that if I'm sitting in this room
 
05:56:21.770 --> 05:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
and you all are in front of me I can see
 
05:56:23.448 --> 05:56:23.458 align:start position:0%
what the body language is between one
 
05:56:24.650 --> 05:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative and another
 
05:56:26.930 --> 05:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
representative I can tell that you guys
 
05:56:29.390 --> 05:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
aren't under your table texting at each
 
05:56:31.970 --> 05:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
other and even so there's there's a
 
05:56:33.430 --> 05:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
level of
 
05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
understanding the um the interaction
 
05:56:38.208 --> 05:56:38.218 align:start position:0%
that's happening do side conversations
 
05:56:40.490 --> 05:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
happen yes if there's side conversations
 
05:56:43.548 --> 05:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
that are happening over and zoom chat is
 
05:56:45.110 --> 05:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
one of those kind of sticking points
 
05:56:46.670 --> 05:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
with remote meetings they're happening
 
05:56:49.730 --> 05:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
on a publicly funded system for a public
 
05:56:51.770 --> 05:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
meeting where people are having side
 
05:56:53.930 --> 05:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
conversations then yeah those should be
 
05:56:55.430 --> 05:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
part of the public record if you step
 
05:56:56.868 --> 05:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
outside and speak with someone in the
 
05:57:00.770 --> 05:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
hallway that's that's a different thing
 
05:57:04.070 --> 05:57:04.080 align:start position:0%

representative Joshua Kella uh
 
05:58:33.708 --> 05:58:33.718 align:start position:0%
representing rocking M32 Fremont

05:58:40.548 --> 05:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
um I'm here introducing uh my bill HB
 
05:58:43.030 --> 05:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
321 which
 
05:58:47.810 --> 05:58:47.820 align:start position:0%
seeks to clarify the law or 91a
 
05:58:47.820 --> 05:58:49.490 align:start position:0%
seeks to clarify the law or 91a
regarding

05:58:49.490 --> 05:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
05:58:52.730 --> 05:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
um non-public meeting minutes and the
 
05:58:55.448 --> 05:58:55.458 align:start position:0%
kind of review process and how those get
 
05:58:58.310 --> 05:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
considered to be
 
05:58:58.320 --> 05:59:01.970 align:start position:0%
considered to be
um

05:59:01.970 --> 05:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:04.750 --> 05:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
subject to public disclosure
 
05:59:08.090 --> 05:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
right now the law
 
05:59:12.048 --> 05:59:12.058 align:start position:0%
as it is states that
 
05:59:14.570 --> 05:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
um these meeting minutes are subject to
 
05:59:16.490 --> 05:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
public disclosure
 
05:59:21.170 --> 05:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
um when the body finds that the uh
 
05:59:24.890 --> 05:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
that the conditions for which they were
 
05:59:27.350 --> 05:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
were kept from the public no longer
 
05:59:30.230 --> 05:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
apply and so that assumes that they're
 
05:59:34.430 --> 05:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
making some decision at some time to
 
05:59:34.440 --> 05:59:35.090 align:start position:0%
making some decision at some time to
um

05:59:35.090 --> 05:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:37.090 --> 05:59:37.100 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
05:59:40.190 --> 05:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
that that one that the conditions are
 
05:59:43.910 --> 05:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
not forever and two that they need to be
 
05:59:46.510 --> 05:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
reviewed so that they can um
 
05:59:50.090 --> 05:59:50.100 align:start position:0%
be subject to public disclosure
 
05:59:51.970 --> 05:59:51.980 align:start position:0%
and right now
 
05:59:56.750 --> 05:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh communities because there is
 
06:00:01.070 --> 06:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
no set guidance for how that occurs it
 
06:00:05.150 --> 06:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
has fallen by the wayside and that
 
06:00:07.910 --> 06:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
um especially for someone like me who is
 
06:00:10.070 --> 06:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
on a board but was not there when the
 
06:00:12.048 --> 06:00:12.058 align:start position:0%
board was
 
06:00:15.048 --> 06:00:15.058 align:start position:0%
um instituted I do not know all of the
 
06:00:17.470 --> 06:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
times that it went into public meeting
 
06:00:20.030 --> 06:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
non-public meetings and then sealed
 
06:00:23.110 --> 06:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
those minutes because prior to
 
06:00:26.330 --> 06:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
this year there was no list of those
 
06:00:27.548 --> 06:00:27.558 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes
 
06:00:31.070 --> 06:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
that have been sealed and so
 
06:00:33.410 --> 06:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
as a board member
 
06:00:36.170 --> 06:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
um trying to film fulfill my duties to
 
06:00:38.090 --> 06:00:38.100 align:start position:0%
ensure that the meeting minutes that are
 
06:00:41.090 --> 06:00:41.100 align:start position:0%
kept from the public are being reviewed
 
06:00:46.250 --> 06:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
and an unsealed win or subject to public
 
06:00:46.260 --> 06:00:47.690 align:start position:0%
and an unsealed win or subject to public
disclosure

06:00:47.690 --> 06:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
06:00:51.170 --> 06:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
um when appropriate is
 
06:00:51.180 --> 06:00:51.890 align:start position:0%
um when appropriate is
um

06:00:51.890 --> 06:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:51.900 --> 06:00:55.128 align:start position:0%
um
requires

06:00:55.128 --> 06:00:55.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:59.390 --> 06:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
some negotiation on the board because
 
06:01:01.970 --> 06:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
there is no clear
 
06:01:01.980 --> 06:01:03.850 align:start position:0%
there is no clear
um

06:01:03.850 --> 06:01:03.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:07.128 --> 06:01:07.138 align:start position:0%
empowerment by even individual board
 
06:01:09.170 --> 06:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
member to go and find those non-public
 
06:01:11.090 --> 06:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes
 
06:01:14.990 --> 06:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
um and review them and so
 
06:01:18.830 --> 06:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
what this uh Bill hopes to do is to
 
06:01:21.830 --> 06:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
create a kind of a guard rails and
 
06:01:25.010 --> 06:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
encourage boards to make a procedure for
 
06:01:25.020 --> 06:01:25.930 align:start position:0%
encourage boards to make a procedure for
this

06:01:25.930 --> 06:01:25.940 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:01:30.048 --> 06:01:30.058 align:start position:0%
so what the proposed language does is
 
06:01:33.890 --> 06:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
say that you can adopt a procedure that
 
06:01:38.930 --> 06:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
goes into the um this process for the
 
06:01:40.750 --> 06:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
regular review
 
06:01:43.548 --> 06:01:43.558 align:start position:0%
and to vote on the whether or not the
 
06:01:46.548 --> 06:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
circumstances no longer apply but if you
 
06:01:48.288 --> 06:01:48.298 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
06:01:48.298 --> 06:01:49.190 align:start position:0%
don't have
um

06:01:49.190 --> 06:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:49.200 --> 06:01:50.868 align:start position:0%
um
uh

06:01:50.868 --> 06:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:01:55.970 --> 06:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
such a procedure then it is uh the
 
06:01:58.730 --> 06:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
determination would be that every that
 
06:02:01.788 --> 06:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
you should review them every 10 years at
 
06:02:05.390 --> 06:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
least every 10 years and so that is kind
 
06:02:08.270 --> 06:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
of an outside like obviously you should
 
06:02:10.250 --> 06:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
probably review them more often than
 
06:02:12.470 --> 06:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
that but it's kind of just setting up
 
06:02:14.208 --> 06:02:14.218 align:start position:0%
guard rails and saying this is a
 
06:02:16.310 --> 06:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable a reason you can pick
 
06:02:17.930 --> 06:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
whatever time frame that you want one
 
06:02:20.510 --> 06:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
year two years five years seven years
 
06:02:22.610 --> 06:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
even 10 years
 
06:02:26.810 --> 06:02:26.820 align:start position:0%
um and that the the legislature views as
 
06:02:29.510 --> 06:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
a reasonable regular review but if
 
06:02:31.368 --> 06:02:31.378 align:start position:0%
you're doing it every 50 years that
 
06:02:33.410 --> 06:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily
 
06:02:33.420 --> 06:02:34.628 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily
um

06:02:34.628 --> 06:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:38.330 --> 06:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
constitute a regular review of these um
 
06:02:41.510 --> 06:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
sealed meaning minutes and so
 
06:02:46.730 --> 06:02:46.740 align:start position:0%
this uh this bill was uh worked with
 
06:02:49.670 --> 06:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
with in consultation with the right to
 
06:02:51.170 --> 06:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire and with the
 
06:02:53.330 --> 06:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
municipal Association because the
 
06:02:55.128 --> 06:02:55.138 align:start position:0%
municipal Association actually does
 
06:02:57.530 --> 06:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
encourage and recommend to the
 
06:03:00.530 --> 06:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
municipalities now that they have these
 
06:03:02.990 --> 06:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
regular reviews
 
06:03:06.170 --> 06:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
um but and they do encourage people to
 
06:03:09.470 --> 06:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
or they would like to encourage the um
 
06:03:11.628 --> 06:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
the legislature to be more clear about
 
06:03:13.970 --> 06:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
this issue and how this process should
 
06:03:16.250 --> 06:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
occur and so
 
06:03:20.030 --> 06:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
um that is why the impetus for this
 
06:03:20.040 --> 06:03:21.670 align:start position:0%
um that is why the impetus for this
legislation

06:03:21.670 --> 06:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:03:25.548 --> 06:03:25.558 align:start position:0%
came from so I'm happy to answer any
 
06:03:25.558 --> 06:03:28.368 align:start position:0%
came from so I'm happy to answer any
questions

06:03:28.368 --> 06:03:28.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:31.430 --> 06:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you so
 
06:03:33.590 --> 06:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in place now that says
 
06:03:36.470 --> 06:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
they have to review these at all and
 
06:03:39.410 --> 06:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:42.048 --> 06:03:42.058 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it is implied
 
06:03:46.270 --> 06:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
by the language of of 91a that that
 
06:03:50.810 --> 06:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
there would be a vote to determine
 
06:03:52.310 --> 06:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
whether the circumstances no longer
 
06:03:55.310 --> 06:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
apply but there is no guidance for a
 
06:03:58.670 --> 06:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
time frame or that any requirement that
 
06:04:02.150 --> 06:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
they have a process at all right now so
 
06:04:03.890 --> 06:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the Wild Wild West and so
 
06:04:05.530 --> 06:04:05.540 align:start position:0%
we're just falling by the wayside
 
06:04:09.890 --> 06:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
because it's not required
 
06:04:09.900 --> 06:04:15.430 align:start position:0%
because it's not required
foreign

06:04:15.430 --> 06:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:18.230 --> 06:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
why was the 10 years picked
 
06:04:21.890 --> 06:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh the question and as I
 
06:04:23.208 --> 06:04:23.218 align:start position:0%
was stating before
 
06:04:26.030 --> 06:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
um it was kind of the idea is that we
 
06:04:29.048 --> 06:04:29.058 align:start position:0%
don't want to be burdensen on the local
 
06:04:31.490 --> 06:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities and say you have to do it
 
06:04:33.230 --> 06:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
every single year otherwise it's going
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:04:36.230 --> 06:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
um because maybe they have a lot of
 
06:04:37.670 --> 06:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
minutes and they need a time to review
 
06:04:39.890 --> 06:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
them or whatever and
 
06:04:39.900 --> 06:04:40.670 align:start position:0%
them or whatever and
um

06:04:40.670 --> 06:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:44.510 --> 06:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh so it's kind of a discussion uh
 
06:04:46.010 --> 06:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
between right to know in New Hampshire
 
06:04:47.868 --> 06:04:47.878 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure would prefer it every
 
06:04:51.048 --> 06:04:51.058 align:start position:0%
year and even municipality in the nhma
 
06:04:54.770 --> 06:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
would encourage uh people these boards
 
06:04:57.470 --> 06:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
to do it every year but
 
06:05:01.128 --> 06:05:01.138 align:start position:0%
is that reasonable that every single
 
06:05:03.230 --> 06:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
board in the entire state
 
06:05:06.530 --> 06:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
have that same thing I think that's
 
06:05:08.868 --> 06:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit too strict
 
06:05:11.810 --> 06:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
um is five years too long maybe maybe
 
06:05:15.530 --> 06:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
not I was trying to just say what is a
 
06:05:18.410 --> 06:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time and and allow
 
06:05:21.650 --> 06:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
the municipalities to choose a time
 
06:05:23.628 --> 06:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
frame that makes sense for them
 
06:05:25.850 --> 06:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
as long as it's within this reasonable
 
06:05:28.490 --> 06:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
amount of time of 10 years but I'm
 
06:05:28.500 --> 06:05:29.810 align:start position:0%
amount of time of 10 years but I'm
obviously

06:05:29.810 --> 06:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
06:05:32.330 --> 06:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
I have sponsored a bill a few years ago
 
06:05:35.628 --> 06:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
that was very very much more strict and
 
06:05:39.288 --> 06:05:39.298 align:start position:0%
so it died and so I wanted to be more uh
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
inclusive to everyone's uh perspective
 
06:05:44.330 --> 06:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
on how regularly they could review this
 
06:05:44.340 --> 06:05:45.770 align:start position:0%
on how regularly they could review this
and

06:05:45.770 --> 06:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:05:47.930 --> 06:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
um not fall short of the law so thank
 
06:05:47.940 --> 06:05:54.830 align:start position:0%
um not fall short of the law so thank
you

06:05:54.830 --> 06:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:57.170 --> 06:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:05:58.730 --> 06:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:06:03.070 --> 06:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
I noticed at the end of the bill the
 
06:06:05.750 --> 06:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
judicial Department of Justice states
 
06:06:07.868 --> 06:06:07.878 align:start position:0%
there are a number of public bodies
 
06:06:10.610 --> 06:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
attached to the Department of Justice as
 
06:06:13.070 --> 06:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
this might create a burden
 
06:06:17.448 --> 06:06:17.458 align:start position:0%
also when it comes to municipalities and
 
06:06:20.390 --> 06:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
school districts etc etc is there any
 
06:06:22.868 --> 06:06:22.878 align:start position:0%
type of information available
 
06:06:25.310 --> 06:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
as to
 
06:06:28.970 --> 06:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
how often they seal records because like
 
06:06:31.190 --> 06:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
I know I go to my school district
 
06:06:34.070 --> 06:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
meetings school meetings every month I
 
06:06:36.470 --> 06:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
have them for about nine years now I've
 
06:06:39.410 --> 06:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
never known them to seal non-public
 
06:06:42.230 --> 06:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
so I was just curious
 
06:06:44.930 --> 06:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:06:44.940 --> 06:06:47.690 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

06:06:47.690 --> 06:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:50.090 --> 06:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
I believe that the you know Department
 
06:06:52.128 --> 06:06:52.138 align:start position:0%
of Justice needs to comply with 91a just
 
06:06:54.830 --> 06:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
like everyone else and so
 
06:06:59.030 --> 06:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
um if it's you know if the so the only
 
06:07:01.730 --> 06:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
people that are able to seal
 
06:07:06.288 --> 06:07:06.298 align:start position:0%
or or keep minutes from the public are
 
06:07:08.628 --> 06:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
are boards that
 
06:07:11.030 --> 06:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm not exactly sure what which
 
06:07:13.368 --> 06:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
boards are in the Department of Justice
 
06:07:16.010 --> 06:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
and and how often they're stealing stuff
 
06:07:17.930 --> 06:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
I don't there's no reason that they
 
06:07:20.930 --> 06:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
couldn't make a motion to see reseal all
 
06:07:24.410 --> 06:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
like a entire slate of meeting minutes
 
06:07:27.288 --> 06:07:27.298 align:start position:0%
in one motion so I'm not sure it would
 
06:07:29.330 --> 06:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
actually be
 
06:07:29.340 --> 06:07:30.288 align:start position:0%
actually be
um

06:07:30.288 --> 06:07:30.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:36.770 --> 06:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
i i a burden if they now under 91a
 
06:07:38.510 --> 06:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
um the recent change they have to create
 
06:07:41.390 --> 06:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
a list of the meeting minutes and so
 
06:07:43.070 --> 06:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
they already have a list so they know
 
06:07:45.948 --> 06:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
which meeting minutes need to be sealed
 
06:07:48.230 --> 06:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
and when they were last voted to be
 
06:07:50.930 --> 06:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
sealed and so they could just go to that
 
06:07:53.150 --> 06:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
list and say hey I would like to make a
 
06:07:54.948 --> 06:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
motion to see it reseal all these
 
06:07:57.530 --> 06:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
meaning minutes
 
06:07:59.930 --> 06:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
um and it would not take any specific
 
06:08:02.510 --> 06:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
you know length of time and so I'm I
 
06:08:03.770 --> 06:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
think that
 
06:08:07.128 --> 06:08:07.138 align:start position:0%
um I kind of discount that uh that it
 
06:08:09.288 --> 06:08:09.298 align:start position:0%
would cost a you know any particular
 
06:08:12.288 --> 06:08:12.298 align:start position:0%
board a large amount of time necessarily
 
06:08:14.448 --> 06:08:14.458 align:start position:0%
but I do think that they need to have a
 
06:08:17.030 --> 06:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
procedure for that and
 
06:08:19.070 --> 06:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
um as far as your other question as far
 
06:08:24.890 --> 06:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
as how often boards seal minutes it is
 
06:08:28.190 --> 06:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
different between each board and now
 
06:08:31.010 --> 06:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
that we have this requirement that they
 
06:08:34.610 --> 06:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
keep a list you may find that some
 
06:08:37.010 --> 06:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
boards like budget committee or zoning
 
06:08:39.530 --> 06:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
board don't do it
 
06:08:43.910 --> 06:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
ever and selectmin do it at every
 
06:08:47.868 --> 06:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
meeting and so it's you may you may um
 
06:08:50.930 --> 06:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
uh go to your local municipality and get
 
06:08:53.390 --> 06:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
that list and find out who is going into
 
06:08:55.670 --> 06:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
non-public and and sealing minutes and
 
06:08:58.190 --> 06:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
that will be uh the best probably way
 
06:09:01.010 --> 06:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
for you to know in your municipality
 
06:09:03.890 --> 06:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
whether who is utilizing that that
 
06:09:03.900 --> 06:09:06.830 align:start position:0%
whether who is utilizing that that
functionality

06:09:06.830 --> 06:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
functionality
 
06:09:10.448 --> 06:09:10.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:13.430 --> 06:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
I noticed in the title of your bell
 
06:09:15.948 --> 06:09:15.958 align:start position:0%
that it states meeting minutes not
 
06:09:17.750 --> 06:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
reviewed after 10 years shall be made
 
06:09:19.670 --> 06:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
public but then I don't actually see
 
06:09:22.730 --> 06:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
that in the bill and I was wondering
 
06:09:24.830 --> 06:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
if the intention wasn't to have that in
 
06:09:27.410 --> 06:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
there if that was a mistake
 
06:09:29.150 --> 06:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
and then I guess as a follow-up to that
 
06:09:31.548 --> 06:09:31.558 align:start position:0%
that if the intent was to have that in
 
06:09:31.558 --> 06:09:35.030 align:start position:0%
that if the intent was to have that in
there

06:09:35.030 --> 06:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:36.350 --> 06:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
um would you be amenable to adding
 
06:09:37.970 --> 06:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
something about unless otherwise
 
06:09:40.250 --> 06:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
unlawful for example I wouldn't want a
 
06:09:42.650 --> 06:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
school board meeting minutes relative to
 
06:09:45.548 --> 06:09:45.558 align:start position:0%
a specific child to be
 
06:09:47.810 --> 06:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
automatically released just because the
 
06:09:50.448 --> 06:09:50.458 align:start position:0%
school board hadn't had time to review
 
06:09:53.030 --> 06:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
well I thank you for the question I
 
06:09:55.490 --> 06:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
believe 10 years is plenty of time to
 
06:09:56.990 --> 06:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
review but
 
06:09:57.000 --> 06:09:57.850 align:start position:0%
review but
um

06:09:57.850 --> 06:09:57.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:00.948 --> 06:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
regarding your other statement about
 
06:10:02.510 --> 06:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
06:10:05.270 --> 06:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
um things would automatically be subject
 
06:10:07.070 --> 06:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
to public disclosure if they weren't
 
06:10:09.770 --> 06:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
following that that is specifically
 
06:10:13.430 --> 06:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
stated in line nine
 
06:10:13.440 --> 06:10:14.230 align:start position:0%
stated in line nine
um

06:10:14.230 --> 06:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:17.708 --> 06:10:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:20.868 --> 06:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh they need to vote to determine
 
06:10:23.750 --> 06:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh the circumstances no
 
06:10:25.128 --> 06:10:25.138 align:start position:0%
longer apply
 
06:10:27.830 --> 06:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
um more if if it's been more than 10
 
06:10:27.840 --> 06:10:29.150 align:start position:0%
um more if if it's been more than 10
years

06:10:29.150 --> 06:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:10:29.160 --> 06:10:29.990 align:start position:0%
years
um

06:10:29.990 --> 06:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:31.788 --> 06:10:31.798 align:start position:0%
otherwise they would be subject to
 
06:10:33.650 --> 06:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
public disclosure so they need to vote
 
06:10:36.190 --> 06:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
or it's automatically going to be
 
06:10:39.650 --> 06:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
subject to public disclosure and then
 
06:10:39.660 --> 06:10:40.368 align:start position:0%
subject to public disclosure and then
um

06:10:40.368 --> 06:10:40.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:46.548 --> 06:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
also I in in lines uh 9 through 12 I'm
 
06:10:47.990 --> 06:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
in I'm
 
06:10:51.650 --> 06:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
making sure that this becomes uh
 
06:10:54.048 --> 06:10:54.058 align:start position:0%
retroactive over the next 10 years that
 
06:10:56.628 --> 06:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
they have 10 years to review and find
 
06:11:00.730 --> 06:11:00.740 align:start position:0%
those minutes that they currently uh
 
06:11:03.830 --> 06:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
may not be part of a list or whatever so
 
06:11:06.170 --> 06:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
that they can go back have that time to
 
06:11:08.030 --> 06:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
gather the previous
 
06:11:08.040 --> 06:11:08.690 align:start position:0%
gather the previous
um

06:11:08.690 --> 06:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:11.390 --> 06:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes so that nothing is being
 
06:11:14.048 --> 06:11:14.058 align:start position:0%
like fallen through the cracks
 
06:11:16.910 --> 06:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Church
 
06:11:19.850 --> 06:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks representative
 
06:11:19.860 --> 06:11:21.350 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks representative
um

06:11:21.350 --> 06:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:23.448 --> 06:11:23.458 align:start position:0%
uh I guess I have two questions but let
 
06:11:25.010 --> 06:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
me let me start with one I think you
 
06:11:26.448 --> 06:11:26.458 align:start position:0%
clarified it
 
06:11:29.090 --> 06:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
um in in your previous answer
 
06:11:31.010 --> 06:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
um there's no specific requirement of
 
06:11:33.948 --> 06:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
what a review constitutes and
 
06:11:33.958 --> 06:11:34.730 align:start position:0%
what a review constitutes and
and

06:11:34.730 --> 06:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:11:37.548 --> 06:11:37.558 align:start position:0%
um it would be acceptable for a board to
 
06:11:39.590 --> 06:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
just make a decision that we're just
 
06:11:41.810 --> 06:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
keeping this sealed without doing any
 
06:11:45.230 --> 06:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
specific type of of examination of
 
06:11:47.948 --> 06:11:47.958 align:start position:0%
the contents is that is that your
 
06:11:50.690 --> 06:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
understanding or intent
 
06:11:53.570 --> 06:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:11:53.580 --> 06:11:54.350 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

06:11:54.350 --> 06:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:57.650 --> 06:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
my intention is not to micromanage the
 
06:12:00.650 --> 06:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
boards as to encourage them to have a
 
06:12:04.310 --> 06:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
process if when they review it it is
 
06:12:07.010 --> 06:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
inapprop in an appropriate inappropriate
 
06:12:10.190 --> 06:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
process then that will be done at a
 
06:12:12.110 --> 06:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
public meeting that is transparent to
 
06:12:14.690 --> 06:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
the public and therefore they can be
 
06:12:14.700 --> 06:12:15.890 align:start position:0%
the public and therefore they can be
voted

06:12:15.890 --> 06:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
voted
 
06:12:19.970 --> 06:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
um out if appropriate and so I I think
 
06:12:23.150 --> 06:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
that you know that they can have any
 
06:12:25.730 --> 06:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
review process if if it's appropriate
 
06:12:27.890 --> 06:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
that you have a giant list and you say
 
06:12:30.770 --> 06:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm motion that we reseal all
 
06:12:33.530 --> 06:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
of this that you know every every uh
 
06:12:35.570 --> 06:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes on this list for the
 
06:12:37.490 --> 06:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
next 10 years
 
06:12:40.610 --> 06:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
and that is appropriate for their uh you
 
06:12:42.650 --> 06:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
know their municipality I'm fine with
 
06:12:45.110 --> 06:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
that I don't I just want there to be a
 
06:12:47.750 --> 06:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
process in place so that it's that it's
 
06:12:47.760 --> 06:12:48.770 align:start position:0%
process in place so that it's that it's
happening

06:12:48.770 --> 06:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
happening
 
06:12:50.930 --> 06:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
can I ask one thing it's I don't know if
 
06:12:52.730 --> 06:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
it's a follow-up specific it may be a
 
06:12:54.890 --> 06:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
different question sure when when you're
 
06:12:56.288 --> 06:12:56.298 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
06:12:58.850 --> 06:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
uh voting on these minutes my
 
06:13:00.288 --> 06:13:00.298 align:start position:0%
understanding if you go into non-public
 
06:13:02.990 --> 06:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
you can discuss multiple non-public
 
06:13:06.230 --> 06:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
things in one in one session would it be
 
06:13:09.048 --> 06:13:09.058 align:start position:0%
possible this is Am I Wrong I'd be happy
 
06:13:12.288 --> 06:13:12.298 align:start position:0%
to be wrong on that I I thought that you
 
06:13:12.298 --> 06:13:13.368 align:start position:0%
to be wrong on that I I thought that you
could

06:13:13.368 --> 06:13:13.378 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:13:15.350 --> 06:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
do that and and I was curious whether or
 
06:13:17.510 --> 06:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
not you could unseal part of
 
06:13:20.390 --> 06:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
a set of minutes if some of it needed to
 
06:13:22.910 --> 06:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
stay and some of it didn't
 
06:13:25.610 --> 06:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I definitely
 
06:13:27.230 --> 06:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
think it's a different question
 
06:13:31.250 --> 06:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
um the the the the
 
06:13:31.260 --> 06:13:32.690 align:start position:0%
um the the the the
um

06:13:32.690 --> 06:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:36.048 --> 06:13:36.058 align:start position:0%
you can go into non-public so there's
 
06:13:38.330 --> 06:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
there's two kind of sections of law
 
06:13:40.610 --> 06:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
regarding non-public
 
06:13:42.948 --> 06:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
um and and the ceiling of non-public so
 
06:13:45.590 --> 06:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
there's there's uh
 
06:13:48.410 --> 06:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
the statement kind of in public session
 
06:13:50.510 --> 06:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
for the reasons why you're going into
 
06:13:53.868 --> 06:13:53.878 align:start position:0%
non-public session and then you could
 
06:13:56.930 --> 06:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
theoretically you could list whatever
 
06:14:00.350 --> 06:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
and however many of those that you want
 
06:14:02.690 --> 06:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
to be able to discuss in non-public and
 
06:14:04.910 --> 06:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
as long as they are covered under the
 
06:14:06.470 --> 06:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
non-public heading I don't think you
 
06:14:07.788 --> 06:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
have to come back out and go in for
 
06:14:10.250 --> 06:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
another discussion under a different
 
06:14:12.410 --> 06:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
topic I don't believe that that is the
 
06:14:15.110 --> 06:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
intention of or the practice of current
 
06:14:17.628 --> 06:14:17.638 align:start position:0%
law and then there's another part of the
 
06:14:21.048 --> 06:14:21.058 align:start position:0%
law that says that you can keep you make
 
06:14:23.448 --> 06:14:23.458 align:start position:0%
a determination after that after you've
 
06:14:25.190 --> 06:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
come out of non-public
 
06:14:27.708 --> 06:14:27.718 align:start position:0%
you need to make it you can make a
 
06:14:30.650 --> 06:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
determination about certain situations
 
06:14:33.170 --> 06:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
which is a delimited list of the entire
 
06:14:34.910 --> 06:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
list of the reasons why you go into
 
06:14:38.030 --> 06:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
non-public that allow you to keep the
 
06:14:41.090 --> 06:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes of that non-public sep
 
06:14:45.530 --> 06:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
from the public and so you so it's not
 
06:14:47.830 --> 06:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
exactly the same list
 
06:14:51.410 --> 06:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
of reasons that you can keep things from
 
06:14:53.208 --> 06:14:53.218 align:start position:0%
the public as that you can go into
 
06:14:55.548 --> 06:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
non-public those are two separate lists
 
06:14:57.830 --> 06:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:15:02.510 --> 06:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
so yes I guess there is
 
06:15:04.850 --> 06:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
um you can go in for multiple reasons I
 
06:15:08.030 --> 06:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
believe is my understanding and
 
06:15:11.750 --> 06:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
um however I don't know of
 
06:15:11.760 --> 06:15:13.430 align:start position:0%
um however I don't know of
uh

06:15:13.430 --> 06:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:15:16.190 --> 06:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
situation contemplated in the law where
 
06:15:18.350 --> 06:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
you would be able to unseal part of the
 
06:15:18.360 --> 06:15:19.788 align:start position:0%
you would be able to unseal part of the
minutes

06:15:19.788 --> 06:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
06:15:21.530 --> 06:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
of the non-public meeting minutes I
 
06:15:23.628 --> 06:15:23.638 align:start position:0%
think it just says you're either you've
 
06:15:25.250 --> 06:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
there's something in there that you
 
06:15:26.810 --> 06:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
don't want to disclose and therefore it
 
06:15:28.850 --> 06:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
needs to be kept from the public you
 
06:15:30.410 --> 06:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
have to just make it it's more of a
 
06:15:32.690 --> 06:15:32.700 align:start position:0%
binary Choice than a like line by line
 
06:15:34.730 --> 06:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
we're gonna you know strike out this
 
06:15:36.048 --> 06:15:36.058 align:start position:0%
line kind of a thing thank you
 
06:15:36.058 --> 06:15:38.150 align:start position:0%
line kind of a thing thank you
representative

06:15:38.150 --> 06:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:15:38.160 --> 06:15:41.690 align:start position:0%
representative
okay

06:15:41.690 --> 06:15:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:43.190 --> 06:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
06:15:44.930 --> 06:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
06:15:49.190 --> 06:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely is it true that uh the body
 
06:15:51.350 --> 06:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
has to be in public session before it
 
06:15:53.150 --> 06:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
can make a motion to go into non-public
 
06:15:56.570 --> 06:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
or one of the reasons in 91
 
06:16:00.770 --> 06:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
a colon 3 2 a through J and that they
 
06:16:02.750 --> 06:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
have to return to public sessions before
 
06:16:05.868 --> 06:16:05.878 align:start position:0%
they conceal the non the non-public
 
06:16:05.878 --> 06:16:07.730 align:start position:0%
they conceal the non the non-public
minutes

06:16:07.730 --> 06:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
06:16:07.740 --> 06:16:09.350 align:start position:0%
minutes
yes

06:16:09.350 --> 06:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:16:11.510 --> 06:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh do you feel that most boards are
 
06:16:14.570 --> 06:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
aware of this and and practice this
 
06:16:16.970 --> 06:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:16:18.350 --> 06:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
um whether or not they follow the law
 
06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
that is
 
06:16:22.548 --> 06:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
um I'm not aware of all of the
 
06:16:22.558 --> 06:16:24.110 align:start position:0%
um I'm not aware of all of the
municipalities

06:16:24.110 --> 06:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
06:16:24.120 --> 06:16:24.708 align:start position:0%
municipalities
um

06:16:24.708 --> 06:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:24.718 --> 06:16:26.030 align:start position:0%
um
uh

06:16:26.030 --> 06:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:16:28.970 --> 06:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
in their boards uh knowledge and
 
06:16:31.448 --> 06:16:31.458 align:start position:0%
practice of the lives
 
06:16:31.458 --> 06:16:33.170 align:start position:0%
practice of the lives
hopefully

06:16:33.170 --> 06:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
06:16:35.690 --> 06:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
they are
 
06:16:37.250 --> 06:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
other questions thank you for this week
 
06:16:38.990 --> 06:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative D Lorenzo thank you
 
06:16:41.030 --> 06:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
Mr there and thank you for taking my
 
06:16:43.310 --> 06:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
question representative yokella you know
 
06:16:45.410 --> 06:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm reading this
 
06:16:45.420 --> 06:16:45.948 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm reading this
um

06:16:45.948 --> 06:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:50.390 --> 06:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill and it sounds like
 
06:16:52.330 --> 06:16:52.340 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:16:55.788 --> 06:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
requires public bodies to release by
 
06:17:02.628 --> 06:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:05.750 --> 06:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:17:09.250 --> 06:17:09.260 align:start position:0%
um I think that that is a very broad
 
06:17:15.470 --> 06:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
statement and I do believe that even the
 
06:17:18.830 --> 06:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
CIA is not allowed to uh seal minutes
 
06:17:20.628 --> 06:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
indefinitely they can only seal minutes
 
06:17:22.670 --> 06:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
for like up to 75 years and then they
 
06:17:25.788 --> 06:17:25.798 align:start position:0%
have to review them again and reseal
 
06:17:28.548 --> 06:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
them and so you can't I don't believe
 
06:17:32.030 --> 06:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
that they're um that anything at the
 
06:17:35.270 --> 06:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
local level rises to the level of of you
 
06:17:37.548 --> 06:17:37.558 align:start position:0%
know National Secrets as far as that is
 
06:17:40.670 --> 06:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
concerned and so I don't believe that we
 
06:17:44.030 --> 06:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
should go you know as far as that so I
 
06:17:46.548 --> 06:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
do think that you know even you know who
 
06:17:49.788 --> 06:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
killed GF JFK might eventually become
 
06:17:52.128 --> 06:17:52.138 align:start position:0%
you know public record
 
06:17:56.150 --> 06:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
play it's all up yes so um
 
06:17:59.570 --> 06:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
and my thought is you know it's a 10
 
06:18:02.690 --> 06:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
year every 10-year process right who's
 
06:18:05.150 --> 06:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
going to remember 10 years from now that
 
06:18:06.948 --> 06:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
they have to um
 
06:18:10.610 --> 06:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:12.830 --> 06:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:18:15.470 --> 06:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
um as I stated before I definitely would
 
06:18:17.270 --> 06:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
encourage them to do a much more
 
06:18:21.730 --> 06:18:21.740 align:start position:0%
frequent basis however under the new law
 
06:18:25.190 --> 06:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
there is a unknown public meeting
 
06:18:27.890 --> 06:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
minutes on the list that is required to
 
06:18:32.750 --> 06:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
be kept it is it is said when it was the
 
06:18:34.910 --> 06:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
date of the meeting and when the date of
 
06:18:37.970 --> 06:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
the ceiling happened so there's going to
 
06:18:42.530 --> 06:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
be a list of so you would know
 
06:18:45.288 --> 06:18:45.298 align:start position:0%
other questions for this I'm sorry other
 
06:18:47.270 --> 06:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
06:18:48.590 --> 06:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much
 
06:18:50.930 --> 06:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
representative thank you representative
 
06:18:53.868 --> 06:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
Rebecca uh McWilliams
 
06:18:56.448 --> 06:18:56.458 align:start position:0%
or MC Willett
 
06:18:58.850 --> 06:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
Williams mcwillis I'm not sure
 
06:19:03.048 --> 06:19:03.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:05.570 --> 06:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
The Story of My Life Mick Williams M.C
 
06:19:17.208 --> 06:19:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:19.368 --> 06:19:19.378 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
06:19:20.570 --> 06:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
06:19:22.788 --> 06:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
Rebecca McWilliams I represent South
 
06:19:27.230 --> 06:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
Concord Wards 5678 you're sitting in one
 
06:19:29.390 --> 06:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to have you in my ward
 
06:19:31.250 --> 06:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming
 
06:19:33.288 --> 06:19:33.298 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to also support this very
 
06:19:36.170 --> 06:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
good bill this is a very small change
 
06:19:38.090 --> 06:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
but I think it's a very needed change
 
06:19:42.170 --> 06:19:42.180 align:start position:0%
just to clarify what otherwise the
 
06:19:44.570 --> 06:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
courts would have to clarify in terms of
 
06:19:46.970 --> 06:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
a reasonable period of time and so we're
 
06:19:49.070 --> 06:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
putting a number on it we're putting 10
 
06:19:51.110 --> 06:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
years that's a reasonable period of time
 
06:19:53.510 --> 06:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
so if you go 11 years that's an
 
06:19:55.250 --> 06:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
unreasonable period of time I think it's
 
06:19:56.330 --> 06:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
really important that we do that as
 
06:19:59.208 --> 06:19:59.218 align:start position:0%
legislators to put a pin in it if we
 
06:20:01.610 --> 06:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
don't it leaves things subjective and
 
06:20:03.590 --> 06:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
potentially subject to lawsuits where we
 
06:20:05.090 --> 06:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
all Dicker about it spend lots of money
 
06:20:06.770 --> 06:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
fighting over public meeting minutes in
 
06:20:07.970 --> 06:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
a court when
 
06:20:10.128 --> 06:20:10.138 align:start position:0%
we as legislators could simply put a
 
06:20:11.990 --> 06:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
number on it make it very clear so
 
06:20:13.490 --> 06:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons I support this
 
06:20:15.470 --> 06:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
bill I think we do need this bill
 
06:20:17.330 --> 06:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
um certainly there are all kinds of
 
06:20:19.250 --> 06:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
interesting Concord school meeting
 
06:20:21.048 --> 06:20:21.058 align:start position:0%
minutes that I would love to see at some
 
06:20:22.610 --> 06:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
point and so setting a 10-year clock
 
06:20:24.530 --> 06:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
from now for me personally and for my
 
06:20:27.288 --> 06:20:27.298 align:start position:0%
constituents would be a good thing
 
06:20:29.628 --> 06:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm I'm happy to answer
 
06:20:31.548 --> 06:20:31.558 align:start position:0%
questions but I'm here to say yes please
 
06:20:32.990 --> 06:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
put a pin in it
 
06:20:36.110 --> 06:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
06:20:40.430 --> 06:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:40.440 --> 06:20:41.690 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:20:41.690 --> 06:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:53.510 --> 06:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:55.430 --> 06:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you your honor
 
06:20:56.990 --> 06:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
and this will be the last time you have
 
06:20:58.788 --> 06:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
to hear from me today
 
06:21:00.590 --> 06:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
um right to know New Hampshire strongly
 
06:21:03.590 --> 06:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
supports HB 321 it requires a review
 
06:21:05.330 --> 06:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
process for minutes that are withheld
 
06:21:07.670 --> 06:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
from the public and this occurs under a
 
06:21:09.170 --> 06:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
process that's commonly referred to as
 
06:21:10.850 --> 06:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
sealing the minutes which can be done
 
06:21:13.250 --> 06:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
under any of three specific exemptions
 
06:21:14.750 --> 06:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
that apply to the contents of those
 
06:21:17.990 --> 06:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
minutes when that happens under 91a3
 
06:21:20.868 --> 06:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral three the law says
 
06:21:23.868 --> 06:21:23.878 align:start position:0%
information may be withheld until in the
 
06:21:25.730 --> 06:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
opinion of a majority of members the
 
06:21:29.390 --> 06:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
afore said circumstances no longer apply
 
06:21:33.110 --> 06:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
although 91a3 Roman numeral 3 implies
 
06:21:35.448 --> 06:21:35.458 align:start position:0%
the existence of a review process to
 
06:21:36.470 --> 06:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not those
 
06:21:38.750 --> 06:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances apply most towns do not
 
06:21:41.690 --> 06:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
have one the fact that the fact is that
 
06:21:43.490 --> 06:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
that there's no historical record of
 
06:21:45.530 --> 06:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
non-public minutes that were sealed and
 
06:21:47.448 --> 06:21:47.458 align:start position:0%
the reasons why further complicates and
 
06:21:49.548 --> 06:21:49.558 align:start position:0%
informs citizens ability to review
 
06:21:52.730 --> 06:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
potentially relevant materials a recent
 
06:21:55.190 --> 06:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
amendment to 91a that was mentioned by
 
06:21:57.590 --> 06:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative yokella now requires that
 
06:21:59.270 --> 06:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
listing of non-public minutes beginning
 
06:22:01.788 --> 06:22:01.798 align:start position:0%
in January of 2022 and has changed the
 
06:22:04.070 --> 06:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
process moving forward this is very much
 
06:22:06.350 --> 06:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
for the good but the historical record
 
06:22:08.628 --> 06:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
remains barred to public review and for
 
06:22:10.490 --> 06:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
the most part if the minutes were sealed
 
06:22:15.170 --> 06:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
in 2015 and 2005 or in 1995 they remain
 
06:22:17.628 --> 06:22:17.638 align:start position:0%
sealed and without review
 
06:22:19.970 --> 06:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
there was some questions from a few
 
06:22:22.670 --> 06:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
members of this group about what the
 
06:22:24.650 --> 06:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
practices are so I can speak to some of
 
06:22:27.410 --> 06:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
my experience until very recently the
 
06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
practice in my hometown of Milford seems
 
06:22:32.030 --> 06:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
to have been to consider almost every
 
06:22:34.430 --> 06:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
non-public session to result in sealed
 
06:22:36.288 --> 06:22:36.298 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes those meeting minutes
 
06:22:38.510 --> 06:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
were often sealed incorrectly on the
 
06:22:40.070 --> 06:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
basis of the reason for going into
 
06:22:42.170 --> 06:22:42.180 align:start position:0%
non-public session and not one of the
 
06:22:43.788 --> 06:22:43.798 align:start position:0%
three legal reasons that you actually
 
06:22:46.128 --> 06:22:46.138 align:start position:0%
are allowed to seal the minutes that has
 
06:22:48.048 --> 06:22:48.058 align:start position:0%
since been corrected in part because I
 
06:22:49.610 --> 06:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
have raised the issue and raised it very
 
06:22:49.620 --> 06:22:50.690 align:start position:0%
have raised the issue and raised it very
loudly

06:22:50.690 --> 06:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
loudly
 
06:22:53.390 --> 06:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
I have personally had the experience of
 
06:22:55.128 --> 06:22:55.138 align:start position:0%
combing through several years worth of
 
06:22:57.350 --> 06:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
past select board agendas to identify
 
06:22:59.628 --> 06:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
when those non-public sessions that had
 
06:23:01.850 --> 06:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
been scheduled may have occurred I then
 
06:23:03.590 --> 06:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
requested those minutes of the not
 
06:23:05.570 --> 06:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
scheduled non-public sessions and when I
 
06:23:06.890 --> 06:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
was told that certain minutes were
 
06:23:09.230 --> 06:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
sealed I asked that they'd be reviewed
 
06:23:11.810 --> 06:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
for possible unsealing I was told by
 
06:23:14.270 --> 06:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
administrative staff not the members of
 
06:23:17.510 --> 06:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
the public body that there was at that
 
06:23:19.548 --> 06:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
point no reason for the remaining ones
 
06:23:22.368 --> 06:23:22.378 align:start position:0%
to be unsealed at the time my request
 
06:23:24.350 --> 06:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
was not escalated to the board level for
 
06:23:26.510 --> 06:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
a review process
 
06:23:28.970 --> 06:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
after some back and forth I understand
 
06:23:30.890 --> 06:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
that they now have a review process
 
06:23:33.650 --> 06:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
mapped out but to my knowledge
 
06:23:35.750 --> 06:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
it has yet to take effect and applies
 
06:23:37.788 --> 06:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
primarily only to the prior Year's worth
 
06:23:39.830 --> 06:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
of minutes and I have not con but I have
 
06:23:41.270 --> 06:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
not confirmed all the details of that
 
06:23:43.070 --> 06:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
just yet I do not know what will happen
 
06:23:44.868 --> 06:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
when I begin asking for some of the
 
06:23:47.330 --> 06:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
older materials as background to one of
 
06:23:48.890 --> 06:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
the two or three key issues that I like
 
06:23:50.750 --> 06:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
to follow in my community
 
06:23:52.490 --> 06:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
this bill does not create an undue
 
06:23:54.410 --> 06:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
burden on a public body it provides
 
06:23:55.970 --> 06:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
considerable leeway by letting them
 
06:23:58.250 --> 06:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
determine what their own process is it
 
06:24:00.470 --> 06:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
sets a minimum threshold of time for
 
06:24:02.510 --> 06:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing and confirming the status of
 
06:24:04.910 --> 06:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
the sealed minutes moving forward and it
 
06:24:06.770 --> 06:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
gives an exceptionally long period of
 
06:24:09.110 --> 06:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
time for retroactive review of the
 
06:24:10.788 --> 06:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
historical record before making it
 
06:24:12.530 --> 06:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
mandatory to release unreviewed
 
06:24:14.570 --> 06:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
materials if the public body is
 
06:24:16.128 --> 06:24:16.138 align:start position:0%
concerned about information getting out
 
06:24:17.990 --> 06:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
that might be sensitive it now has an
 
06:24:20.510 --> 06:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
entire decade to decide how it wants to
 
06:24:21.830 --> 06:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
manage that and I know that
 
06:24:25.368 --> 06:24:25.378 align:start position:0%
representative yokella provided one sort
 
06:24:28.070 --> 06:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
of quicker way to try to deal with some
 
06:24:29.510 --> 06:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the issues I think part of the
 
06:24:31.128 --> 06:24:31.138 align:start position:0%
challenge will be
 
06:24:33.650 --> 06:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
the and the advantage to it will be that
 
06:24:35.270 --> 06:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
the communities will have to account for
 
06:24:37.610 --> 06:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
what minutes they currently have sealed
 
06:24:39.288 --> 06:24:39.298 align:start position:0%
that are not available to the public and
 
06:24:40.490 --> 06:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
they now have 10 years to figure that
 
06:24:40.500 --> 06:24:41.990 align:start position:0%
they now have 10 years to figure that
out

06:24:41.990 --> 06:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:24:44.150 --> 06:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
the bill also does not require or create
 
06:24:46.670 --> 06:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
a new requirement under 91a3 public
 
06:24:48.590 --> 06:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
bodies should routinely be reviewing
 
06:24:50.030 --> 06:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
their minutes for information that may
 
06:24:51.830 --> 06:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
be opened up to the public it simply
 
06:24:53.990 --> 06:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't been happening because 91a
 
06:24:56.030 --> 06:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify any requirements around
 
06:24:58.510 --> 06:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
that activity this language essentially
 
06:25:01.430 --> 06:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
operationalizes an existing requirement
 
06:25:03.350 --> 06:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
by doing so it's meeting its
 
06:25:05.448 --> 06:25:05.458 align:start position:0%
responsibility to only withhold
 
06:25:07.548 --> 06:25:07.558 align:start position:0%
information for as long as necessary and
 
06:25:09.230 --> 06:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
the public itself will gain access and
 
06:25:12.708 --> 06:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
informed insight into its own history
 
06:25:14.448 --> 06:25:14.458 align:start position:0%
questions for them to take questions
 
06:25:15.890 --> 06:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:25:18.350 --> 06:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tripp thank you chair
 
06:25:21.470 --> 06:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh I'm
 
06:25:23.750 --> 06:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
sure you heard me ask representative
 
06:25:26.990 --> 06:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
yukela uh if he thought that the the
 
06:25:30.948 --> 06:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
boards follow uh or are even aware of
 
06:25:35.208 --> 06:25:35.218 align:start position:0%
the requirements of RSA 91a
 
06:25:38.510 --> 06:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that the boards do the best
 
06:25:39.948 --> 06:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
that they can to navigate those
 
06:25:41.750 --> 06:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
requirements I think there is a
 
06:25:43.788 --> 06:25:43.798 align:start position:0%
tremendous need for Education around
 
06:25:46.788 --> 06:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
what is really involved my board was
 
06:25:49.490 --> 06:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
coming out of non-public and was not
 
06:25:51.170 --> 06:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
doing the additional step that you said
 
06:25:52.910 --> 06:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
about taking that vote in public but
 
06:25:54.470 --> 06:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
once it was made clear that that needed
 
06:25:56.270 --> 06:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
to happen and that they need to provide
 
06:25:58.128 --> 06:25:58.138 align:start position:0%
the reason for stealing the minutes when
 
06:26:00.530 --> 06:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
they decide to do that they've now
 
06:26:02.350 --> 06:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
started to do that
 
06:26:04.910 --> 06:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
there's a huge need for Education around
 
06:26:06.470 --> 06:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
this at the local level
 
06:26:10.128 --> 06:26:10.138 align:start position:0%
follow-up question please yes uh are you
 
06:26:12.288 --> 06:26:12.298 align:start position:0%
aware that the land use boards had to
 
06:26:14.510 --> 06:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
get annual training
 
06:26:16.610 --> 06:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
you probably not
 
06:26:19.310 --> 06:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
not specifically the land use boards but
 
06:26:20.990 --> 06:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
I do believe I've seen something related
 
06:26:25.128 --> 06:26:25.138 align:start position:0%
to other other boards yes one more yep
 
06:26:28.970 --> 06:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
do you think that maybe uh it would be a
 
06:26:32.830 --> 06:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
good idea to amend the bill to put uh
 
06:26:39.170 --> 06:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a training annual in this bill
 
06:26:40.430 --> 06:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
06:26:42.230 --> 06:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp I should have been
 
06:26:43.610 --> 06:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
thanking all of you for your questions
 
06:26:45.890 --> 06:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
all along too I apologize this is my
 
06:26:47.330 --> 06:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
first time testifying on behalf of the
 
06:26:47.340 --> 06:26:48.948 align:start position:0%
first time testifying on behalf of the
organization

06:26:48.948 --> 06:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
organization
 
06:26:48.958 --> 06:26:49.548 align:start position:0%
organization
um

06:26:49.548 --> 06:26:49.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:52.430 --> 06:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely I feel that not only should
 
06:26:55.010 --> 06:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
local elected officials be trained in
 
06:26:57.288 --> 06:26:57.298 align:start position:0%
91a effectively and that that is a lack
 
06:26:59.330 --> 06:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
in my local community that I have tried
 
06:27:02.030 --> 06:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
to push them to remedy but that also the
 
06:27:03.890 --> 06:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
administrative staff should be trained
 
06:27:06.410 --> 06:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
as well because most of the time they
 
06:27:10.128 --> 06:27:10.138 align:start position:0%
are not I was in court with my town and
 
06:27:13.610 --> 06:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
our town not administer executive
 
06:27:16.430 --> 06:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
administrator admitted that she had had
 
06:27:19.368 --> 06:27:19.378 align:start position:0%
no training prior to she had been
 
06:27:21.590 --> 06:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
advised by legal counsel as to what to
 
06:27:25.368 --> 06:27:25.378 align:start position:0%
do and actually stated that after after
 
06:27:29.448 --> 06:27:29.458 align:start position:0%
being advised by legal counsel and then
 
06:27:30.890 --> 06:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
um we hired a different legal counsel
 
06:27:31.970 --> 06:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
she's since learned that that was
 
06:27:34.010 --> 06:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
incorrect so the accountability and and
 
06:27:35.868 --> 06:27:35.878 align:start position:0%
being able to have people trained and
 
06:27:37.548 --> 06:27:37.558 align:start position:0%
understand what they need to do is is
 
06:27:37.558 --> 06:27:39.650 align:start position:0%
understand what they need to do is is
tremendous

06:27:39.650 --> 06:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
tremendous
 
06:27:42.170 --> 06:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
06:27:42.180 --> 06:27:43.610 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
Witness

06:27:43.610 --> 06:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
06:27:46.310 --> 06:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much oh I'm
 
06:27:48.110 --> 06:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
sure I'm sorry representative Stapleton
 
06:27:50.390 --> 06:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
06:27:52.610 --> 06:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:27:54.590 --> 06:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's what you what you announced
 
06:27:56.390 --> 06:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
sounded like a rather
 
06:27:59.868 --> 06:27:59.878 align:start position:0%
um circular administrative obfuscation
 
06:28:03.410 --> 06:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
um the the minutes are sealed and we see
 
06:28:05.510 --> 06:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
no reason to unseal them
 
06:28:08.270 --> 06:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
well what files what follows from there
 
06:28:10.670 --> 06:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
can you make a request to the board or
 
06:28:12.048 --> 06:28:12.058 align:start position:0%
the council
 
06:28:14.390 --> 06:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
put it on the agenda for a review of
 
06:28:16.850 --> 06:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
those minutes in absence of the law what
 
06:28:20.330 --> 06:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
could you do now right so so if I had
 
06:28:22.670 --> 06:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
chosen to pursue that particular issue
 
06:28:25.670 --> 06:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
which at the time I did not I could have
 
06:28:27.948 --> 06:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
brought it to the board and asked them
 
06:28:29.628 --> 06:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
to please put it on the agenda you are
 
06:28:31.610 --> 06:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
correct however there were other issues
 
06:28:33.708 --> 06:28:33.718 align:start position:0%
involved in those minutes and we did end
 
06:28:35.270 --> 06:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
up in court having some of those minutes
 
06:28:37.128 --> 06:28:37.138 align:start position:0%
reviewed in camera to determine whether
 
06:28:39.288 --> 06:28:39.298 align:start position:0%
or not they should be released so the
 
06:28:41.390 --> 06:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
review process was secondary to what my
 
06:28:44.570 --> 06:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
initial objective was at the time thank
 
06:28:47.570 --> 06:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
you yep other questions for this Witness
 
06:28:49.788 --> 06:28:49.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
06:28:51.948 --> 06:28:51.958 align:start position:0%
you you know and I'm sorry we've gone
 
06:28:54.048 --> 06:28:54.058 align:start position:0%
through no no I'm I was just going to
 
06:28:55.548 --> 06:28:55.558 align:start position:0%
make an announcement I've we've gone
 
06:28:57.948 --> 06:28:57.958 align:start position:0%
through so many Margaret Burns have you
 
06:29:00.190 --> 06:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
already testified or
 
06:29:02.390 --> 06:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
and if you haven't then we want to hear
 
06:29:07.128 --> 06:29:07.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:09.470 --> 06:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
you feel like I've already testified and
 
06:29:11.270 --> 06:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
I understand why
 
06:29:12.470 --> 06:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm Margaret Burns of the New
 
06:29:14.150 --> 06:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and we
 
06:29:16.850 --> 06:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
are here in support of house bill 321.
 
06:29:20.030 --> 06:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
we believe that house bill 321 clarifies
 
06:29:26.330 --> 06:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
existing law so RSA 91a3 implies that
 
06:29:28.368 --> 06:29:28.378 align:start position:0%
public bodies are supposed to do some
 
06:29:30.830 --> 06:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
sort of review of non-public session
 
06:29:33.230 --> 06:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
minutes to determine whether the reason
 
06:29:35.150 --> 06:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
they were sealed in the first place
 
06:29:38.868 --> 06:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
still applies but it gives no real
 
06:29:41.150 --> 06:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
guidance on that or says anything
 
06:29:44.030 --> 06:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
further about what that means and what
 
06:29:45.948 --> 06:29:45.958 align:start position:0%
public bodies should do in order to be
 
06:29:49.730 --> 06:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
in compliance with that in RSA 91a3 so
 
06:29:52.310 --> 06:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
the first sentence of House Bill 321
 
06:29:54.650 --> 06:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
would do something we think public
 
06:29:57.110 --> 06:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
bodies already should do and have the
 
06:29:59.030 --> 06:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
ability to do but it would clarify that
 
06:30:01.788 --> 06:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
by stating that they can adopt a policy
 
06:30:04.430 --> 06:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
or a protocol to do this kind of review
 
06:30:06.170 --> 06:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
and determine if non-public session
 
06:30:08.628 --> 06:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
minutes should be made public or if the
 
06:30:10.548 --> 06:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
reason for their ceiling should remain
 
06:30:13.490 --> 06:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
and then the remaining sentences of this
 
06:30:15.830 --> 06:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
particular bill would put in place sort
 
06:30:17.990 --> 06:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
of a baseline or a fallback if a public
 
06:30:20.930 --> 06:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
body does not put in place a process so
 
06:30:22.850 --> 06:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
that there is some sort of standard for
 
06:30:22.860 --> 06:30:23.830 align:start position:0%
that there is some sort of standard for
review

06:30:23.830 --> 06:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
review
 
06:30:28.010 --> 06:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
and making non-public session minutes
 
06:30:30.890 --> 06:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
public I I do appreciate the question
 
06:30:34.250 --> 06:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
that was asked earlier about the last
 
06:30:37.250 --> 06:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
sentence of the bill which says if the
 
06:30:39.590 --> 06:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
review is not done within 10 years then
 
06:30:41.270 --> 06:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
those non-public session minutes will
 
06:30:44.570 --> 06:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
become automatically public I suppose
 
06:30:47.030 --> 06:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
there could be a scenario where I think
 
06:30:49.070 --> 06:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
the example given was was a student type
 
06:30:52.128 --> 06:30:52.138 align:start position:0%
situation or some other highly sensitive
 
06:30:54.650 --> 06:30:54.660 align:start position:0%
situation and we would not want to
 
06:30:58.548 --> 06:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
penalize the subject of the minutes by
 
06:31:00.350 --> 06:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
making those non-public session minutes
 
06:31:02.930 --> 06:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
automatically available just because the
 
06:31:05.330 --> 06:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
public body did not do its
 
06:31:07.250 --> 06:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility of reviewing those
 
06:31:09.530 --> 06:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
non-public session minutes
 
06:31:13.010 --> 06:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
um that's a potentially narrow situation
 
06:31:16.670 --> 06:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
that could happen from passage of this
 
06:31:16.680 --> 06:31:17.628 align:start position:0%
that could happen from passage of this
bill

06:31:17.628 --> 06:31:17.638 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:31:19.490 --> 06:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
there was also a question earlier I just
 
06:31:21.948 --> 06:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to try to address about how
 
06:31:23.810 --> 06:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
boards are support public bodies and
 
06:31:26.030 --> 06:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
boards are supposed to decide whether
 
06:31:28.190 --> 06:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
minutes should continue to be withheld
 
06:31:30.830 --> 06:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
from the public Our advice has always
 
06:31:33.288 --> 06:31:33.298 align:start position:0%
been that when they do a review of
 
06:31:35.570 --> 06:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
non-public session minutes they need to
 
06:31:37.670 --> 06:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
determine whether the circumstances
 
06:31:40.430 --> 06:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
under which they were sealed still apply
 
06:31:43.070 --> 06:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
so as referenced earlier there are only
 
06:31:45.170 --> 06:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
a few specific reasons for which
 
06:31:47.330 --> 06:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
non-public session minutes can actually
 
06:31:50.570 --> 06:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
be so-called sealed and when the public
 
06:31:53.030 --> 06:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
body is doing that review if those
 
06:31:55.070 --> 06:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances still apply then the
 
06:31:57.048 --> 06:31:57.058 align:start position:0%
non-public session minutes can remain
 
06:31:59.330 --> 06:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
non-public but if the circumstances no
 
06:32:00.948 --> 06:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
longer apply then there would not be a
 
06:32:02.690 --> 06:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
valid reason for those non-public
 
06:32:05.628 --> 06:32:05.638 align:start position:0%
session minutes to remain not public and
 
06:32:08.448 --> 06:32:08.458 align:start position:0%
as representative yokella said nhma has
 
06:32:11.510 --> 06:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
been advising public bodies to adopt a
 
06:32:13.730 --> 06:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
process for reviewing and sealing
 
06:32:15.650 --> 06:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
unsealing or at least reviewing
 
06:32:17.990 --> 06:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
non-public sessions for years and it's
 
06:32:19.730 --> 06:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
included in our book on the right to no
 
06:32:21.230 --> 06:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
law as well as our trainings on the
 
06:32:23.270 --> 06:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
right to know law so we hope that this
 
06:32:25.910 --> 06:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
will help clarify if passed thank you
 
06:32:28.010 --> 06:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Alexander
 
06:32:29.270 --> 06:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:32:31.010 --> 06:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
Margaret for um answering Ms Burns for
 
06:32:32.208 --> 06:32:32.218 align:start position:0%
answering my question
 
06:32:34.730 --> 06:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
um so is it my understanding that nhma
 
06:32:37.070 --> 06:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
um conducts annual training
 
06:32:39.048 --> 06:32:39.058 align:start position:0%
um with their members to make sure that
 
06:32:41.628 --> 06:32:41.638 align:start position:0%
all local boards are up to date on what
 
06:32:44.208 --> 06:32:44.218 align:start position:0%
the current laws are so that they would
 
06:32:46.010 --> 06:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
understand that if there was you know
 
06:32:47.868 --> 06:32:47.878 align:start position:0%
minutes in there for 10 years they would
 
06:32:49.010 --> 06:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
know that they'd have to vote to seal
 
06:32:50.570 --> 06:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
them or not and you currently keep them
 
06:32:52.368 --> 06:32:52.378 align:start position:0%
up to date on laws that are passed by
 
06:32:54.470 --> 06:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
the general court yes we conduct
 
06:32:57.170 --> 06:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
multiple annual trainings on the right
 
06:32:58.730 --> 06:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
to know law it's our most popular
 
06:33:01.128 --> 06:33:01.138 align:start position:0%
subject and are probably our most needed
 
06:33:03.650 --> 06:33:03.660 align:start position:0%
subject and we also try to do a training
 
06:33:05.208 --> 06:33:05.218 align:start position:0%
shortly after the end of the legislative
 
06:33:07.368 --> 06:33:07.378 align:start position:0%
session specifically on the right to
 
06:33:08.930 --> 06:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
know law to make sure they know what's
 
06:33:10.548 --> 06:33:10.558 align:start position:0%
been passed because sometimes there can
 
06:33:11.990 --> 06:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
be a very small change to the right to
 
06:33:13.970 --> 06:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
no law that can have a big impact on the
 
06:33:16.250 --> 06:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
way that they're operating and it's very
 
06:33:18.530 --> 06:33:18.540 align:start position:0%
hard for local officials to keep up to
 
06:33:20.030 --> 06:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
date on their own with changes that
 
06:33:21.770 --> 06:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
happen at the legislature
 
06:33:23.570 --> 06:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness yes
 
06:33:25.850 --> 06:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp thank you Mr chair
 
06:33:28.430 --> 06:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:33:30.230 --> 06:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
do you provide this training to school
 
06:33:32.810 --> 06:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
board members school boards cannot be
 
06:33:36.410 --> 06:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
members of nhma our bylaws allow cities
 
06:33:38.208 --> 06:33:38.218 align:start position:0%
towns Village districts Regional
 
06:33:39.948 --> 06:33:39.958 align:start position:0%
planning commissions and counties to be
 
06:33:42.350 --> 06:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
members of nhma there is a separate
 
06:33:45.048 --> 06:33:45.058 align:start position:0%
Association just like us but for schools
 
06:33:46.190 --> 06:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school boards
 
06:33:48.230 --> 06:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
Association and they do provide right to
 
06:33:50.448 --> 06:33:50.458 align:start position:0%
no law training
 
06:33:53.390 --> 06:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised thank you other questions
 
06:33:55.670 --> 06:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
06:33:58.430 --> 06:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
06:34:00.948 --> 06:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
and may I ask you is there anyone else
 
06:34:06.948 --> 06:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
here who wishes to testify on HB 321
 
06:34:09.288 --> 06:34:09.298 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the hearing on
 
06:34:13.490 --> 06:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
HB 321 and I will turn the chair over to
 
06:34:16.670 --> 06:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace because I'm a I'm
 
06:34:21.470 --> 06:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:21.480 --> 06:34:26.690 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:34:26.690 --> 06:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:26.700 --> 06:34:36.830 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:34:36.830 --> 06:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:38.750 --> 06:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll now open the public hearing on
 
06:34:41.570 --> 06:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
House Bill 347 FN
 
06:34:44.570 --> 06:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
and representative Lynn you've got the
 
06:34:46.070 --> 06:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
floor but I will need a pink card
 
06:34:48.770 --> 06:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
afterwards oh of course yes I will get
 
06:34:51.590 --> 06:34:51.600 align:start position:0%

review docket
um

06:35:08.810 --> 06:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:10.310 --> 06:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:35:12.708 --> 06:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
um there was a similar bill that was
 
06:35:12.718 --> 06:35:13.850 align:start position:0%
um there was a similar bill that was
introduced

06:35:13.850 --> 06:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
06:35:17.570 --> 06:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
um last term by me I believe I mean it
 
06:35:19.788 --> 06:35:19.798 align:start position:0%
didn't I believe it went to uh interim
 
06:35:22.010 --> 06:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
study if I'm not if I'm not mistaken
 
06:35:23.208 --> 06:35:23.218 align:start position:0%
representative I think it went to
 
06:35:24.770 --> 06:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
interim study but I could be wrong on
 
06:35:26.868 --> 06:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
that it went to interim study I believe
 
06:35:28.490 --> 06:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
at your request
 
06:35:31.128 --> 06:35:31.138 align:start position:0%
was it at my request well I didn't think
 
06:35:33.470 --> 06:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
it was but but yet you might maybe
 
06:35:34.970 --> 06:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
something came up that that I didn't
 
06:35:36.890 --> 06:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
that I'm not remembering now but I
 
06:35:42.490 --> 06:35:42.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:44.990 --> 06:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure your memory is more maybe it
 
06:35:47.288 --> 06:35:47.298 align:start position:0%
was one of your other bills
 
06:35:50.150 --> 06:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
it might have been yeah and yes in fact
 
06:35:52.070 --> 06:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
I think I'll I'll talk to you about that
 
06:35:54.708 --> 06:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
I think it was but anyway
 
06:35:56.510 --> 06:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
um this really this bill would authorize
 
06:35:58.910 --> 06:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
the creation of a superior court uh land
 
06:36:00.770 --> 06:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
you stock it
 
06:36:04.310 --> 06:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
um the jurisdiction of that docket would
 
06:36:07.730 --> 06:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
be all land use appeals from local land
 
06:36:09.890 --> 06:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
use ports and you'll notice that in the
 
06:36:12.350 --> 06:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
bill uh there's a there's a specific
 
06:36:15.170 --> 06:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
provision it says it does not the the
 
06:36:17.030 --> 06:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the docket would not
 
06:36:20.448 --> 06:36:20.458 align:start position:0%
cover appeals from State agencies even
 
06:36:22.070 --> 06:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
if they could be considered in some
 
06:36:24.430 --> 06:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
sense land use
 
06:36:27.170 --> 06:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
even if they have some land use Jersey
 
06:36:30.230 --> 06:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
so for example appeal from the uh
 
06:36:32.390 --> 06:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services as
 
06:36:35.750 --> 06:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
an example would not uh be subject to
 
06:36:37.850 --> 06:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
the land you stock and it's it's limited
 
06:36:39.948 --> 06:36:39.958 align:start position:0%
to uh Municipal
 
06:36:39.958 --> 06:36:40.628 align:start position:0%
to uh Municipal
um

06:36:40.628 --> 06:36:40.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:43.690 --> 06:36:43.700 align:start position:0%
uh land use
 
06:36:43.700 --> 06:36:45.548 align:start position:0%
uh land use
agencies

06:36:45.548 --> 06:36:45.558 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
06:36:48.948 --> 06:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
it proposes that the governor uh with
 
06:36:50.868 --> 06:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
and Council would appoint the first
 
06:36:55.310 --> 06:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Superior Court uh that
 
06:36:57.530 --> 06:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
would handle that would be assigned to
 
06:37:00.230 --> 06:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
that docket uh who must be a person that
 
06:37:03.350 --> 06:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
is knowledgeable in land use and
 
06:37:05.750 --> 06:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
property law and that it would give the
 
06:37:08.990 --> 06:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice of the Superior Court
 
06:37:11.090 --> 06:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
um the if it turned out that more than
 
06:37:13.368 --> 06:37:13.378 align:start position:0%
one Justice was needed for that for to
 
06:37:16.010 --> 06:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
to manage the docket the Chief Justice
 
06:37:17.390 --> 06:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
of the Superior Court would have the
 
06:37:20.330 --> 06:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
authority to assign other Superior Court
 
06:37:24.048 --> 06:37:24.058 align:start position:0%
judges to uh the docket
 
06:37:24.058 --> 06:37:24.948 align:start position:0%
judges to uh the docket
um

06:37:24.948 --> 06:37:24.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:27.530 --> 06:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
the other thing I would note here and
 
06:37:28.910 --> 06:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there may be questions about
 
06:37:32.030 --> 06:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
this one which I'm happy to address is
 
06:37:34.070 --> 06:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
um as you I'm all uh I'm sure are all
 
06:37:37.970 --> 06:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
aware we uh in 2019 the legislature
 
06:37:41.030 --> 06:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
created the housing appeals board
 
06:37:44.810 --> 06:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that this uh that
 
06:37:46.850 --> 06:37:46.860 align:start position:0%
the docket of this proposed Superior
 
06:37:48.708 --> 06:37:48.718 align:start position:0%
Court land use socket would not be
 
06:37:51.410 --> 06:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
limited to housing appeals in other
 
06:37:53.990 --> 06:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
words the housing appeals board is only
 
06:37:56.510 --> 06:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
concerned with housing development so if
 
06:37:58.548 --> 06:37:58.558 align:start position:0%
there's a commercial somebody wants to
 
06:38:00.288 --> 06:38:00.298 align:start position:0%
you know put in a new commercial
 
06:38:02.510 --> 06:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
building somewhere the housing appeal
 
06:38:04.788 --> 06:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
board now under current law does not
 
06:38:06.948 --> 06:38:06.958 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction over that it just goes
 
06:38:08.868 --> 06:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
to the regular Superior Court appeals
 
06:38:11.930 --> 06:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
process this Superior Court land use
 
06:38:14.330 --> 06:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
docket would cover all land use appeals
 
06:38:16.788 --> 06:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
whether it was commercial development or
 
06:38:19.548 --> 06:38:19.558 align:start position:0%
housing develop
 
06:38:23.030 --> 06:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the docket is to
 
06:38:23.040 --> 06:38:24.368 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the docket is to
consolidate

06:38:24.368 --> 06:38:24.378 align:start position:0%
consolidate
 
06:38:27.770 --> 06:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
all cases involving land use matters
 
06:38:32.270 --> 06:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
before a single judge who is somebody
 
06:38:34.548 --> 06:38:34.558 align:start position:0%
that's knowledgeable in that area who
 
06:38:38.470 --> 06:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
would devote his or her time
 
06:38:41.390 --> 06:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
exclusively if necessary but certainly
 
06:38:45.650 --> 06:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
substantially to hearing these cases and
 
06:38:48.948 --> 06:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
the idea would be to speed up the
 
06:38:51.230 --> 06:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
process to ensure sort of more
 
06:38:51.240 --> 06:38:52.970 align:start position:0%
process to ensure sort of more
consistency

06:38:52.970 --> 06:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
consistency
 
06:38:52.980 --> 06:38:53.868 align:start position:0%
consistency
um

06:38:53.868 --> 06:38:53.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:56.390 --> 06:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh which is really kind of important as
 
06:38:58.730 --> 06:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
I think we all know we have uh there is
 
06:39:02.510 --> 06:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
a housing uh housing shortage in New
 
06:39:04.250 --> 06:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh particularly a housing
 
06:39:06.590 --> 06:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
shortage for affordable housing and this
 
06:39:10.430 --> 06:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
is designed uh to one of the things that
 
06:39:10.440 --> 06:39:11.690 align:start position:0%
is designed uh to one of the things that
that

06:39:11.690 --> 06:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:39:14.390 --> 06:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
um we hear a lot is that
 
06:39:18.890 --> 06:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
um developers uh are discouraged because
 
06:39:21.650 --> 06:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
the process that that
 
06:39:24.230 --> 06:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
um currently exists if you need to
 
06:39:27.850 --> 06:39:27.860 align:start position:0%
appeal uh through uh the Superior Court
 
06:39:30.590 --> 06:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
the regular superior court docket can
 
06:39:32.510 --> 06:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
take a long time and you know somebody
 
06:39:35.690 --> 06:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
who who spent I spent 18 years as a
 
06:39:37.628 --> 06:39:37.638 align:start position:0%
superior court judge I did a lot of of
 
06:39:42.048 --> 06:39:42.058 align:start position:0%
these land use cases and um it you know
 
06:39:44.990 --> 06:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's those even though the the current
 
06:39:47.868 --> 06:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
law says the cases are supposed to be
 
06:39:50.628 --> 06:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
given priority on the docket there are a
 
06:39:52.548 --> 06:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
lot of statutes that say you know the
 
06:39:54.830 --> 06:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
courts shall give priority on the docket
 
06:39:57.708 --> 06:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
and obviously under the Constitution the
 
06:39:59.570 --> 06:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
Superior Court handles criminal cases
 
06:40:02.390 --> 06:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
those have to get first priorities so
 
06:40:05.570 --> 06:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
the the reality is that in the Superior
 
06:40:08.810 --> 06:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
Court in the regular docket uh land use
 
06:40:11.570 --> 06:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
cases can take a while they uh and I
 
06:40:14.150 --> 06:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
think that's the idea of this is to try
 
06:40:15.708 --> 06:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
to um
 
06:40:19.570 --> 06:40:19.580 align:start position:0%
to speed things up so to speak
 
06:40:23.288 --> 06:40:23.298 align:start position:0%
and you'll note that the law
 
06:40:28.250 --> 06:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
specifically provides that the time
 
06:40:30.170 --> 06:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
limits it sets time limits it says that
 
06:40:33.288 --> 06:40:33.298 align:start position:0%
the structuring conference in um in
 
06:40:35.750 --> 06:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
these kinds of cases is to occur within
 
06:40:37.868 --> 06:40:37.878 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
06:40:41.030 --> 06:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
the hearing has to occur within 60 days
 
06:40:43.430 --> 06:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
of the time that the record is provided
 
06:40:45.170 --> 06:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
and just so you understand what that
 
06:40:48.048 --> 06:40:48.058 align:start position:0%
well typically what happens is let's say
 
06:40:50.330 --> 06:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
a planning board or a zoning board case
 
06:40:53.048 --> 06:40:53.058 align:start position:0%
in the before municipality
 
06:40:57.470 --> 06:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
they they will develop a record of their
 
06:40:59.208 --> 06:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
proceedings what you know what kind of
 
06:41:02.390 --> 06:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
hearings were were held who said what
 
06:41:04.610 --> 06:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
what are the plans that were submitted
 
06:41:07.430 --> 06:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing that constitutes the
 
06:41:10.250 --> 06:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
record uh sometimes that can involve
 
06:41:13.368 --> 06:41:13.378 align:start position:0%
creating uh getting a transcript of what
 
06:41:15.230 --> 06:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
happened of testimony that was presented
 
06:41:17.628 --> 06:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
at hearings not always but sometimes and
 
06:41:20.390 --> 06:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
if that has to be if the transcript has
 
06:41:22.510 --> 06:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
to be prepared that that takes some time
 
06:41:26.330 --> 06:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
So eventually there will be a record of
 
06:41:28.970 --> 06:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
what happened in the before the zoning
 
06:41:31.310 --> 06:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
or planning board and that will be pres
 
06:41:33.048 --> 06:41:33.058 align:start position:0%
that will be turned over to the Superior
 
06:41:33.058 --> 06:41:34.430 align:start position:0%
that will be turned over to the Superior
Court

06:41:34.430 --> 06:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
Court
 
06:41:38.510 --> 06:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
um the uh the this this proposed statute
 
06:41:40.610 --> 06:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
says that the hearing has to be held
 
06:41:43.610 --> 06:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of the time the record is
 
06:41:45.890 --> 06:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
turned over to the superior court and
 
06:41:48.230 --> 06:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
then a decision by the court has to be
 
06:41:51.948 --> 06:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
made within 60 days of the time it holds
 
06:41:54.590 --> 06:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
um a hearing on the matter uh now there
 
06:41:56.570 --> 06:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
is a there is a good cause exception as
 
06:41:59.090 --> 06:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
there is in many statutes if the if the
 
06:42:02.330 --> 06:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh if they're uh if there's a specific
 
06:42:04.730 --> 06:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
reason why things can't be resolved in
 
06:42:08.208 --> 06:42:08.218 align:start position:0%
60 days the court can grant an extension
 
06:42:10.970 --> 06:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
for good cause shown but if it's if if
 
06:42:12.830 --> 06:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
the court does it for that reason it has
 
06:42:14.208 --> 06:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
to articulate
 
06:42:15.708 --> 06:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
it can't just be like you know good
 
06:42:17.690 --> 06:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
cause challenge extension the court has
 
06:42:20.510 --> 06:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
to articulate what exactly is the good
 
06:42:24.830 --> 06:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
cause that justifies the extension
 
06:42:26.868 --> 06:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
um I would note
 
06:42:29.750 --> 06:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
um that um
 
06:42:35.830 --> 06:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
this this proposal is modeled on uh
 
06:42:38.930 --> 06:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
another Superior Courts uh sort of
 
06:42:40.910 --> 06:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
special docket the business court docket
 
06:42:44.090 --> 06:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
that this legislature passed God it's
 
06:42:46.010 --> 06:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
it's over 10 years ago I mean it's it's
 
06:42:48.770 --> 06:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
probably more like 15 years ago
 
06:42:51.048 --> 06:42:51.058 align:start position:0%
um where where business cases were
 
06:42:53.510 --> 06:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
Consolidated before
 
06:42:57.230 --> 06:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
um a a uh a single Superior Court Judge
 
06:42:59.930 --> 06:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
who was again in the same sort of
 
06:43:02.030 --> 06:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
fashion that this proposes was initially
 
06:43:05.690 --> 06:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
appointed by uh the governor
 
06:43:07.670 --> 06:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
in the usual fact in the usual fashion
 
06:43:11.150 --> 06:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
that appointment was made by uh Governor
 
06:43:13.670 --> 06:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
Lynch when uh the first business court
 
06:43:13.680 --> 06:43:14.868 align:start position:0%
Lynch when uh the first business court
judge

06:43:14.868 --> 06:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
judge
 
06:43:16.430 --> 06:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
um some of you may know him rich rich
 
06:43:19.128 --> 06:43:19.138 align:start position:0%
McNamara was a very prominent lawyer and
 
06:43:21.110 --> 06:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was appointed as the first
 
06:43:24.110 --> 06:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
business court judge and served until he
 
06:43:27.650 --> 06:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
until he until he reached age 70 and uh
 
06:43:30.890 --> 06:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
retired and he was I believe you know I
 
06:43:33.590 --> 06:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
think he was I Know Rich very well he's
 
06:43:36.770 --> 06:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
an it was an excellent judge shouldn't
 
06:43:39.170 --> 06:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
have had to retire but he did uh but he
 
06:43:41.810 --> 06:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
did an excellent job uh as as the
 
06:43:44.270 --> 06:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
business court judge and I think uh that
 
06:43:46.788 --> 06:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
I think if you asked
 
06:43:49.010 --> 06:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
um you know the overwhelming majority of
 
06:43:50.810 --> 06:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
lawyers in the state was the business
 
06:43:53.930 --> 06:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
Court a success they would say it was he
 
06:43:56.330 --> 06:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
was uh he was you know had a very great
 
06:43:58.610 --> 06:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
interest in that area really sort of
 
06:44:00.830 --> 06:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
intellectual kind of guy did just an
 
06:44:03.590 --> 06:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
excellent job and so
 
06:44:05.390 --> 06:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
um I have no reason to believe that we
 
06:44:07.128 --> 06:44:07.138 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the same kind of thing
 
06:44:07.138 --> 06:44:08.930 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the same kind of thing
happen

06:44:08.930 --> 06:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
happen
 
06:44:11.990 --> 06:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
with the with the land you stock it I
 
06:44:14.390 --> 06:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
should note that the governor is a
 
06:44:18.470 --> 06:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
strong supporter of this uh of this bill
 
06:44:20.390 --> 06:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
um thinks it's uh you know it's a it's a
 
06:44:22.850 --> 06:44:22.860 align:start position:0%
very worthwhile thing to do
 
06:44:24.590 --> 06:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and so I hope you'll I hope you'll
 
06:44:26.090 --> 06:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
support it and I'm happy to answer any
 
06:44:29.150 --> 06:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
questions that anybody may have
 
06:44:31.788 --> 06:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
representative kuta
 
06:44:34.970 --> 06:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
so would this bill replace the hab or
 
06:44:36.948 --> 06:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
would the hab still be in place no
 
06:44:39.770 --> 06:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
that's a very good excellent question
 
06:44:43.730 --> 06:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
um it would not replace the hab and
 
06:44:46.190 --> 06:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
um at least not now
 
06:44:49.368 --> 06:44:49.378 align:start position:0%
um I I at least and and my inclination
 
06:44:51.770 --> 06:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
would be I think this will be a really
 
06:44:55.490 --> 06:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
good addition to the Superior Court
 
06:44:59.448 --> 06:44:59.458 align:start position:0%
um and it and it may be that five years
 
06:45:02.390 --> 06:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
from now or ten years from now if the
 
06:45:05.090 --> 06:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
you know this was the uh uh land use
 
06:45:06.708 --> 06:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
Docket in the superior court is up and
 
06:45:08.930 --> 06:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
running and it's running just you know
 
06:45:10.970 --> 06:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
swimmingly like we like I expected it
 
06:45:14.090 --> 06:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
would be it might be at that point that
 
06:45:15.470 --> 06:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature would say well wait a
 
06:45:18.170 --> 06:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
minute you know for housing appeals we
 
06:45:19.970 --> 06:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
have sort of two Alternatives you can go
 
06:45:22.490 --> 06:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
to the land you stock it in the superior
 
06:45:24.770 --> 06:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
court or you can go to the hab why do we
 
06:45:27.948 --> 06:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
really need to have two alternative uh
 
06:45:30.708 --> 06:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
appeal Vehicles let's get rid of the hab
 
06:45:32.208 --> 06:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
because the superior court docket is
 
06:45:33.410 --> 06:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
working so well
 
06:45:35.510 --> 06:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
I would and that may make perfect sense
 
06:45:37.310 --> 06:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
to do that the only thing I would a
 
06:45:39.230 --> 06:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
caveat I would say on that just so you
 
06:45:41.930 --> 06:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
understand we do have and we have had
 
06:45:41.940 --> 06:45:43.250 align:start position:0%
understand we do have and we have had
for

06:45:43.250 --> 06:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:45:45.170 --> 06:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
God I think it's got to be close to 50
 
06:45:50.110 --> 06:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
years we have had alternative appeal
 
06:45:53.448 --> 06:45:53.458 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in in a similar type of case
 
06:45:55.690 --> 06:45:55.700 align:start position:0%
and what I'm talking about is
 
06:45:59.448 --> 06:45:59.458 align:start position:0%
the board of tax and land appeals that
 
06:46:02.390 --> 06:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
board which has been in existence for as
 
06:46:05.150 --> 06:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
I say about 50 years at least maybe more
 
06:46:09.288 --> 06:46:09.298 align:start position:0%
that handles appeals from property tax
 
06:46:11.270 --> 06:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
assessments that you know at the local
 
06:46:14.090 --> 06:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
level and also from eminent domain if
 
06:46:15.288 --> 06:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
there's been an eminent if there's an
 
06:46:17.510 --> 06:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
eminent domain taking
 
06:46:19.430 --> 06:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
um you haven't you as a person who is
 
06:46:20.930 --> 06:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
the subject of that you don't like your
 
06:46:22.610 --> 06:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
tax assessment or you think that you
 
06:46:24.650 --> 06:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
know your property's being improperly
 
06:46:28.208 --> 06:46:28.218 align:start position:0%
taken by the state uh you can either
 
06:46:30.590 --> 06:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
appeal to the board of tax and land
 
06:46:33.350 --> 06:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
appeals or you can appear appeal to the
 
06:46:34.670 --> 06:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
Superior Court they both have
 
06:46:37.788 --> 06:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and in either case if you
 
06:46:39.410 --> 06:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
don't like the result you get from
 
06:46:40.788 --> 06:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
either the board or the Superior Court
 
06:46:42.890 --> 06:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
you can appeal to the Supreme Court so
 
06:46:45.590 --> 06:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
if this docket were passed we would have
 
06:46:48.288 --> 06:46:48.298 align:start position:0%
the same kind of situation you'd have
 
06:46:50.270 --> 06:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
that you could go to the if it was a
 
06:46:52.670 --> 06:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
residential development
 
06:46:54.410 --> 06:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
um the you know the person the party
 
06:46:56.510 --> 06:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
agreed from the decision of a local land
 
06:46:59.810 --> 06:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
use board could go either to the hab or
 
06:47:01.968 --> 06:47:01.978 align:start position:0%
to the Superior Court
 
06:47:06.170 --> 06:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
um uh and you know as an alternative and
 
06:47:07.910 --> 06:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
I guess I I would say you might you know
 
06:47:09.430 --> 06:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things you might say is well
 
06:47:12.110 --> 06:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
isn't that really on you know isn't it
 
06:47:14.030 --> 06:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
isn't the board of tax on land appeals
 
06:47:16.490 --> 06:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
situ mechanism
 
06:47:19.730 --> 06:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
um sort of duplicatives does it cost you
 
06:47:21.230 --> 06:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
know does it cost more money than it
 
06:47:23.150 --> 06:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
should why do we have these two Avenues
 
06:47:26.330 --> 06:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
of appeal and those are all very valid
 
06:47:27.770 --> 06:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
questions when I was on the Supreme
 
06:47:31.128 --> 06:47:31.138 align:start position:0%
Court we asked those questions a lot uh
 
06:47:33.708 --> 06:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
but the reality is we didn't really see
 
06:47:36.650 --> 06:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
that anybody was complaining about this
 
06:47:39.830 --> 06:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
being duplicative or that the btla
 
06:47:41.990 --> 06:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't doing its job in these kind of
 
06:47:44.390 --> 06:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
cases or that the superior you know
 
06:47:46.070 --> 06:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
which should be only the superior court
 
06:47:48.948 --> 06:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
or only the btla they seem to work
 
06:47:53.390 --> 06:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
together you know the parties there were
 
06:47:57.890 --> 06:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
not there were not fights as far as the
 
06:48:00.530 --> 06:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court could see uh between
 
06:48:02.208 --> 06:48:02.218 align:start position:0%
litigants over you know well we should
 
06:48:04.730 --> 06:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
go here pressures go there it just seem
 
06:48:08.208 --> 06:48:08.218 align:start position:0%
both both bodies seem to do their job
 
06:48:10.670 --> 06:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
and so I it might be that five years
 
06:48:12.890 --> 06:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
from now if we pass this bill that would
 
06:48:15.048 --> 06:48:15.058 align:start position:0%
be the same situation with the hab and
 
06:48:18.770 --> 06:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:20.510 --> 06:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:48:22.070 --> 06:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
so to make sure I'm understanding
 
06:48:25.010 --> 06:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
correctly where this isn't replacing
 
06:48:27.410 --> 06:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
have you could either use have or the
 
06:48:29.868 --> 06:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
superior land this new Superior land use
 
06:48:32.448 --> 06:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
court but how would it work with appeals
 
06:48:34.368 --> 06:48:34.378 align:start position:0%
if you had used Hab would you first
 
06:48:36.468 --> 06:48:36.478 align:start position:0%
appeal to this court or could you go
 
06:48:37.968 --> 06:48:37.978 align:start position:0%
directly to the Supreme Court how would
 
06:48:40.010 --> 06:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
that how would this change that yeah no
 
06:48:43.368 --> 06:48:43.378 align:start position:0%
you you from either the hab or this
 
06:48:45.288 --> 06:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
docket or this this you know the
 
06:48:47.208 --> 06:48:47.218 align:start position:0%
Superior Court land you stock it you
 
06:48:48.770 --> 06:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
could go directly to the Supreme Court
 
06:48:50.810 --> 06:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to go
 
06:48:53.030 --> 06:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
from the have to the superior court and
 
06:48:54.350 --> 06:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
then to the Supreme Court it would be a
 
06:48:57.170 --> 06:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
direct appeal from either have or the
 
06:48:59.090 --> 06:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
Superior Court directly to the Supreme
 
06:48:59.100 --> 06:49:00.650 align:start position:0%
Superior Court directly to the Supreme
Court

06:49:00.650 --> 06:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
Court
 
06:49:02.270 --> 06:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you
 
06:49:03.948 --> 06:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
adding off of the clerk's question it is
 
06:49:05.270 --> 06:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
the applicants
 
06:49:08.090 --> 06:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
um option to pursue the hab or the land
 
06:49:09.890 --> 06:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
use docket depending on it's their
 
06:49:12.170 --> 06:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
choice where that case goes exactly yes
 
06:49:15.350 --> 06:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
yes it would be their choice
 
06:49:17.030 --> 06:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp
 
06:49:19.368 --> 06:49:19.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair
 
06:49:22.310 --> 06:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh just
 
06:49:24.350 --> 06:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
how many of these land use dockets would
 
06:49:25.850 --> 06:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
there be
 
06:49:28.190 --> 06:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
well I think there'd be quite a I I
 
06:49:30.770 --> 06:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
can't give you a number man more than
 
06:49:34.788 --> 06:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
one oh yeah definitely more uh Mr head
 
06:49:35.930 --> 06:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
is here
 
06:49:37.730 --> 06:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
um he may be able to he may have those
 
06:49:41.570 --> 06:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
numbers I don't I I can say that you
 
06:49:43.010 --> 06:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
know when I was on the Superior Court
 
06:49:45.530 --> 06:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
there I mean in in 18 years on the
 
06:49:47.868 --> 06:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
superior court I did
 
06:49:50.270 --> 06:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
quite a number of land use appeals over
 
06:49:52.670 --> 06:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
that time in various counties where I
 
06:49:54.530 --> 06:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
sat I I can't put a number on it but it
 
06:49:56.810 --> 06:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
was you know it was a pretty substantial
 
06:49:59.510 --> 06:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
number of of cases
 
06:50:01.548 --> 06:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
follow-up so there would be more than
 
06:50:05.150 --> 06:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:08.810 --> 06:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
since there's only one right
 
06:50:11.390 --> 06:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
um well
 
06:50:13.850 --> 06:50:13.860 align:start position:0%
you know I I
 
06:50:16.850 --> 06:50:16.860 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
06:50:20.030 --> 06:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
if the the plan here would be that all
 
06:50:22.250 --> 06:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
of the land use appeals would be would
 
06:50:24.830 --> 06:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
would be Consolidated the ones all the
 
06:50:26.150 --> 06:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
land use appeals that go to the Superior
 
06:50:28.968 --> 06:50:28.978 align:start position:0%
Court would be Consolidated in the land
 
06:50:30.708 --> 06:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
use docket
 
06:50:30.718 --> 06:50:31.490 align:start position:0%
use docket
um

06:50:31.490 --> 06:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:35.208 --> 06:50:35.218 align:start position:0%
so one judge would be doing all of those
 
06:50:36.770 --> 06:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
now whether
 
06:50:39.350 --> 06:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
there would be a need for more than one
 
06:50:42.650 --> 06:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
judge I'm I'm frankly not sure and again
 
06:50:44.868 --> 06:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
Mr head may have more information I
 
06:50:48.048 --> 06:50:48.058 align:start position:0%
would I would just point point this out
 
06:50:50.208 --> 06:50:50.218 align:start position:0%
in the in the business you know to the
 
06:50:51.288 --> 06:50:51.298 align:start position:0%
extent when I was using the business
 
06:50:54.708 --> 06:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
Court analogy before uh judge McNamara
 
06:50:58.010 --> 06:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
spent a significant portion of his time
 
06:51:00.948 --> 06:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
doing business cases but not all of them
 
06:51:03.590 --> 06:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
he did try some criminal cases and do
 
06:51:06.288 --> 06:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
some other some other things so you know
 
06:51:08.150 --> 06:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
I think it I think it probably would
 
06:51:11.208 --> 06:51:11.218 align:start position:0%
would be uh sort of depend on the ebb
 
06:51:12.350 --> 06:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
and flow of work there might be
 
06:51:14.090 --> 06:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes when the business Court Judge
 
06:51:16.310 --> 06:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
would have a slack and would be be able
 
06:51:17.930 --> 06:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
to do some other some other Superior
 
06:51:20.150 --> 06:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
Court work but I suspect that most of
 
06:51:23.150 --> 06:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
the time he or she would be doing the
 
06:51:25.250 --> 06:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
land use cases and in fact it could even
 
06:51:26.628 --> 06:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
be the case that there would you know
 
06:51:27.948 --> 06:51:27.958 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court would have to impose
 
06:51:30.468 --> 06:51:30.478 align:start position:0%
would have to appoint another judge to
 
06:51:33.530 --> 06:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
that docket uh depending on how many
 
06:51:35.030 --> 06:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
cases there were well thank you very
 
06:51:35.040 --> 06:51:37.070 align:start position:0%
cases there were well thank you very
much

06:51:37.070 --> 06:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
much
 
06:51:39.110 --> 06:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative Manos
 
06:51:41.868 --> 06:51:41.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair I wanted to know
 
06:51:45.410 --> 06:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
would would this use existing judicial
 
06:51:45.420 --> 06:51:46.810 align:start position:0%
would would this use existing judicial
resources

06:51:46.810 --> 06:51:46.820 align:start position:0%
resources
 
06:51:50.030 --> 06:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
now the actually the bill provides that
 
06:51:51.948 --> 06:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
06:51:55.310 --> 06:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
um will appoint the first
 
06:51:58.670 --> 06:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
um the the first uh
 
06:52:00.468 --> 06:52:00.478 align:start position:0%
um business core I have in business
 
06:52:03.890 --> 06:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
Court the first land you stock it judge
 
06:52:07.070 --> 06:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
um under the bill so there would be at
 
06:52:10.330 --> 06:52:10.340 align:start position:0%
least one new judge that would be
 
06:52:13.368 --> 06:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
appointed to be the land you stock it
 
06:52:16.368 --> 06:52:16.378 align:start position:0%
judge and then after that from the
 
06:52:19.610 --> 06:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
existing Superior Court the the Chief
 
06:52:20.990 --> 06:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Superior Court could
 
06:52:22.670 --> 06:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
appoint additional judges if if
 
06:52:24.830 --> 06:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
necessary but there would be at least
 
06:52:29.330 --> 06:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
one new judge uh uh for the business the
 
06:52:29.340 --> 06:52:32.150 align:start position:0%
one new judge uh uh for the business the
docket

06:52:32.150 --> 06:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:35.330 --> 06:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
representative Manos thank you I also
 
06:52:37.868 --> 06:52:37.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to know how this would affect
 
06:52:41.208 --> 06:52:41.218 align:start position:0%
other cases in the superior court so for
 
06:52:43.670 --> 06:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
example if there's a civil case that's
 
06:52:47.090 --> 06:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
been pending for a long time would would
 
06:52:50.868 --> 06:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
this docket take precedence over other
 
06:52:53.090 --> 06:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
existing cases
 
06:52:55.730 --> 06:52:55.740 align:start position:0%
no I think in other words I think that's
 
06:52:57.230 --> 06:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
06:53:01.610 --> 06:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
of having sort of a new judge
 
06:53:03.708 --> 06:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
um appointed
 
06:53:05.750 --> 06:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
um would be to so that that you know
 
06:53:09.170 --> 06:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
that judge would would then be doing the
 
06:53:09.180 --> 06:53:10.430 align:start position:0%
that judge would would then be doing the
uh

06:53:10.430 --> 06:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:53:14.270 --> 06:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
would be doing the land use uh stuff
 
06:53:16.010 --> 06:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
um other
 
06:53:18.410 --> 06:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
the other judges would continue to be to
 
06:53:21.410 --> 06:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
be doing their regular work now I guess
 
06:53:24.708 --> 06:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
if the you know if the if the land use
 
06:53:27.830 --> 06:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
docket became so new it became so full
 
06:53:29.628 --> 06:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
that there needed to be more judges
 
06:53:29.638 --> 06:53:31.190 align:start position:0%
that there needed to be more judges
assigned

06:53:31.190 --> 06:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
assigned
 
06:53:33.708 --> 06:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
um it would be up to the Chief Justice
 
06:53:35.090 --> 06:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
of the Superior Court to make that
 
06:53:36.890 --> 06:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
decision but I I assume that what would
 
06:53:39.170 --> 06:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
happen if you know if if something like
 
06:53:40.730 --> 06:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
that happened and there wasn't enough
 
06:53:43.128 --> 06:53:43.138 align:start position:0%
there just weren't enough judges to do
 
06:53:45.650 --> 06:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
all the work they would be back
 
06:53:47.570 --> 06:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
they were the the judicial branch would
 
06:53:50.270 --> 06:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
be back here asking for more judges
 
06:53:52.850 --> 06:53:52.860 align:start position:0%
um as for as for example they are as I
 
06:53:54.350 --> 06:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
understand their their budget request
 
06:53:56.330 --> 06:53:56.340 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not in finance anymore but as I
 
06:53:58.070 --> 06:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
understand their budget request they're
 
06:53:59.448 --> 06:53:59.458 align:start position:0%
asking for a significant number of
 
06:54:01.968 --> 06:54:01.978 align:start position:0%
judges for this for the Circuit Court
 
06:54:04.128 --> 06:54:04.138 align:start position:0%
um which I think they need
 
06:54:06.350 --> 06:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
um so I mean that that's I think that
 
06:54:09.350 --> 06:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
would be the way that would be handled
 
06:54:11.270 --> 06:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up representative Manos
 
06:54:13.368 --> 06:54:13.378 align:start position:0%
thank you so this
 
06:54:15.948 --> 06:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
in your view this could potentially free
 
06:54:18.170 --> 06:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
up or
 
06:54:18.180 --> 06:54:18.830 align:start position:0%
up or
um

06:54:18.830 --> 06:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:23.208 --> 06:54:23.218 align:start position:0%
speed up other civil cases yeah no I
 
06:54:24.530 --> 06:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
think that's I think that that's
 
06:54:26.448 --> 06:54:26.458 align:start position:0%
probably right because the to the extent
 
06:54:28.010 --> 06:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
06:54:30.590 --> 06:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
06:54:34.490 --> 06:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
land use cases Consolidated before one
 
06:54:36.048 --> 06:54:36.058 align:start position:0%
judge that means that you know it's
 
06:54:38.208 --> 06:54:38.218 align:start position:0%
gonna they're gonna be taken off the
 
06:54:41.810 --> 06:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
docket of of the other judges which
 
06:54:44.510 --> 06:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
would give them more time to do to do
 
06:54:47.030 --> 06:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:48.948 --> 06:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
06:54:51.410 --> 06:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:54:54.350 --> 06:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn I'm going to save a
 
06:54:56.810 --> 06:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
number of questions for my good friend
 
06:55:00.590 --> 06:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
from the judicial branch but um I've
 
06:55:03.230 --> 06:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
read this bill a couple of times and I
 
06:55:07.310 --> 06:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
don't see anywhere in this that you have
 
06:55:09.948 --> 06:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
specified that there would be an
 
06:55:13.750 --> 06:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
additional position added
 
06:55:19.490 --> 06:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
to uh a superior court and all I see is
 
06:55:23.150 --> 06:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
that the governor would name
 
06:55:26.030 --> 06:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
of presiding judge of the land use court
 
06:55:28.730 --> 06:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
but I see no reason why or no indication
 
06:55:30.468 --> 06:55:30.478 align:start position:0%
that he's not going to take that person
 
06:55:37.128 --> 06:55:37.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:39.708 --> 06:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
well he would have to the government
 
06:55:41.628 --> 06:55:41.638 align:start position:0%
account May appoint the first presiding
 
06:55:44.868 --> 06:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
Justice of the land you so I'm sorry so
 
06:55:46.548 --> 06:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
you're you're thinking that he might be
 
06:55:48.468 --> 06:55:48.478 align:start position:0%
that the governor might say out I'm
 
06:55:51.288 --> 06:55:51.298 align:start position:0%
taking from among the
 
06:55:54.110 --> 06:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
yes that's what I'm thinking and I say
 
06:55:58.250 --> 06:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
that based on past experience of what
 
06:56:01.030 --> 06:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
has happened when over the years
 
06:56:03.350 --> 06:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
additional definitions or
 
06:56:05.868 --> 06:56:05.878 align:start position:0%
responsibilities have come in and that
 
06:56:09.048 --> 06:56:09.058 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily get reflected in an
 
06:56:12.410 --> 06:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of Judges or
 
06:56:14.750 --> 06:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
justices I always like to use judge for
 
06:56:17.150 --> 06:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
everybody except the Supremes but I know
 
06:56:19.670 --> 06:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not supposed to do that well you
 
06:56:22.250 --> 06:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
know I have to I have to say I
 
06:56:25.610 --> 06:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
um I had not I I guess I would say I
 
06:56:27.350 --> 06:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
would agree with you I suppose if you
 
06:56:29.570 --> 06:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
read this language that could happen I
 
06:56:31.430 --> 06:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
had not anticipated that it would happen
 
06:56:33.170 --> 06:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
and I don't think
 
06:56:35.990 --> 06:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
but I miss Mr head will correct me if
 
06:56:37.250 --> 06:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong I don't
 
06:56:39.830 --> 06:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
my unders my impression was that this
 
06:56:41.628 --> 06:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
that the judicial branch was also
 
06:56:43.548 --> 06:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
thinking there would be a new judge
 
06:56:43.558 --> 06:56:45.410 align:start position:0%
thinking there would be a new judge
appointed

06:56:45.410 --> 06:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
06:56:47.090 --> 06:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
um for
 
06:56:49.968 --> 06:56:49.978 align:start position:0%
um and it man you know and and I assume
 
06:56:51.830 --> 06:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
their budget requests
 
06:56:54.230 --> 06:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
um would would contemplate that uh with
 
06:56:56.990 --> 06:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
all due respect the government oh I'm
 
06:56:58.610 --> 06:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
sorry may I follow up
 
06:57:01.368 --> 06:57:01.378 align:start position:0%
may I thank you only this one with all
 
06:57:02.690 --> 06:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
due respect
 
06:57:05.390 --> 06:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
um my experience has been that the
 
06:57:08.270 --> 06:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
judicial branch frequently asks for
 
06:57:11.750 --> 06:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
additional judges specific number and
 
06:57:13.850 --> 06:57:13.860 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't get any and
 
06:57:16.610 --> 06:57:16.620 align:start position:0%
sometimes they get some I'm not aware of
 
06:57:19.968 --> 06:57:19.978 align:start position:0%
any time they received anything more
 
06:57:24.110 --> 06:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
than they had requested and um that's
 
06:57:25.150 --> 06:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
06:57:30.350 --> 06:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
and so I would think that you know if
 
06:57:33.650 --> 06:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
wishes were horses we would all ride I
 
06:57:35.030 --> 06:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
think that there has to be something
 
06:57:39.170 --> 06:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
staying very specifically uh that the
 
06:57:41.090 --> 06:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
expectation is that there would be an
 
06:57:44.330 --> 06:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
additional judge and I I hope you agree
 
06:57:46.968 --> 06:57:46.978 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:49.788 --> 06:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
well as I say I had not I had just sort
 
06:57:52.368 --> 06:57:52.378 align:start position:0%
of assumed that that's what would be
 
06:57:54.530 --> 06:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
that that's what was intended and that
 
06:57:56.570 --> 06:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch was going to be
 
06:57:58.490 --> 06:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
requesting an additional Superior Court
 
06:58:01.368 --> 06:58:01.378 align:start position:0%
judge for that purpose uh you didn't
 
06:58:03.110 --> 06:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
serve with a finance long enough that's
 
06:58:05.628 --> 06:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
your problem but I and that may be right
 
06:58:08.390 --> 06:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
but uh at any rate I I mean if that
 
06:58:10.730 --> 06:58:10.740 align:start position:0%
needed to be put in there specifically I
 
06:58:12.350 --> 06:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
would certainly be willing to file an
 
06:58:14.150 --> 06:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to do that
 
06:58:16.490 --> 06:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
yes and if I might direct you to the
 
06:58:18.590 --> 06:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it does say that there will
 
06:58:21.310 --> 06:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
be an additional Justice appointed
 
06:58:24.350 --> 06:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
and representative Perez
 
06:58:26.030 --> 06:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you that's what I was going to say
 
06:58:28.430 --> 06:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
it specifically says that in the fiscal
 
06:58:30.410 --> 06:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
note thank you
 
06:58:32.208 --> 06:58:32.218 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
06:58:32.218 --> 06:58:33.708 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
Lynn

06:58:33.708 --> 06:58:33.718 align:start position:0%
Lynn
 
06:58:37.190 --> 06:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much
 
06:58:39.128 --> 06:58:39.138 align:start position:0%
um we now call
 
06:58:53.150 --> 06:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:53.160 --> 06:59:07.910 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:59:07.910 --> 06:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:07.920 --> 06:59:09.288 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:59:09.288 --> 06:59:09.298 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:59:11.868 --> 06:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn Vice chair Wallace and
 
06:59:14.090 --> 06:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee members for the
 
06:59:15.708 --> 06:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ben Ming I'm a state
 
06:59:18.048 --> 06:59:18.058 align:start position:0%
representative from Hollis I thank you
 
06:59:19.368 --> 06:59:19.378 align:start position:0%
for your time in listening to my support
 
06:59:22.730 --> 06:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
for HB 347 which seeks to establish the
 
06:59:25.368 --> 06:59:25.378 align:start position:0%
Superior Court land use docket
 
06:59:27.230 --> 06:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
I'm a lawyer and my practice over the
 
06:59:29.030 --> 06:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
last 10 plus years has touched on nearly
 
06:59:30.830 --> 06:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
all matters relating to real estate
 
06:59:32.628 --> 06:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
buying and selling residential and
 
06:59:34.730 --> 06:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
commercial landlord tenant and most
 
06:59:36.350 --> 06:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
relevant to this bill
 
06:59:39.350 --> 06:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
litigation and land use and zoning is my
 
06:59:40.788 --> 06:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
opinion that courts need efficient
 
06:59:43.670 --> 06:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
systems and HP 347 will push them in the
 
06:59:45.048 --> 06:59:45.058 align:start position:0%
right direction
 
06:59:46.670 --> 06:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the probate process
 
06:59:49.310 --> 06:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
gives a taste of this type of efficiency
 
06:59:51.048 --> 06:59:51.058 align:start position:0%
her rate is the legal process of
 
06:59:53.150 --> 06:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
determining among other things if a
 
06:59:55.310 --> 06:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
deceased person's will is valid
 
06:59:57.048 --> 06:59:57.058 align:start position:0%
probate files are e-filed and
 
06:59:58.788 --> 06:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
centralized to the state
 
07:00:00.770 --> 07:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
in contrast the probate process and
 
07:00:02.810 --> 07:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
other states go goes through individual
 
07:00:04.128 --> 07:00:04.138 align:start position:0%
County offices
 
07:00:05.628 --> 07:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
and operates with the use of paper
 
07:00:05.638 --> 07:00:07.250 align:start position:0%
and operates with the use of paper
documents

07:00:07.250 --> 07:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
documents
 
07:00:09.410 --> 07:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
which begs the question why should this
 
07:00:11.510 --> 07:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
level of efficiency be extended to the
 
07:00:12.708 --> 07:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
07:00:16.070 --> 07:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
the short answer is limited resources
 
07:00:17.690 --> 07:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
one of the many things young lawyers are
 
07:00:20.030 --> 07:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
told in law school and practices be
 
07:00:21.350 --> 07:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
cautious with what you tell clients you
 
07:00:21.360 --> 07:00:22.250 align:start position:0%
cautious with what you tell clients you
know

07:00:22.250 --> 07:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
know
 
07:00:24.230 --> 07:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
but don't let lack of experience be a
 
07:00:25.548 --> 07:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
deterrent for pursuing the knowledge
 
07:00:27.048 --> 07:00:27.058 align:start position:0%
required to help
 
07:00:29.030 --> 07:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
I highly highlight this to say that
 
07:00:31.850 --> 07:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
judges are largely owed the difference
 
07:00:33.708 --> 07:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
they receive from lawyers and the public
 
07:00:34.910 --> 07:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
in general
 
07:00:37.610 --> 07:00:37.620 align:start position:0%
however they are not superhumans the law
 
07:00:38.690 --> 07:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
is vast
 
07:00:40.190 --> 07:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
and few if any can have a masterful
 
07:00:42.530 --> 07:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
grasp of every single Nuance in practice
 
07:00:44.868 --> 07:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
with limited time
 
07:00:47.270 --> 07:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
the superior court is a trial court and
 
07:00:48.590 --> 07:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
having a strong grasp of law is
 
07:00:50.810 --> 07:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
important but equally important is the
 
07:00:52.190 --> 07:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
establishment of the facts of the case
 
07:00:52.200 --> 07:00:53.750 align:start position:0%
establishment of the facts of the case
again

07:00:53.750 --> 07:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
07:00:56.090 --> 07:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
time is limited to establish facts and
 
07:00:58.190 --> 07:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
review applicable law
 
07:01:00.830 --> 07:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
we can't create more time but what we
 
07:01:02.390 --> 07:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
can do is identify and establish the
 
07:01:04.010 --> 07:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
fact that land use and Zoning is highly
 
07:01:05.750 --> 07:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
consequential in New Hampshire
 
07:01:08.208 --> 07:01:08.218 align:start position:0%
out of 234 municipalities in New
 
07:01:11.390 --> 07:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only 17 have no zoning code
 
07:01:13.788 --> 07:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
zoning is opt-in in other words the RSA
 
07:01:15.650 --> 07:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
that gave gave life to zoning in New
 
07:01:15.660 --> 07:01:16.368 align:start position:0%
that gave gave life to zoning in New
Hampshire

07:01:16.368 --> 07:01:16.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
07:01:18.170 --> 07:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
requires formal steps to establish
 
07:01:20.868 --> 07:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
zoning in any municipality
 
07:01:23.990 --> 07:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
each Community must agree to it
 
07:01:26.750 --> 07:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
zoning codes shaped municipalities and
 
07:01:29.270 --> 07:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
the way each Community sees fit and the
 
07:01:30.170 --> 07:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire have
 
07:01:32.030 --> 07:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
historically and overwhelmingly said yes
 
07:01:34.670 --> 07:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
to zoning does local control
 
07:01:36.110 --> 07:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
because we have that type of local
 
07:01:36.120 --> 07:01:37.070 align:start position:0%
because we have that type of local
control

07:01:37.070 --> 07:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
control
 
07:01:39.110 --> 07:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
we also have over 200 unique zoning
 
07:01:41.868 --> 07:01:41.878 align:start position:0%
codes in the state many of them over 100
 
07:01:43.368 --> 07:01:43.378 align:start position:0%
pages long
 
07:01:45.770 --> 07:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
it isn't fair to the judge their staff
 
07:01:47.930 --> 07:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
or either partying in a litigated land
 
07:01:49.190 --> 07:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
use matter
 
07:01:51.048 --> 07:01:51.058 align:start position:0%
to bring a hyper local issue to a
 
07:01:53.270 --> 07:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
courtroom that may require a significant
 
07:01:55.190 --> 07:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
amount of additional time just to
 
07:01:57.350 --> 07:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
understand all the specifics that make a
 
07:02:00.230 --> 07:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
certain zoning code in question unique
 
07:02:01.910 --> 07:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
this is a step toward a more efficient
 
07:02:02.930 --> 07:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
court system
 
07:02:04.368 --> 07:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
and I request that you support the
 
07:02:07.610 --> 07:02:07.620 align:start position:0%
passage of house bill 347.
 
07:02:11.628 --> 07:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:13.128 --> 07:02:13.138 align:start position:0%
there any questions for representative
 
07:02:13.138 --> 07:02:15.170 align:start position:0%
there any questions for representative

07:02:17.810 --> 07:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
none we thank you I will actually add
 
07:02:19.788 --> 07:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
one comment
 
07:02:19.798 --> 07:02:24.530 align:start position:0%
one comment
um

07:02:24.530 --> 07:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:30.230 --> 07:02:30.240 align:start position:0%

um

07:02:32.270 --> 07:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:33.948 --> 07:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
it talks about the person's knowledge
 
07:02:35.330 --> 07:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
and experience in land use in Real
 
07:02:37.368 --> 07:02:37.378 align:start position:0%
Property law and I think rightly land
 
07:02:40.128 --> 07:02:40.138 align:start position:0%
use is highlighted
 
07:02:42.170 --> 07:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
um and typically I would put land use
 
07:02:43.968 --> 07:02:43.978 align:start position:0%
Under the Umbrella of real property law
 
07:02:46.968 --> 07:02:46.978 align:start position:0%
and when I hear real property law I
 
07:02:46.978 --> 07:02:47.930 align:start position:0%
and when I hear real property law I
think

07:02:47.930 --> 07:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
think
 
07:02:50.810 --> 07:02:50.820 align:start position:0%
a practitioner which means
 
07:02:52.430 --> 07:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
if you take out land use it's
 
07:02:54.830 --> 07:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
transactional it's contracts
 
07:02:54.840 --> 07:02:56.030 align:start position:0%
transactional it's contracts
um

07:02:56.030 --> 07:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:58.250 --> 07:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
and I believe representative Lynn chair
 
07:03:01.070 --> 07:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
Lynn said that uh a knowledge of
 
07:03:04.850 --> 07:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
property law in general is what is the
 
07:03:06.708 --> 07:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
type of Judge that would be appropriate
 
07:03:08.690 --> 07:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
for this position so I just want to
 
07:03:10.490 --> 07:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
highlight if there's a way of saying
 
07:03:13.548 --> 07:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
that land use is is truly the um should
 
07:03:16.250 --> 07:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
should be the deciding factor
 
07:03:19.610 --> 07:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:22.010 --> 07:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
I would also suggest with
 
07:03:24.530 --> 07:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
chairman Lin's uh blessing that the
 
07:03:27.110 --> 07:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice also follow
 
07:03:27.120 --> 07:03:28.250 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice also follow
um

07:03:28.250 --> 07:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:03:30.530 --> 07:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
in the appointment of additional judges
 
07:03:31.968 --> 07:03:31.978 align:start position:0%
that they should
 
07:03:33.468 --> 07:03:33.478 align:start position:0%
they should review
 
07:03:37.548 --> 07:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:41.868 --> 07:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:44.150 --> 07:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
no further questions uh we now call
 
07:03:51.830 --> 07:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:53.448 --> 07:03:53.458 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
07:03:54.590 --> 07:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Richard head
 
07:03:56.570 --> 07:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
I'm the government Affairs coordinator
 
07:03:59.570 --> 07:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch I think I will
 
07:04:01.910 --> 07:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
make representative Smith happy in that
 
07:04:04.250 --> 07:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
I will affirmatively say we not only
 
07:04:06.468 --> 07:04:06.478 align:start position:0%
support this bill we ask that it be
 
07:04:08.770 --> 07:04:08.780 align:start position:0%
voted out of committee ought to pass
 
07:04:13.968 --> 07:04:13.978 align:start position:0%
we did include it within the budget for
 
07:04:19.788 --> 07:04:19.798 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch and it is a
 
07:04:21.890 --> 07:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
it is an important position it's an
 
07:04:25.128 --> 07:04:25.138 align:start position:0%
important issue that the state faces uh
 
07:04:27.468 --> 07:04:27.478 align:start position:0%
and and would provide a significant
 
07:04:29.750 --> 07:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
benefit I think to the judicial branch
 
07:04:32.510 --> 07:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
and to the state I will just know a
 
07:04:34.968 --> 07:04:34.978 align:start position:0%
couple things in terms of
 
07:04:37.910 --> 07:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
um representative Lynn's testimony he
 
07:04:39.468 --> 07:04:39.478 align:start position:0%
kept talking about the business Court in
 
07:04:41.628 --> 07:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
the past tense it is still and continues
 
07:04:44.090 --> 07:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
to be incredibly successful
 
07:04:46.930 --> 07:04:46.940 align:start position:0%
um under judge Anderson uh and and
 
07:04:49.910 --> 07:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
continues with that same success
 
07:04:49.920 --> 07:04:50.868 align:start position:0%
continues with that same success
um

07:04:50.868 --> 07:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:04:54.048 --> 07:04:54.058 align:start position:0%
when asked the judges in our Superior
 
07:04:56.990 --> 07:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
Court described these types of cases as
 
07:05:00.530 --> 07:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
complex it is an area of the law that is
 
07:05:03.468 --> 07:05:03.478 align:start position:0%
detailed and involves attorneys who are
 
07:05:05.570 --> 07:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
experts and and have a great deal of
 
07:05:09.110 --> 07:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge it involves experts we have uh
 
07:05:12.288 --> 07:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
all of these cases involve a very
 
07:05:16.490 --> 07:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
technical area of Law and fact and we
 
07:05:18.650 --> 07:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
get Engineers we have Wetland scientists
 
07:05:22.128 --> 07:05:22.138 align:start position:0%
we have hydrogeologists we have
 
07:05:25.090 --> 07:05:25.100 align:start position:0%
um just a why surveyors
 
07:05:27.948 --> 07:05:27.958 align:start position:0%
a wide range of experts who tend to be
 
07:05:30.350 --> 07:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
involved in these types of cases and
 
07:05:33.530 --> 07:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
they require a great deal of time to get
 
07:05:35.570 --> 07:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
up to speed and one of the things the
 
07:05:38.750 --> 07:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
judges commented on was if we only see
 
07:05:41.390 --> 07:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
these as part of our regular docket and
 
07:05:43.628 --> 07:05:43.638 align:start position:0%
mixed in and occasionally
 
07:05:47.330 --> 07:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
it becomes it is just a a greater lift
 
07:05:50.048 --> 07:05:50.058 align:start position:0%
to get up to speed again and to get
 
07:05:52.250 --> 07:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
re-familiarize yourself not only with
 
07:05:54.410 --> 07:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
the case itself but with the technical
 
07:05:57.110 --> 07:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
aspects of it and the law which is also
 
07:05:59.510 --> 07:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
as you heard very complicated long and
 
07:06:02.510 --> 07:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
and detailed so to be able to
 
07:06:05.390 --> 07:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
consolidate these types of cases the
 
07:06:07.610 --> 07:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
complexity of these cases into a single
 
07:06:10.610 --> 07:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
docket would just have inherent benefits
 
07:06:13.490 --> 07:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
associated with with doing so
 
07:06:15.948 --> 07:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
um you have the very aggressive time
 
07:06:18.288 --> 07:06:18.298 align:start position:0%
frames that are laid out in the statute
 
07:06:20.690 --> 07:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
we agree that those are appropriate and
 
07:06:23.990 --> 07:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
and those time frames can be met under
 
07:06:27.110 --> 07:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
the circumstances of having a specific
 
07:06:30.230 --> 07:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
Judge assigned to the docket
 
07:06:30.240 --> 07:06:31.310 align:start position:0%
Judge assigned to the docket
um

07:06:31.310 --> 07:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:33.890 --> 07:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
one of the things and I do think in
 
07:06:35.690 --> 07:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
response to representative Smith's
 
07:06:37.490 --> 07:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
question there actually does need to be
 
07:06:39.170 --> 07:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
07:06:40.990 --> 07:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
um RSA
 
07:06:44.270 --> 07:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps not only just to clarify that
 
07:06:46.788 --> 07:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
the the initial appointment would be a
 
07:06:50.270 --> 07:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
new judge as described in the in the
 
07:06:53.868 --> 07:06:53.878 align:start position:0%
bill but RSA 491 colon 1 currently has a
 
07:06:55.548 --> 07:06:55.558 align:start position:0%
limit on the number of Superior Court
 
07:06:58.850 --> 07:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
judges is currently 22 and that would
 
07:07:02.690 --> 07:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
need to be increased to 23. so 490 RSA
 
07:07:06.590 --> 07:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
491 colon 1 would need Amendment I'm
 
07:07:10.010 --> 07:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
happy to to provide uh the chair with a
 
07:07:12.230 --> 07:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
with a proposed language for that
 
07:07:14.990 --> 07:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment but I do think representative
 
07:07:17.990 --> 07:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
Smith's point is well taken and an
 
07:07:19.610 --> 07:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
additional Amendment would be necessary
 
07:07:22.430 --> 07:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
in order for that additional judge to be
 
07:07:24.830 --> 07:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
able to come into the system
 
07:07:24.840 --> 07:07:25.430 align:start position:0%
able to come into the system
um

07:07:25.430 --> 07:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:07:28.850 --> 07:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
the you know in in closing what I would
 
07:07:31.430 --> 07:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
say is that these files are very large
 
07:07:32.868 --> 07:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
they're very dense they're very
 
07:07:35.270 --> 07:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
complicated they're very technical and
 
07:07:37.010 --> 07:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
to be able to have a judge who is
 
07:07:39.948 --> 07:07:39.958 align:start position:0%
dedicated to this area
 
07:07:42.890 --> 07:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
um and to be constantly involved in this
 
07:07:45.890 --> 07:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
area is a substantial benefit to the
 
07:07:48.170 --> 07:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
parties to the state and to the into the
 
07:07:53.030 --> 07:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and to our ability to uh
 
07:07:55.128 --> 07:07:55.138 align:start position:0%
resolve these cases quickly I mean
 
07:07:57.230 --> 07:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
whether it be a housing issue or whether
 
07:08:00.110 --> 07:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
it be a commercial issue time and delay
 
07:08:02.208 --> 07:08:02.218 align:start position:0%
is money and it costs money and it
 
07:08:05.090 --> 07:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
causes uh additional issues the goal is
 
07:08:07.910 --> 07:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
to get these resolved quickly in
 
07:08:10.190 --> 07:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
response to one of the questions one of
 
07:08:12.490 --> 07:08:12.500 align:start position:0%
the things we've observed there there
 
07:08:15.650 --> 07:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
range in terms of the number of cases
 
07:08:18.288 --> 07:08:18.298 align:start position:0%
it's it's not our highest docket they
 
07:08:22.250 --> 07:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
tend to be in the 60s to 100 uh it
 
07:08:24.468 --> 07:08:24.478 align:start position:0%
depends on sort of what is happening in
 
07:08:26.570 --> 07:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
the market and what is happening in in
 
07:08:30.350 --> 07:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
terms of development we have not seen
 
07:08:32.690 --> 07:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
any changes in our numbers that we would
 
07:08:35.090 --> 07:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
associate with the creation of the
 
07:08:39.410 --> 07:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
housing uh appellate to have
 
07:08:42.230 --> 07:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board so that is
 
07:08:43.730 --> 07:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
actually interestingly enough not
 
07:08:45.590 --> 07:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
changed our numbers in a way that we've
 
07:08:48.350 --> 07:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
observed so it may mean that folks who
 
07:08:51.350 --> 07:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
are looking for that process are filing
 
07:08:53.868 --> 07:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
an appeal where they weren't before but
 
07:08:55.730 --> 07:08:55.740 align:start position:0%
the same number of folks appear to still
 
07:08:59.330 --> 07:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
be filing in the Superior Court
 
07:09:01.730 --> 07:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
um one other thing I would just well I
 
07:09:05.510 --> 07:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
guess with that I would uh
 
07:09:07.368 --> 07:09:07.378 align:start position:0%
in my comments but be happy to answer
 
07:09:10.010 --> 07:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:12.350 --> 07:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
07:09:14.750 --> 07:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
07:09:18.770 --> 07:09:18.780 align:start position:0%
congratulations I am thrilled at the
 
07:09:21.170 --> 07:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
strengths of which you've endorsed this
 
07:09:24.170 --> 07:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
bill I also want to congratulate you on
 
07:09:26.810 --> 07:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
the accuracy of the language in the
 
07:09:29.930 --> 07:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
fiscal note because it says that your
 
07:09:32.570 --> 07:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
judicial branch assumes
 
07:09:35.810 --> 07:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
an additional judge it does not
 
07:09:38.930 --> 07:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
and it does not say that there will be
 
07:09:40.968 --> 07:09:40.978 align:start position:0%
an additional judge and I wrote that
 
07:09:42.830 --> 07:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal note because of that exact reason
 
07:09:45.770 --> 07:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for that and I also
 
07:09:47.628 --> 07:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
congratulate you on the fact that the
 
07:09:50.570 --> 07:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
chairman of division one is a co-sponsor
 
07:09:53.570 --> 07:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
of this bill and um division one in
 
07:09:56.030 --> 07:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
finance and therefore
 
07:09:58.368 --> 07:09:58.378 align:start position:0%
um understands the importance of that
 
07:10:01.730 --> 07:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
bill so all that is very good I have I'm
 
07:10:03.288 --> 07:10:03.298 align:start position:0%
afraid with all those positive things
 
07:10:07.448 --> 07:10:07.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:11.150 --> 07:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
well well you know first I have to get
 
07:10:13.128 --> 07:10:13.138 align:start position:0%
permission to ask the next
 
07:10:16.610 --> 07:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
I have permission could you tell me do
 
07:10:22.368 --> 07:10:22.378 align:start position:0%
you have a full 23 judges we have 22. I
 
07:10:25.010 --> 07:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
mean 22. and that includes the the Chief
 
07:10:27.170 --> 07:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
Justice of the spirit court so she also
 
07:10:28.910 --> 07:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
has the administrative duties associated
 
07:10:31.548 --> 07:10:31.558 align:start position:0%
with that and how current and this is
 
07:10:33.650 --> 07:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
part of something how current is your
 
07:10:37.070 --> 07:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
value your caseload evaluation for the
 
07:10:39.590 --> 07:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
court and where does it stand in terms
 
07:10:43.128 --> 07:10:43.138 align:start position:0%
of the length of time for all those
 
07:10:46.310 --> 07:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
other cases that don't necessarily deal
 
07:10:49.070 --> 07:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
with property but might deal with more
 
07:10:51.048 --> 07:10:51.058 align:start position:0%
human kinds of questions
 
07:10:52.788 --> 07:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question if I
 
07:10:54.048 --> 07:10:54.058 align:start position:0%
understand one
 
07:10:55.670 --> 07:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
if I'm not answering the question I
 
07:10:58.128 --> 07:10:58.138 align:start position:0%
apologize we have very recently this in
 
07:11:00.650 --> 07:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
last year completed uh what's called a
 
07:11:02.510 --> 07:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
weighted case study
 
07:11:05.390 --> 07:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
um and that weighted case study did a a
 
07:11:08.628 --> 07:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
very detailed evaluation of all of the
 
07:11:10.788 --> 07:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
cases both Superior Court and circuit
 
07:11:13.610 --> 07:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
court and evaluated the time needed per
 
07:11:13.620 --> 07:11:14.690 align:start position:0%
court and evaluated the time needed per
case

07:11:14.690 --> 07:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
case
 
07:11:17.330 --> 07:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
um and and the number of resources we
 
07:11:18.730 --> 07:11:18.740 align:start position:0%
currently have available
 
07:11:21.708 --> 07:11:21.718 align:start position:0%
and as as representative Lynn suggested
 
07:11:25.368 --> 07:11:25.378 align:start position:0%
in our budget our budget recognizes what
 
07:11:27.350 --> 07:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
that weighted case study found which is
 
07:11:29.090 --> 07:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
in the Circuit Court we are
 
07:11:31.490 --> 07:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
substantially down in terms of judges
 
07:11:33.890 --> 07:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
and staff in the Superior Court which is
 
07:11:36.468 --> 07:11:36.478 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about today the
 
07:11:38.330 --> 07:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
number of Judges that we are deficient
 
07:11:40.090 --> 07:11:40.100 align:start position:0%
is about three and a half
 
07:11:44.690 --> 07:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
our budget only asks for one in in it
 
07:11:47.628 --> 07:11:47.638 align:start position:0%
would be tied to this bill which would
 
07:11:49.368 --> 07:11:49.378 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to be tied to this bill if
 
07:11:52.968 --> 07:11:52.978 align:start position:0%
this bill were not to pass but the goal
 
07:11:55.548 --> 07:11:55.558 align:start position:0%
would be that the new judge would take
 
07:11:59.090 --> 07:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
on this land use docket that does have a
 
07:12:01.548 --> 07:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
ripple effect through the system of of
 
07:12:03.708 --> 07:12:03.718 align:start position:0%
not having the other judges handling
 
07:12:06.048 --> 07:12:06.058 align:start position:0%
these types of cases which tend to be
 
07:12:10.070 --> 07:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
time consuming and and detailed so so at
 
07:12:11.930 --> 07:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
least the other judges would not be
 
07:12:14.270 --> 07:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
doing this docket
 
07:12:17.448 --> 07:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
um but it so but overall
 
07:12:19.548 --> 07:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
um the the way the case study showed
 
07:12:21.110 --> 07:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
that we were deficient in terms of the
 
07:12:23.628 --> 07:12:23.638 align:start position:0%
number of Judges number of Staff in both
 
07:12:25.670 --> 07:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
and by about three and a half in the in
 
07:12:28.310 --> 07:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
the spirit Court just an elaboration on
 
07:12:29.930 --> 07:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
that one so you're short three and a
 
07:12:32.930 --> 07:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
half judges you've decided that you
 
07:12:36.048 --> 07:12:36.058 align:start position:0%
would like to get one judge leaving you
 
07:12:38.750 --> 07:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
still two and a half short and that one
 
07:12:41.810 --> 07:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
judge would focus on these cases could
 
07:12:43.730 --> 07:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
you give the committee particularly the
 
07:12:45.650 --> 07:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
new members of the committee some idea
 
07:12:49.250 --> 07:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
of the cases that therefore will not be
 
07:12:52.190 --> 07:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
handled in the timely way that you would
 
07:12:54.830 --> 07:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
like them to be handled
 
07:12:57.590 --> 07:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh I apologize I may have that would not
 
07:12:59.810 --> 07:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
be handled in a timely way yes because
 
07:13:01.788 --> 07:13:01.798 align:start position:0%
your short two and a half judges I'm
 
07:13:04.670 --> 07:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
sorry I I get what you're saying um so
 
07:13:06.708 --> 07:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
we would have an overall Improvement in
 
07:13:09.468 --> 07:13:09.478 align:start position:0%
the system I think the and the Chief
 
07:13:11.690 --> 07:13:11.700 align:start position:0%
Justice would speak to this in in his
 
07:13:13.548 --> 07:13:13.558 align:start position:0%
comments when he's presenting the budget
 
07:13:16.310 --> 07:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to speak for him so
 
07:13:18.708 --> 07:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
um how he balance that out to be one
 
07:13:21.590 --> 07:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
judge instead of three and a half versus
 
07:13:24.530 --> 07:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
you know the same analysis that he had
 
07:13:26.690 --> 07:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
to do with the circuit court and come up
 
07:13:28.548 --> 07:13:28.558 align:start position:0%
with a number I would leave that to the
 
07:13:30.590 --> 07:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice in his presentation on the
 
07:13:32.330 --> 07:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
budget as to how he made that balance
 
07:13:34.730 --> 07:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't want to speak for
 
07:13:36.948 --> 07:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
him perfectly legitimate response thank
 
07:13:39.770 --> 07:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Horrigan
 
07:13:41.570 --> 07:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much Mr chair thank
 
07:13:43.968 --> 07:13:43.978 align:start position:0%
you much attorney head um so the
 
07:13:45.650 --> 07:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
effective day for this bill is January
 
07:13:47.628 --> 07:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
1st 2024
 
07:13:47.638 --> 07:13:48.230 align:start position:0%
1st 2024
um

07:13:48.230 --> 07:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:50.690 --> 07:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
it'll take a while to uh recruit the
 
07:13:53.448 --> 07:13:53.458 align:start position:0%
candidates and convince the governor to
 
07:13:55.128 --> 07:13:55.138 align:start position:0%
appoint one of them and to get them past
 
07:13:56.628 --> 07:13:56.638 align:start position:0%
the executive Council and all the other
 
07:13:58.070 --> 07:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
steps so like
 
07:14:00.350 --> 07:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
well that process be able to begin in
 
07:14:02.150 --> 07:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
the second half of
 
07:14:05.208 --> 07:14:05.218 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2023 after we passed this
 
07:14:07.250 --> 07:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
bill or does that have to wait until
 
07:14:09.830 --> 07:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2024 before you can get that
 
07:14:11.810 --> 07:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
whole process rolling which could take
 
07:14:11.820 --> 07:14:13.730 align:start position:0%
whole process rolling which could take
months

07:14:13.730 --> 07:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
months
 
07:14:16.190 --> 07:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question I I think
 
07:14:16.200 --> 07:14:17.390 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question I I think
the

07:14:17.390 --> 07:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:14:19.430 --> 07:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
um the docket would not be created until
 
07:14:22.190 --> 07:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
the judge came on board and was
 
07:14:24.650 --> 07:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
appointed and had begun the position and
 
07:14:26.810 --> 07:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
that that new judge would initiate the
 
07:14:28.968 --> 07:14:28.978 align:start position:0%
docket whether that occurs before or
 
07:14:30.968 --> 07:14:30.978 align:start position:0%
after January 1
 
07:14:34.368 --> 07:14:34.378 align:start position:0%
you know whatever that date is uh that's
 
07:14:36.948 --> 07:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
when we would initiate the creation of
 
07:14:39.948 --> 07:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:42.650 --> 07:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
if I understood you can start trying to
 
07:14:46.070 --> 07:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
get the individual in place uh as soon
 
07:14:48.830 --> 07:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
as this bill passes or as I suspect
 
07:14:50.868 --> 07:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
might happen it ends up inspired the
 
07:14:53.930 --> 07:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
budget and it would begin as soon as the
 
07:14:56.930 --> 07:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
budget was was passed and and uh in the
 
07:14:58.730 --> 07:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
nomination process then would take over
 
07:15:01.548 --> 07:15:01.558 align:start position:0%
that's correct it wouldn't be there
 
07:15:03.170 --> 07:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be in the budget the same delay
 
07:15:05.330 --> 07:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
of January 1 before the judge could be
 
07:15:08.750 --> 07:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
nominated and appointed
 
07:15:11.030 --> 07:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative qatab
 
07:15:14.090 --> 07:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
07:15:17.510 --> 07:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
I see an RSA 491-1 that it currently
 
07:15:20.030 --> 07:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
remarks 21 associate judges you had just
 
07:15:21.948 --> 07:15:21.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
07:15:23.810 --> 07:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
um we currently have 22 and would Dean
 
07:15:24.830 --> 07:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
23 I just want to make sure that I'm
 
07:15:26.150 --> 07:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
hearing that correctly was there one
 
07:15:27.770 --> 07:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
that came from somewhere else I may have
 
07:15:31.310 --> 07:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
in and either my memory is off or or it
 
07:15:35.390 --> 07:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
may say 20 21 associate and one Chief uh
 
07:15:38.090 --> 07:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
or it does say a chief in 2010 that's
 
07:15:39.708 --> 07:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
where I'm getting the 22 so I'm adding
 
07:15:43.208 --> 07:15:43.218 align:start position:0%
uh judge Netto in my 22 so I may have
 
07:15:46.730 --> 07:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
the language would would say achieve and
 
07:15:49.670 --> 07:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
then probably 20 22. okay perfect thank
 
07:15:49.680 --> 07:15:50.570 align:start position:0%
then probably 20 22. okay perfect thank
you

07:15:50.570 --> 07:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:15:50.580 --> 07:15:51.948 align:start position:0%
you
foreign

07:15:51.948 --> 07:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:15:51.958 --> 07:15:56.448 align:start position:0%
foreign
ahead

07:15:56.448 --> 07:15:56.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:02.030 --> 07:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:05.690 --> 07:16:05.700 align:start position:0%
in a day's time of the land of this
 
07:16:05.700 --> 07:16:06.708 align:start position:0%
in a day's time of the land of this
would

07:16:06.708 --> 07:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
would
 
07:16:12.250 --> 07:16:12.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:15.170 --> 07:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
cases you mean in terms of trial time
 
07:16:17.510 --> 07:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know the answer to that I
 
07:16:19.968 --> 07:16:19.978 align:start position:0%
do know the vast majority of these
 
07:16:22.788 --> 07:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
results have evidentiary hearings as
 
07:16:24.530 --> 07:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
opposed to just simply on paper and
 
07:16:24.540 --> 07:16:25.628 align:start position:0%
opposed to just simply on paper and
argument

07:16:25.628 --> 07:16:25.638 align:start position:0%
argument
 
07:16:29.628 --> 07:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearings uh take longer but
 
07:16:32.150 --> 07:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
it and so I don't know whether or not
 
07:16:34.190 --> 07:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
they tend to extend beyond one day or
 
07:16:36.048 --> 07:16:36.058 align:start position:0%
they're typically done within one day I
 
07:16:39.368 --> 07:16:39.378 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that I
 
07:16:43.250 --> 07:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
so by having an extra Superior Court
 
07:16:47.150 --> 07:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
Judge it will help to free up the the
 
07:16:50.030 --> 07:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
time that other cases would be heard to
 
07:16:52.730 --> 07:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
have just to have him just focus in on
 
07:16:52.740 --> 07:16:54.110 align:start position:0%
have just to have him just focus in on
this

07:16:54.110 --> 07:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:16:56.868 --> 07:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
so so I think the the
 
07:16:59.990 --> 07:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
new judge would hear all of the land use
 
07:17:02.090 --> 07:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
appeals um so all of them would would
 
07:17:05.090 --> 07:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
get Consolidated there that naturally
 
07:17:06.590 --> 07:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
has the effect of taking that off
 
07:17:09.048 --> 07:17:09.058 align:start position:0%
somebody else's docket who that where it
 
07:17:12.530 --> 07:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
would normally be assigned and uh every
 
07:17:16.548 --> 07:17:16.558 align:start position:0%
judge in the superior court system has a
 
07:17:19.930 --> 07:17:19.940 align:start position:0%
just a very large caseload so they would
 
07:17:22.368 --> 07:17:22.378 align:start position:0%
have whatever time would have been
 
07:17:24.468 --> 07:17:24.478 align:start position:0%
allocated to a land use docket case
 
07:17:27.530 --> 07:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
would now be allocated to a civil case a
 
07:17:29.208 --> 07:17:29.218 align:start position:0%
criminal case some other case that
 
07:17:31.670 --> 07:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
exists on their docket can I ask one
 
07:17:35.448 --> 07:17:35.458 align:start position:0%
other question how many how many judges
 
07:17:38.030 --> 07:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
do you have working in one day
 
07:17:40.548 --> 07:17:40.558 align:start position:0%
all of them so yes everybody is working
 
07:17:42.708 --> 07:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
throughout the system at all times one
 
07:17:44.868 --> 07:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
thing I would just point out it the
 
07:17:47.090 --> 07:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
judge's time is not simply trial time
 
07:17:50.628 --> 07:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
there there are hearings pleadings uh a
 
07:17:53.448 --> 07:17:53.458 align:start position:0%
great deal of one of the aspects of what
 
07:17:57.770 --> 07:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
makes these very complex is a very uh a
 
07:17:59.830 --> 07:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
significant record comes as
 
07:18:01.850 --> 07:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn said you get the
 
07:18:04.010 --> 07:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
record from below those can be
 
07:18:05.330 --> 07:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
especially in a very complicated
 
07:18:11.090 --> 07:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
commercial case very thick and it is the
 
07:18:12.948 --> 07:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
duty of the judge to become very
 
07:18:14.990 --> 07:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with the facts and and details
 
07:18:17.810 --> 07:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
of those of those cases so it is not
 
07:18:19.850 --> 07:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
just the time the judge spends in the
 
07:18:21.948 --> 07:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
court that is cons that consumes their
 
07:18:26.390 --> 07:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
time in these types of cases thank you
 
07:18:28.850 --> 07:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
07:18:32.448 --> 07:18:32.458 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr chairman
 
07:18:38.868 --> 07:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:40.730 --> 07:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Vice
 
07:18:42.468 --> 07:18:42.478 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you members of the
 
07:18:43.850 --> 07:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Greg
 
07:18:44.990 --> 07:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
Moore I'm the state director with
 
07:18:46.788 --> 07:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity here in New
 
07:18:49.670 --> 07:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I realize that I'm
 
07:18:51.110 --> 07:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
probably the last witness in the last
 
07:18:52.968 --> 07:18:52.978 align:start position:0%
bill when all of you are trying to get
 
07:18:55.670 --> 07:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
home and beat the storm so oh it's so
 
07:18:57.350 --> 07:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
good so there are other people okay so I
 
07:18:59.510 --> 07:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
can blame them uh for the record uh
 
07:19:00.830 --> 07:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
again Greg Morris state director of
 
07:19:02.570 --> 07:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
America Prosperity here to testify and
 
07:19:05.330 --> 07:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 347. uh we view
 
07:19:07.670 --> 07:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
this as a critical critical step for
 
07:19:09.410 --> 07:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
promoting economic growth in New
 
07:19:11.570 --> 07:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire having the chance to go and
 
07:19:13.010 --> 07:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
talk to a number of Business Leaders
 
07:19:15.468 --> 07:19:15.478 align:start position:0%
business owners Community leaders one of
 
07:19:16.850 --> 07:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
the biggest problems that's facing the
 
07:19:18.350 --> 07:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire right now is just
 
07:19:20.448 --> 07:19:20.458 align:start position:0%
the issue of development issue of
 
07:19:23.270 --> 07:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
development at large now obviously the
 
07:19:25.128 --> 07:19:25.138 align:start position:0%
housing component against a Lion's Share
 
07:19:26.930 --> 07:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
of the headlines but there is a real
 
07:19:28.670 --> 07:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
problem in terms of development in the
 
07:19:30.590 --> 07:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial space as well and
 
07:19:32.448 --> 07:19:32.458 align:start position:0%
I know this legislature has taken action
 
07:19:34.548 --> 07:19:34.558 align:start position:0%
on on the on the issue of housing
 
07:19:36.468 --> 07:19:36.478 align:start position:0%
starting with the passage of the housing
 
07:19:39.170 --> 07:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
appeals board in 2019 as well as the The
 
07:19:41.150 --> 07:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
house's creation of a special committee
 
07:19:43.250 --> 07:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
on housing which indicates the level of
 
07:19:45.530 --> 07:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
seriousness and focus which which the
 
07:19:47.448 --> 07:19:47.458 align:start position:0%
legislature has placed on this issue but
 
07:19:49.010 --> 07:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
I would suggest to you that building
 
07:19:50.750 --> 07:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
more housing without supporting that
 
07:19:52.310 --> 07:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
with commercial and industrial property
 
07:19:53.810 --> 07:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
as well is going to be a problem long
 
07:19:57.410 --> 07:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
term so having the ability to to have a
 
07:20:00.110 --> 07:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
quick access to to judgment for these
 
07:20:01.910 --> 07:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
people in commercial industrial as well
 
07:20:04.070 --> 07:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
as those folks who are seeking the
 
07:20:05.810 --> 07:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
housing route and want to go down go
 
07:20:07.788 --> 07:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
down to actually sit in front of a judge
 
07:20:09.530 --> 07:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
as a have the day in front of a judge as
 
07:20:11.510 --> 07:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to a housing appeals board I
 
07:20:13.070 --> 07:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
think this creates a great opportunity
 
07:20:15.110 --> 07:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
relative to the dynamic but with the
 
07:20:16.250 --> 07:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board I want to point
 
07:20:18.288 --> 07:20:18.298 align:start position:0%
out that I had a chance to talk to the
 
07:20:20.570 --> 07:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
the leadership of both the New Hampshire
 
07:20:23.208 --> 07:20:23.218 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire homeowner Home Builders
 
07:20:25.730 --> 07:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
Association as well as the associated
 
07:20:27.650 --> 07:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
builders and contractors and they are
 
07:20:29.030 --> 07:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
fully in support of this legislation
 
07:20:31.368 --> 07:20:31.378 align:start position:0%
they suggested that they signed in I
 
07:20:32.990 --> 07:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
haven't checked so I apologize for not
 
07:20:35.208 --> 07:20:35.218 align:start position:0%
doing my homework but the home builders
 
07:20:36.288 --> 07:20:36.298 align:start position:0%
and the associated builders and
 
07:20:37.548 --> 07:20:37.558 align:start position:0%
contractors are in support of this
 
07:20:37.558 --> 07:20:39.530 align:start position:0%
contractors are in support of this
legislation

07:20:39.530 --> 07:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
07:20:41.448 --> 07:20:41.458 align:start position:0%
the problem with the current system is
 
07:20:43.128 --> 07:20:43.138 align:start position:0%
in terms of land use and this is an I
 
07:20:44.868 --> 07:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to talk with the
 
07:20:46.310 --> 07:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice and he says the problem is
 
07:20:48.048 --> 07:20:48.058 align:start position:0%
that in land use cases they go right to
 
07:20:50.090 --> 07:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the docket
 
07:20:52.010 --> 07:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
be coupling that with the fact that they
 
07:20:54.048 --> 07:20:54.058 align:start position:0%
are very complicated very dense cases as
 
07:20:55.670 --> 07:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
we've heard before
 
07:20:57.708 --> 07:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
leads to very long delays to getting
 
07:20:57.718 --> 07:20:59.090 align:start position:0%
leads to very long delays to getting
results

07:20:59.090 --> 07:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
results
 
07:21:01.010 --> 07:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
I've heard that that uh from several
 
07:21:03.070 --> 07:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
people that if you want to bring a case
 
07:21:06.230 --> 07:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
on in Superior Court you're lucky to get
 
07:21:08.090 --> 07:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
into trial in a year and a half
 
07:21:10.310 --> 07:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
and you probably won't get a full result
 
07:21:11.990 --> 07:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
for about three years
 
07:21:13.730 --> 07:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
now the problem if you're a developer is
 
07:21:15.530 --> 07:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
is that if you have to wait three years
 
07:21:17.690 --> 07:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
between the time when there's been a
 
07:21:21.110 --> 07:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
potential uh a potential violation of of
 
07:21:22.850 --> 07:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
the statutes bio zoning and planning
 
07:21:24.770 --> 07:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
board and they get Justice your your
 
07:21:26.628 --> 07:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
financing can't hold together for three
 
07:21:28.850 --> 07:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
years correct so it has the it is
 
07:21:31.090 --> 07:21:31.100 align:start position:0%
essentially a sort of a veto power over
 
07:21:34.968 --> 07:21:34.978 align:start position:0%
uh over your ability to build this
 
07:21:36.948 --> 07:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
speeds up the process which could
 
07:21:38.868 --> 07:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
potentially be as fast as five months if
 
07:21:40.190 --> 07:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
it is if there's not too much of a
 
07:21:44.030 --> 07:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
record sent uh into to to Superior Court
 
07:21:47.208 --> 07:21:47.218 align:start position:0%
moreover by having one judge having one
 
07:21:50.150 --> 07:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
judge handling all the cases you'll get
 
07:21:53.090 --> 07:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
a a level of consistency of rulings
 
07:21:55.430 --> 07:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
across the board so if there's one judge
 
07:21:57.350 --> 07:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
right now there are potentially 22
 
07:21:57.360 --> 07:21:58.490 align:start position:0%
right now there are potentially 22
judges

07:21:58.490 --> 07:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
judges
 
07:22:00.770 --> 07:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
who might have 22 particular versions of
 
07:22:02.690 --> 07:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
how they view how they view the statute
 
07:22:04.730 --> 07:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
by having it all run through one judge
 
07:22:05.930 --> 07:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a level of
 
07:22:07.070 --> 07:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
consistency and that level of
 
07:22:09.230 --> 07:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
consistency is going to actually be a
 
07:22:10.788 --> 07:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
great benefit to the zoning and planning
 
07:22:12.650 --> 07:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
boards across the state because everyone
 
07:22:14.628 --> 07:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
will know and understand what the rules
 
07:22:14.638 --> 07:22:15.850 align:start position:0%
will know and understand what the rules
are

07:22:15.850 --> 07:22:15.860 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:22:18.890 --> 07:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
as as I know this this committee has
 
07:22:20.570 --> 07:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
debated in years past I know
 
07:22:22.190 --> 07:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander who's not here
 
07:22:25.070 --> 07:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
filed legislation two years ago to have
 
07:22:27.110 --> 07:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory training for zoning and
 
07:22:29.390 --> 07:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
planning boards uh that legislation did
 
07:22:31.610 --> 07:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
not pass but there's a sense of
 
07:22:34.190 --> 07:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
unevenness and that unevenness can lead
 
07:22:36.170 --> 07:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
to results that might fall outside of
 
07:22:38.270 --> 07:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
the statutory authority of the zoning
 
07:22:40.070 --> 07:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
and planning boards and if that happens
 
07:22:43.010 --> 07:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
and the recourse is to go get to wait
 
07:22:45.110 --> 07:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
three years before you get a result on
 
07:22:47.628 --> 07:22:47.638 align:start position:0%
that on that potential violation that's
 
07:22:49.190 --> 07:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
from our perspective that's not really
 
07:22:50.750 --> 07:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
what we would describe as Justice
 
07:22:52.670 --> 07:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
because because if you're financing
 
07:22:54.230 --> 07:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
can't hold together for that period of
 
07:22:56.090 --> 07:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
time you're not likely to be able to
 
07:22:57.830 --> 07:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
07:23:00.350 --> 07:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh I would also just uh just like to say
 
07:23:02.990 --> 07:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
that uh I'll give you an example of of
 
07:23:04.128 --> 07:23:04.138 align:start position:0%
what I'm talking about because I think
 
07:23:05.628 --> 07:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
it's great to talk about this in a
 
07:23:08.930 --> 07:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
theoretical but just in terms of of what
 
07:23:10.548 --> 07:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
what how this works in the practical
 
07:23:12.048 --> 07:23:12.058 align:start position:0%
sense and I'll use my hometown because
 
07:23:13.070 --> 07:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
if you're going to pick on somebody's
 
07:23:15.530 --> 07:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
telling you should pick on your own uh I
 
07:23:17.570 --> 07:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
live a town of Bedford a local Brewery
 
07:23:19.128 --> 07:23:19.138 align:start position:0%
was looking to do an expansion in the
 
07:23:20.810 --> 07:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
town of Bedford they were looking to do
 
07:23:22.070 --> 07:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
it in their performance Zone which is
 
07:23:24.110 --> 07:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
the area designated by the town to be
 
07:23:26.990 --> 07:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
the area for development and uh to in
 
07:23:28.670 --> 07:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
order to enhance the town's overall tax
 
07:23:28.680 --> 07:23:30.048 align:start position:0%
order to enhance the town's overall tax
base

07:23:30.048 --> 07:23:30.058 align:start position:0%
base
 
07:23:31.850 --> 07:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
they went before the they went before
 
07:23:33.770 --> 07:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
the the planning board the planning
 
07:23:34.730 --> 07:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
board said that they were going to have
 
07:23:36.170 --> 07:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
to require them
 
07:23:40.310 --> 07:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
to to uh put uh two feet of a fill in
 
07:23:42.048 --> 07:23:42.058 align:start position:0%
the back part of the property by the way
 
07:23:43.368 --> 07:23:43.378 align:start position:0%
that's the part of the property that
 
07:23:45.770 --> 07:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
that uh would not be where they would
 
07:23:47.690 --> 07:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
actually be putting a building
 
07:23:50.030 --> 07:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
and it would add up to a cost of two
 
07:23:51.410 --> 07:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars before they could even
 
07:23:52.910 --> 07:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
break the ground to build a foundation
 
07:23:54.650 --> 07:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
so adding two million dollars to the
 
07:23:56.030 --> 07:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
cost of the project
 
07:23:59.030 --> 07:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh at this point and I should add that
 
07:24:00.350 --> 07:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
that the attorney for the for the
 
07:24:02.810 --> 07:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
brewery said that there's no statutory
 
07:24:06.230 --> 07:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
support for for requiring that now
 
07:24:08.690 --> 07:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
instead of instead of building it what
 
07:24:10.250 --> 07:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
happened is is that the brewery just
 
07:24:12.288 --> 07:24:12.298 align:start position:0%
decided to scrap the plans as opposed to
 
07:24:14.690 --> 07:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
trying to take go to court and and uh
 
07:24:17.090 --> 07:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
have that ruling overturned
 
07:24:19.548 --> 07:24:19.558 align:start position:0%
that's results obviously in in a
 
07:24:21.288 --> 07:24:21.298 align:start position:0%
situation where somebody was out over a
 
07:24:22.850 --> 07:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in design and
 
07:24:24.770 --> 07:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
legal fees for to bring this to the
 
07:24:26.570 --> 07:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
board and that whole plan was scrapped
 
07:24:29.030 --> 07:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
and they lost all that money uh despite
 
07:24:30.468 --> 07:24:30.478 align:start position:0%
the fact that at least in the the
 
07:24:32.090 --> 07:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
opinion of the attorney for the for the
 
07:24:35.208 --> 07:24:35.218 align:start position:0%
uh the brewery that the the request of
 
07:24:37.128 --> 07:24:37.138 align:start position:0%
this planning board was not somebody was
 
07:24:39.230 --> 07:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
supported under statute they exceeded
 
07:24:41.570 --> 07:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
their statutory Authority so that I just
 
07:24:43.250 --> 07:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
want to put a real world sort of example
 
07:24:45.890 --> 07:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
as to what that looks like and and
 
07:24:47.390 --> 07:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's a project that didn't get done
 
07:24:49.670 --> 07:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
simply simply because of the ruling by
 
07:24:52.128 --> 07:24:52.138 align:start position:0%
that board so uh with that and again I
 
07:24:53.570 --> 07:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
know I want to be quick here because you
 
07:24:55.490 --> 07:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
all want to get out of here uh happy to
 
07:24:57.650 --> 07:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
07:24:59.330 --> 07:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
07:24:59.340 --> 07:25:01.190 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
naturally

07:25:01.190 --> 07:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
naturally
 
07:25:04.490 --> 07:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
um Mr Moore it's good to see you and I
 
07:25:06.890 --> 07:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
think we all agree that Justice delayed
 
07:25:09.350 --> 07:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
is Justice denied
 
07:25:12.530 --> 07:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
um assuming that this bill passes and
 
07:25:14.150 --> 07:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's every reason to believe it will
 
07:25:17.030 --> 07:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
and it comes into law
 
07:25:22.128 --> 07:25:22.138 align:start position:0%
can you give us guidance as to what
 
07:25:25.250 --> 07:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
civil and criminal cases
 
07:25:29.030 --> 07:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
you think could now
 
07:25:32.090 --> 07:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
um in effect go to the
 
07:25:35.868 --> 07:25:35.878 align:start position:0%
the bottom of of the the list of KF
 
07:25:38.930 --> 07:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
pending cases and
 
07:25:41.990 --> 07:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
making clear that we will benefit from
 
07:25:46.610 --> 07:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
the The increased uh speed in the cases
 
07:25:49.390 --> 07:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
that go here to the land use review
 
07:25:52.250 --> 07:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
understanding that the other cases
 
07:25:55.368 --> 07:25:55.378 align:start position:0%
with a long backlog and a shortage of
 
07:25:58.430 --> 07:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
Two and a Half judges what areas do you
 
07:26:01.788 --> 07:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
think it's justifiable to now have those
 
07:26:04.490 --> 07:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
cases take more time
 
07:26:05.270 --> 07:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
07:26:07.250 --> 07:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative uh did I really mean that
 
07:26:09.650 --> 07:26:09.660 align:start position:0%
do you I do I do
 
07:26:09.660 --> 07:26:11.150 align:start position:0%
do you I do I do
uh

07:26:11.150 --> 07:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:26:12.530 --> 07:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
I've had a lot of chance to answer
 
07:26:14.448 --> 07:26:14.458 align:start position:0%
questions for Youth of the years as you
 
07:26:14.458 --> 07:26:15.430 align:start position:0%
questions for Youth of the years as you
know

07:26:15.430 --> 07:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
07:26:20.030 --> 07:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
I work for a state agency once and uh
 
07:26:22.070 --> 07:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's always fun when they tell you to to
 
07:26:23.750 --> 07:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
paint the bar and only give you one
 
07:26:26.750 --> 07:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
gallon of paint I I but but
 
07:26:29.628 --> 07:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
to the to the question at hand
 
07:26:32.390 --> 07:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
if this is adding a judge and you're
 
07:26:32.400 --> 07:26:33.350 align:start position:0%
if this is adding a judge and you're
taking

07:26:33.350 --> 07:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
taking
 
07:26:35.750 --> 07:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
work off the plate of the existing
 
07:26:38.090 --> 07:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
Superior Court judges then I think it's
 
07:26:39.890 --> 07:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
going to benefit the speed with which
 
07:26:41.570 --> 07:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
those other cases are able to move
 
07:26:44.150 --> 07:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
through the courts I I I think that
 
07:26:45.468 --> 07:26:45.478 align:start position:0%
that's helpful
 
07:26:47.448 --> 07:26:47.458 align:start position:0%
there's a secondary question I think
 
07:26:50.750 --> 07:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
embedded in there of whether adding one
 
07:26:53.030 --> 07:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
more Supreme Court Justice is the right
 
07:26:53.040 --> 07:26:54.410 align:start position:0%
more Supreme Court Justice is the right
answer

07:26:54.410 --> 07:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
answer
 
07:26:56.270 --> 07:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
um the folks down the hall the ones who
 
07:26:59.330 --> 07:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
have to Grapple with that and uh but but
 
07:27:01.910 --> 07:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
to your point I don't think that the
 
07:27:04.010 --> 07:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
other the other dockets will be slowed
 
07:27:05.030 --> 07:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
down I don't think the other cases will
 
07:27:06.410 --> 07:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
be in fact I think they'll be sped up
 
07:27:09.110 --> 07:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
because all these land use cases will be
 
07:27:12.310 --> 07:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
taken off of the other 22
 
07:27:15.468 --> 07:27:15.478 align:start position:0%
spherical justices but I I do agree with
 
07:27:18.350 --> 07:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
your point about and to attorney head's
 
07:27:19.670 --> 07:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
point about making sure you change that
 
07:27:21.230 --> 07:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
other statute to make abundantly clear
 
07:27:23.150 --> 07:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
the intent of this committee to add
 
07:27:27.650 --> 07:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:30.048 --> 07:27:30.058 align:start position:0%
representative guitar
 
07:27:31.670 --> 07:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Mr
 
07:27:35.030 --> 07:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
Moore I apologize I I misunderstood a
 
07:27:37.010 --> 07:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
little bit what was the two million
 
07:27:38.510 --> 07:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
dollar thing that Bedford wanted the
 
07:27:41.810 --> 07:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
brewery to put in so this is this was on
 
07:27:43.368 --> 07:27:43.378 align:start position:0%
River Road which is part of the
 
07:27:45.910 --> 07:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
performance Zone in Bedford and it's a
 
07:27:48.830 --> 07:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
piece of property that abuts against the
 
07:27:51.468 --> 07:27:51.478 align:start position:0%
Everett Turnpike and there's a front
 
07:27:54.170 --> 07:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
developer developable part that a butts
 
07:27:55.788 --> 07:27:55.798 align:start position:0%
that sits on River Road horses which is
 
07:27:59.090 --> 07:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh route 3. and behind it is sort of a
 
07:28:01.968 --> 07:28:01.978 align:start position:0%
gully that goes underneath to ever ever
 
07:28:04.070 --> 07:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
turnpike now the property extends all
 
07:28:05.868 --> 07:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
the way to the turnpike
 
07:28:08.510 --> 07:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
and so they they demanded that they had
 
07:28:09.830 --> 07:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
that if they wanted to go forward the
 
07:28:11.750 --> 07:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
project that they had to fill all that
 
07:28:13.570 --> 07:28:13.580 align:start position:0%
and now none
 
07:28:15.530 --> 07:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
fill it entirely
 
07:28:19.190 --> 07:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
and and uh none of that area was the
 
07:28:21.110 --> 07:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
area that that the brewery was looking
 
07:28:22.490 --> 07:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
at using they were looking at using the
 
07:28:24.830 --> 07:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
footprint closer to towards the highway
 
07:28:29.868 --> 07:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:32.030 --> 07:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
07:28:35.150 --> 07:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
CNN we thank you thank you and we now

um thank you for hearing my testimony
 
07:29:03.530 --> 07:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
our broad Coalition does not have a
 
07:29:05.628 --> 07:29:05.638 align:start position:0%
formal position on this proposal House
 
07:29:08.990 --> 07:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 347 but we would respectfully ask
 
07:29:11.030 --> 07:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
this committee to consider amending the
 
07:29:13.368 --> 07:29:13.378 align:start position:0%
bill to make clear that this proposal
 
07:29:15.110 --> 07:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
would not in any way supplant the
 
07:29:17.930 --> 07:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board
 
07:29:19.670 --> 07:29:19.680 align:start position:0%

07:29:25.670 --> 07:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
language for your consideration
 
07:29:29.150 --> 07:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
as you know in his um uh chairman Lynn
 
07:29:31.610 --> 07:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
pointed out in his testimony many
 
07:29:33.468 --> 07:29:33.478 align:start position:0%
parties seeking review of Municipal
 
07:29:35.208 --> 07:29:35.218 align:start position:0%
decisions whether that be at the Bureau
 
07:29:36.948 --> 07:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
of tax and land appeals that's been in
 
07:29:41.030 --> 07:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:42.650 --> 07:29:42.660 align:start position:0%
that's all right or the housing appeals
 
07:29:45.590 --> 07:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
board since 2020 are benefiting now from
 
07:29:48.048 --> 07:29:48.058 align:start position:0%
timely Fair inexpensive and accessible
 
07:29:48.058 --> 07:29:49.208 align:start position:0%
timely Fair inexpensive and accessible
access

07:29:49.208 --> 07:29:49.218 align:start position:0%
access
 
07:29:51.948 --> 07:29:51.958 align:start position:0%
the benefiting parties in the case of
 
07:29:53.628 --> 07:29:53.638 align:start position:0%
housing are not only a Butters but
 
07:29:55.310 --> 07:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
they're taxpayers property owners and
 
07:29:57.770 --> 07:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
developers we're starting to hear that
 
07:29:59.330 --> 07:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
municipalities are seeing the benefit
 
07:30:02.868 --> 07:30:02.878 align:start position:0%
benefit of Speedy review as well
 
07:30:06.410 --> 07:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
so um we feel like there's been a lot of
 
07:30:09.110 --> 07:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
progress a lot of needed education in
 
07:30:10.490 --> 07:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
terms of what the housing appeals board
 
07:30:12.708 --> 07:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
does and what it does not it certainly
 
07:30:15.288 --> 07:30:15.298 align:start position:0%
has a busy docket we don't doubt that
 
07:30:17.468 --> 07:30:17.478 align:start position:0%
the superior court has one as well
 
07:30:20.270 --> 07:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
and so would ask that you consider
 
07:30:23.090 --> 07:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
amending this to to make that clear and
 
07:30:25.670 --> 07:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
to to protect the work of the housing
 
07:30:27.590 --> 07:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
appeals board thank you and I'm happy to
 
07:30:30.230 --> 07:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:32.208 --> 07:30:32.218 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
07:30:34.968 --> 07:30:34.978 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
07:30:38.090 --> 07:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
and we now call Chris Norwood
 
07:30:43.548 --> 07:30:43.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:46.548 --> 07:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:49.368 --> 07:30:49.378 align:start position:0%
and with that anybody else which wish to
 
07:30:52.310 --> 07:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
speak on House Bill 347 FN
 
07:31:05.090 --> 07:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:07.610 --> 07:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
you know just um
 
07:31:09.708 --> 07:31:09.718 align:start position:0%
just so just this is really just for the
 
07:31:09.718 --> 07:31:10.968 align:start position:0%
just so just this is really just for the
committee

07:31:10.968 --> 07:31:10.978 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:31:12.708 --> 07:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
um as you as you probably have seen
 
07:31:16.190 --> 07:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
we've scheduled hearings for two days uh
 
07:31:19.670 --> 07:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
next week uh Wednesday and Thursday I'm
 
07:31:22.128 --> 07:31:22.138 align:start position:0%
I'm the speaker had suggested that
 
07:31:24.410 --> 07:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
possibly next Thursday we could have a
 
07:31:25.968 --> 07:31:25.978 align:start position:0%
full house session if we do obviously
 
07:31:27.048 --> 07:31:27.058 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to cancel the
 
07:31:29.390 --> 07:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
hearings for Thursday but I it seemed
 
07:31:31.250 --> 07:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
like it was unlikely that it was going
 
07:31:33.048 --> 07:31:33.058 align:start position:0%
to happen so I'm that's why I scheduled
 
07:31:35.448 --> 07:31:35.458 align:start position:0%
for two days so we'll have hearings next
 
07:31:38.150 --> 07:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and Thursday and then my my my
 
07:31:41.628 --> 07:31:41.638 align:start position:0%
plan my inclination and I'm uh you know
 
07:31:43.670 --> 07:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm gonna talk further with
 
07:31:45.048 --> 07:31:45.058 align:start position:0%
representative Smith about this but my
 
07:31:48.110 --> 07:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
inclination is uh that the following
 
07:31:48.120 --> 07:31:49.610 align:start position:0%
inclination is uh that the following
week

07:31:49.610 --> 07:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
week
 
07:31:49.620 --> 07:31:50.270 align:start position:0%
week
um

07:31:50.270 --> 07:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:31:53.150 --> 07:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
we will have an executive session
 
07:31:55.850 --> 07:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
at least on Wednesday of that week which
 
07:31:57.650 --> 07:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
would be February 1st
 
07:31:57.660 --> 07:31:58.788 align:start position:0%
would be February 1st
the

07:31:58.788 --> 07:31:58.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:32:01.788 --> 07:32:01.798 align:start position:0%
right now the it seems
 
07:32:04.190 --> 07:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
pretty likely as of the day before
 
07:32:05.868 --> 07:32:05.878 align:start position:0%
yesterday that there would be a full
 
07:32:08.628 --> 07:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
house session on February 2nd but based
 
07:32:11.628 --> 07:32:11.638 align:start position:0%
on your comment it may be that there's
 
07:32:13.010 --> 07:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
not enough bills to make that worth
 
07:32:14.990 --> 07:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
ready that are ready for action that
 
07:32:17.330 --> 07:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
would make that worthwhile so if we
 
07:32:26.810 --> 07:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:28.730 --> 07:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
oh all right so that takes care of that
 
07:32:31.190 --> 07:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
so so so we'll have an executive session
 
07:32:33.230 --> 07:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
on February 1st
 
07:32:33.240 --> 07:32:33.968 align:start position:0%
on February 1st
um

07:32:33.968 --> 07:32:33.978 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:36.230 --> 07:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
07:32:38.090 --> 07:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
I guess I want to think about this a
 
07:32:39.230 --> 07:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
little bit but I'm thinking that maybe
 
07:32:41.030 --> 07:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
we will also have an executive session
 
07:32:43.730 --> 07:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
on February 3rd
 
07:32:45.708 --> 07:32:45.718 align:start position:0%
um but I I need to think about that and
 
07:32:47.208 --> 07:32:47.218 align:start position:0%
I also need to make sure we have a place
 
07:32:48.350 --> 07:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
to have it
 
07:32:50.868 --> 07:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
um so any you can count on February 1st
 
07:32:52.490 --> 07:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
and and
 
07:32:52.500 --> 07:32:53.448 align:start position:0%
and and
um

07:32:53.448 --> 07:32:53.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:56.150 --> 07:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know possibly February 3rd but I I
 
07:32:58.750 --> 07:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
need to uh get a little more information
 
07:33:01.610 --> 07:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
as to whether we have a place to have it
 
07:33:03.170 --> 07:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
and I also want to speak with
 
07:33:05.510 --> 07:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Smith about that all
 
07:33:05.520 --> 07:33:06.230 align:start position:0%
representative Smith about that all
right

07:33:06.230 --> 07:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:33:06.240 --> 07:33:13.150 align:start position:0%
right
um

07:33:13.150 --> 07:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:15.708 --> 07:33:15.718 align:start position:0%
about the third yeah
 
07:33:18.770 --> 07:33:18.780 align:start position:0%

07:33:21.350 --> 07:33:21.360 align:start position:0%

07:33:24.048 --> 07:33:24.058 align:start position:0%

07:33:25.968 --> 07:33:25.978 align:start position:0%
