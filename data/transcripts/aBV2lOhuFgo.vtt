00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 align:start position:0%
of the science technology and energy
 
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
committee and happy Earth Day to
 
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
everyone let's all rise and join
 
00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
representative Corman as he leads us in
 
00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
allegiance to the flag of the United

States of America and to the rep for
 
00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 align:start position:0%
which it stands one nation God
 
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
okay so this morning we have a couple of
 
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh things to do we're going to have a
 
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
work session full committee work session
 
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
on three
 
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
Bills starting right now those three
 
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
bills are Senate Bill 603 Senate Bill
 
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
386 and Senate Bill
 
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
449 and
 
00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 align:start position:0%
then at roughly 10:30 we're going to
 
00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
start an executive session on the those
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
same three bills there may be if we have
 
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
time a recess for caucus at around 10:00
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
or 10:15 if
 
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
necessary so let's get
 
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
started by taking a look at Senate Bill
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment was sent to everyone on
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
Friday so you should have all had the
 
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review it and consider
 
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
it this bill makes a few changes to the
 
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
bill none that are particularly
 
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
significant but all that all the changes
 
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
are important to someone so we'll go
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
through those the very first
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
change was requested by house leadership
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
it reduces the communication Services
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
tax from 7 to
 
00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
6.5% that's to cover any possible
 
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
increases in revenues that are raised by
 
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.670 align:start position:0%
increases in revenues that are raised by
this

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
legislation if you go to page
 
00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.350 align:start position:0%
legislation if you go to page
two

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
lines starting at line8 halfway through
 
00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
line eight it says the department May
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
specially assess
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
these providers for the costs of
 
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
Investigations and other proceedings
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
regarding telephone number conversation
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
which should be
 
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 align:start position:0%
conservation pursuant to RSA 365 colon
 
00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
37 comma 2 regardless of their
 
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
participation in any
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
proceeding that is language that appears
 
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
to extend the Department's ability to
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
and the way the language is
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
written after it was amended it
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
restricts that uh expansion just to this
 
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.830 align:start position:0%
restricts that uh expansion just to this
particular

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
proceeding so it is probably not going
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
to raise anybody's costs but house
 
00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879 align:start position:0%
leadership felt that it would be prudent
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
to reduce the communication services is
 
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 align:start position:0%
tax by a half a percent just in case to
 
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
cover any potential cost
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
increases and uh I believe those are the
 
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
made so I would like to hear if anybody
 
00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:18.749 align:start position:0%
made so I would like to hear if anybody
has

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
any comments questions about this
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
amendment representative McGee thank you
 
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um my reading of the um
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
testimony that we received in hearing
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
the only real opposition came from
 
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
ctia and they had a concern around uh
 
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
additional charges that this process
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
would incur that would be passed on to
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
their customers and I notice in the
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
section on page two starting at line8
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
that you read it says the department May
 
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
specially assess these providers for the
 
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
costs of Investigations and other
 
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
proceedings regarding telephone number
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
conservation it if we're going to change
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
that word to conservation uh pursuant to
 
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
RSA 365 colum 37 regardless of their
 
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
participation in any proceeding and I
 
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm concerned about is Will
 
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
these will this um smaller configuration
 
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.469 align:start position:0%
these will this um smaller configuration
of

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
organizations be included in any
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
proceeding or that or will they just get
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
the charges out of the proceeding
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
because I think that's um somewhat
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
somewhat where their concern was and
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat where my concern would be the
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
larger telephone operators don't seem to
 
00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:30.469 align:start position:0%
larger telephone operators don't seem to
be

00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
opposed um but the smaller folks that
 
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
are uh part of ctia do seem to have a
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
concern that it would the wording in
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
their letter is we are concerned that
 
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919 align:start position:0%
this bill would place an additional and
 
00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burden on the companies that
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
are already working in good faith with
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy to conserve
 
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.990 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy to conserve
numbering

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
numbering
 
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
resources um and they're saying that
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
there were previous attempts to delay
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
the exhaust of the area codes in 2000
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
and 2011
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh were successful without requiring an
 
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
assessment based on members of the
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
industry so that the that's the only
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
issue I think that we should discuss
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
well let's ask the department since they
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
are here if you guys could come up
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
please and give us
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
um some guidance on that language we'd
 
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.350 align:start position:0%
um some guidance on that language we'd
appreciate

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
it and good morning to you
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
all good morning Mr chairman members of
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
Chris Elms I'm the Deputy Commissioner
 
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
energy and I'm joined by Amanda Nunan
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
director of uh consumer services at the
 
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
department I'm going to let uh Amanda
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know answer this probably more
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
accurately than I will I'll just say
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
there are two separate issues there and
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
and and one of the ones that we I don't
 
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
have the amendment I'm sorry I haven't
 
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment but we had suggested
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
language uh to resolve the the the
 
00:09:58.269 --> 00:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
question about um those folks who have
 
00:09:59.949 --> 00:09:59.959 align:start position:0%
not chosen to participate in Thousand
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
block pooling and that was a separate
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
issue that than the assessment language
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
so um I'll let Amanda talk
 
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.430 align:start position:0%
so um I'll let Amanda talk
about

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
that sure thank you good morning um the
 
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
CTI is the cellular
 
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
telecommunications industry Association
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
I believe I have each letter right it's
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
roughly correct um and it consists of
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
large carriers such as T-Mobile Verizon
 
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
Wireless and small cellular carriers as
 
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
well so it's very big names within the
 
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.670 align:start position:0%
well so it's very big names within the
cellular

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
industry and the perhaps the the the the
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
small um adjective is better for the
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
testimony about the thousands block
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
pooling which came from the New

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
that so this this amendment um did
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
include just two other things that we
 
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
had suggested um representative Vose it
 
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.230 align:start position:0%
had suggested um representative Vose it
removed

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
removed
 
00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh language um and I'm looking the uh
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
Roman 2 on page
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
128 um down to line 29 where it says to
 
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
the maximum extent Allowed by federal
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
law for area code
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
603 the previous version uh of this bill
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
included a clause that said and any
 
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
subsequently assigned New Hampshire area
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
codes which has been stricken makes it
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
clear that this is just about the
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
603 uh and then going down a couple
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
lines I'm sorry I'm uh so line 30 and 31
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
ensuring that all service providers that
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
have chosen to participate in thousands
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
block pooling that H that that phrase
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
that have chosen to participate in
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
thousands block pooling that is a new
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
Clause that that um resolves I believe
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
the uh the the question raised by Mr
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
Rand uh in the public hearing New
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire telephone
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
Association go ahead representative
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr Ms for my answering my question
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
um and for being here today I I guess
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
then the question would be if you choose
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
not to participate are you still subject
 
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
to the assessment is everyone subject to
 
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
the assessment is that I'm going to to
 
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
Amanda on that based on the language
 
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.350 align:start position:0%
Amanda on that based on the language
here

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.750 align:start position:0%
here
sure

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
uh all providers are using telephone
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
numbers and so all providers using
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
telephone numbers would then pay towards
 
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
um this consultant contract which we'd
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
use the special assessment Provisions
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
for um to fund so yes that's the short
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
answer and the long answer okay I I will
 
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
just point out that um you know of you
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
know uh in in the 603 area code right
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
there are 10 million potential numbers
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
that could be used when you take out
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
ones that you you can't use uh ones that
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
have 911 in them things like that uh
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
there are about 7.8 Million numbers that
 
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
that potentially could be used in the
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
world um of of the ones that are
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
allocated out out in the world and and
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't have the the best math
 
00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
here but if you uh if you take the cost
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
of this consultant contract at the high
 
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
end $300,000 and you divide it by the 7
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
million or so numbers that are allocated
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
out in the world uh it looks like
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
something like a penny and a half per
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
line per year of control just so you can
 
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
have a sense of the um the costs we're
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
here additional questions representative
 
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
Ms thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question I have I have I have
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
a series of questions if you don't if
 
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
the chair would just indulge me all
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
related to one thing okay go ahead um so
 
00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
my my assumption is that the assessment
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about would be to pay
 
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
for the consultant is that correct yeah
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
so the assessment in this case and I'll
 
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
let Amanda um fill in what I what I
 
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
don't uh answer well uh that is the cost
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
of the consultant to help us in the
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
proceeding that we would open um or that
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
we have opened here so uh you know we
 
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
call it an investigation but that is you
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
know it's a little more in- depth than
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
just looking into it you know we we are
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
going to undertake actions through that
 
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
investigation that allow us to move
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
forward um it's it's you know we we've
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
brought up the examples of other states
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
um it's it's one of those things where
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
you know it's difficult but it's not
 
00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:46.519 align:start position:0%
hard type of type of conversations right
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
in the same way that if you want to go
 
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
on a hike of a presidential Traverse
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
right it's simple to know what you need
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
to do you know the mountains you see the
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
trail maps you can read about all the
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
things that you might want to do but at
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
the same time you have to get in shape
 
00:14:58.749 --> 00:14:58.759 align:start position:0%
you have to buy all the equipment that
 
00:15:00.189 --> 00:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
you want want to do and you know go
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
through it so we know broadly the
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
direction we need to go here we know a
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
lot of the steps that we can take but we
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
also have to undertake what's a pretty
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
Technical and and uh collaborative
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
process and and the the fiscal note
 
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
indicated that the cost of that
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
consultant could be between hundred and
 
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.710 align:start position:0%
consultant could be between hundred and
two

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
$300,000 that's what we're talking about
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
over over three years and and divided
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
amongst all the okay and then what I
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
understood was that the reduction in the
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
communications tax was so to compensate
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
for the extra the extra cost of the
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
assessment how much how much do we
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
collect in Communications tax so on the
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
Communication Service tax I I will have
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
to defer that to other other folks that
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
you know um that is a a general fund tax
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
we don't get any revenue from the
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
Communication Service tax at the
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
department of energy um I don't know
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
what what that equals on your average
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
bill but it's a 7%
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
tax on on on those Communications so I
 
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
can't give you the number um Dr might be
 
00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
able to yeah and I guess I guess and
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
this is the the the where I was really
 
00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:13.959 align:start position:0%
going with the question is is the the
 
00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:16.189 align:start position:0%
going with the question is is the the
0.5%

00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
0.5%
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
reduction um is
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
that does that result in a
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
reduction is is that is is that
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
reduction in revenues equivalent to
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
what's going to be spent for the for the
 
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
for the consultant
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
so and and that 0.5 reduction is ongoing
 
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959 align:start position:0%
it's not just for three years so I'm
 
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
trying to do the
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
math you would have to have somebody
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
else help you with the math there I
 
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.749 align:start position:0%
else help you with the math there I
would

00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
say that I would imagine it is a a a
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
greater reduction through the
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax than it would
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
be uh any any costs associated with the
 
00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
assessment that which you know we we
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
would be clear are are not necessarily
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
tied together the Communication Service
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
tax does not benefit the department uh
 
00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
you know from a revenue perspective
 
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
that's a it's a general fund uh tax
 
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:12.839 align:start position:0%
whereas the assessment is is housed
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
within the department so so the redu a
 
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
reduction in the in the communication
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
tax is going to impact programs across
 
00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
the board uh across All State agencies I
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
mean it could end up having an impact on
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
what we're able to spend
 
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
for I don't know
 
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
um you know Assist assistance to
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
low-income people I
 
00:17:36.909 --> 00:17:36.919 align:start position:0%
mean you know I I don't want to comment
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
on that as it's it's sort of out of my
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
Lane that was more of a rhetorical
 
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you I didn't want to put
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
you in the spot there further questions
 
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.510 align:start position:0%
you in the spot there further questions
representative

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
Summers thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question mine is actually
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
when I read this bill and and also the
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
amendment I was concerned about and I I
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
think I understand it but I wanted to
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
ask if this bill and Amendment include
 
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
Does it include any goal especially with
 
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
the pooling any goal towards detering or
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
blocking spam or auto dialer businesses
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
numbers um that's certainly one thing
 
00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
that we anticipate looking at is the use
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
of numbers um outside of the State of
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not necessarily by people
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
that got a cell phone when they lived
 
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
here and moved but for use for
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
commercial Purp pures outside of the
 
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire at the federal
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
level there's been um a a lot of work
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
over the past 4 to five years to
 
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
implement a number of measures uh
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
certainly there's more that can be done
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
in looking at cyber crime and the use of
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
these numbers is is something that we
 
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
investigation resentative n has a
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
question well I did but I figured it out
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
you representative the wiki uh thank you
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um and I this may or may not
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to this bill um however
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
coming from my background I say why can
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
we not just do something simple take all
 
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
of the telephone 603 numbers that are in
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
Ed do a diff between that and all of the
 
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
possible numbers and out will fall
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
another file which is all of the unused
 
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039 align:start position:0%
numbers and we can assign those rather
 
00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
than depending upon some fossilized
 
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
agency like nanpa to do it we just tell
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
them okay we've got all these recycled
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
numbers let's use them uh I'll let the
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
department comment on that if they
 
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.310 align:start position:0%
department comment on that if they
choose

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
to so the the North American numbering
 
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
plan administrator is the administrator
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
of numbers ac across the country and
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
they have all that information states
 
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
have limited insight into uh resources
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
and numbers but certainly not to the
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
extent that you described and that would
 
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
have to be something that was done at a
 
00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.789 align:start position:0%
have to be something that was done at a
federal

00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
level representative bernardy has a
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair so uh I
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
received a uh a comment from
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
representative alvinc who is here right
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
now and he suggested in part of the
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
assessment that the uh um numbers that
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
are used for security alarm systems
 
00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:30.919 align:start position:0%
Pages for volunteer EMS uh and fire
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
folks that are Auto dialed from a
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
dispatcher um self-based cameras that
 
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
can use up to six numbers at a time
 
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
simultaneously none of those uh are
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
numbers that are would be used in
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
preserving the 603 Mystique for for
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
residents they they outgoing calls and
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
and uh Auto automated often times and
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
there are others potentially in that
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
same boat um can your uh
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
assessment be directed to look at those
 
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
and potentially reassign those folks
 
00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.710 align:start position:0%
and potentially reassign those folks
other

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
numbers so that's certainly something
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
that um we could look at as part of this
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
um engagement with a consultant I would
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
note that on a national level there's an
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
effort it's called iot or Internet of
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
things which isn't a very explanatory um
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
term but it it looks at exactly what
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
you're describing and all the
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
non telephone uses of telephone numbers
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
and that's a very massive undertaking at
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
the federal level because it's not
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
unique to New Hampshire it's across the
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative Ms has another question
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you this is actually just one
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
question this time um the um the the
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
bill um as introduced and and I don't
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
think the amendment changes it repeals
 
00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
the language and existing statute that
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
talks about the the the the procedure or
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
the guidelines that should be used if a
 
00:22:21.789 --> 00:22:21.799 align:start position:0%
new area code is
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
needed um that's section six in the uh
 
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
in the in the RSA um I mean given what
 
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
what I think we heard which is even if
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
we implement this uh even if we
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
implement this language and are able to
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
um you know preserve the the uniqueness
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the 603 that's only going to be for a
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
while I mean eventually we're going to
 
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
need a new area
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
code um I I guess I'm it just doesn't
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
seem prudent to me to eliminate language
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
that would guide us when we actually
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
have to assign A New U area code
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
sure uh that language was um stricken to
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
reflect just change circumstances since
 
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
that language was originally put into
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
statute so when the National Suicide
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
Prevention Hotline was um rolled out and
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
I I forget the three-digit number that
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
folks dial for that um it pushed New
 
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to go to 10 digigit dialing
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
and once you've made the move to 10
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
digigit dialing the two options for
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
implementing a new area code are reduced
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
to one which is an overlay where you
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
simply there's a new area code and it
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
lays over the whole state versus a
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
geographic split where people squabble
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
over who gets 603 and who gets the new
 
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.710 align:start position:0%
over who gets 603 and who gets the new
area

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
code representative
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
McGee um my question was back on the
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
assessment and penalties so we're back
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
up in section three on page two and um I
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
think you know we've sort of established
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal note is related to the
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
role of a consultant coming in to try
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
and devise a plan for us to move forward
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
on figuring out how to conserve and
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
preserve numbers and elongate our
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
ability to have 603 as our our uni uh
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
area code but it also says here uh
 
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0%
starting on line a the department May
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
spe specially assess these providers for
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
the costs of Investigations which I'm
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
assuming is the consultant fees and
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
other uh proceedings regarding telephone
 
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
number conversions pursuant to RSA
 
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
3652 regardless of their participation
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
in any proceedings which I read before
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to say service
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
providers shall be subject to penalties
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
imposed by the department or commission
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
for failure to pay a special assessment
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
or for failure to comply with any rule
 
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
or order so out of this uh assessment
 
00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
proceeding do you anticipate that there
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
will be specific rules or orders that
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
folks will do do you have any idea what
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
kind of rules or orders may end up
 
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
creating assessments for the
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
companies because I'm assuming the
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
language is in here for a reason I don't
 
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
have a specific example to point to but
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
ju as a general example if there were a
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
directive that um carriers participate
 
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
in in um voluntary exchange of
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
blocks that are more than 10%
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
contaminated which is the Benchmark for
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
returning a block to the pool at Nampa
 
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
but um less than 15% contaminated that
 
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
they voluntarily agree to transfer those
 
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
blocks among one another rather than
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
getting a new block out of the pool that
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
okay further
 
00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
questions or comments about this bill
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
chairman yes I have a comment um every
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
now and then I agree with something that
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has said and
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh he said something last week that I do
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
agree with where he and and uh
 
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington please uh
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm uh mischaracterizing
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
what you said uh but you were wondering
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
um we're going to run out of numbers
 
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.789 align:start position:0%
um we're going to run out of numbers
eventually

00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:30.669 align:start position:0%
eventually
ually

00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
ually
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
and why go through this exercise when
 
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to run out of numbers it's
 
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
just going to happen and all we're doing
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
is delaying the inevitable and that's my
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
concern with the bill I I will vote for
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment because I think the
 
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
amendment makes the bill better but I I
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
really think the bill is unnecessary as
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
we are going to run out of numbers no
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
do representative Harrington would like
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
to respond yeah I agree that's what I
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
said and I do agree we're going to run
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
out of number eventually and of course
 
00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:00.919 align:start position:0%
that means since we agree the Patriots
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
are going to have a great draft um but
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh I in talking with the people on this
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
I think the attempt here is to delay
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
running out until we go to the what is
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
it 15 digits or something like that so
 
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
this may extend it out to that part when
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to make a major change
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
anyways and the hope is that it will
 
00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
this will last long enough so we don't
 
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
have to make two
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
changes I think that's correct isn't it
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
I if if I may just give that certainly
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
that question there um you know like
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
like I said before we we have been able
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
to look at and see what other states
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
have been able to do Maine was in a even
 
00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
more dire situation than the one we're
 
00:27:41.509 --> 00:27:41.519 align:start position:0%
in now back in 2021 where they were
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
projected to exhaust in 2024 now um
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
after undertaking a lot of their efforts
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
I think their projected exhaustion is in
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
the early 2030s um so they've already
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
seen some success and I think they they
 
00:27:53.509 --> 00:27:53.519 align:start position:0%
think they're going to be able to extend
 
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
it out even further our hope would be
 
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
would be that we would be able to extend
 
00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
the life of this the 603 so that that
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
that that question about 15 digigit
 
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
dialing is what gets rid of the area
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
exhaustion okay thank you uh
 
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.029 align:start position:0%
exhaustion okay thank you uh
representative

00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
Ms um I I I was going to initially agree
 
00:28:22.269 --> 00:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
with representative Corman but then
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
having heard representative Harrington
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
hell has frozen over because I agree
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
with him as well um that you know we
 
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
might as well we might as well try to um
 
00:28:35.549 --> 00:28:35.559 align:start position:0%
to um you know save the the area code as
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
as long as possible the one thing that I
 
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:39.559 align:start position:0%
have a problem with and I think this is
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
where I differ with representative
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
Corman is I will not vote for the
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
amendment because I do not believe that
 
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
we should be reducing the communication
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
Services tax um I don't think it's
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
related to this uh this
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
initiative um but um I will I I I will
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
vote for the the amendment if that I the
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
passed okay any further comments
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
um in listening to this discussion and I
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
got here a little late and I apologize
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
um it feels like the opposition to
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
changing 603 is similar to the
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
opposition of changing the exit numbers
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
on the highways and um in some ways
 
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
isn't it just time that we we accept the
 
00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:35.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
vintage well obviously um and thank you
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
for the question it's it's a good one
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
it's it is the legislative prerogative
 
00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
to determine sort of what that
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
prioritization is um we have seen you
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
know and and I know the Department of
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs is
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
undertaking a study on this but there
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
are economic uh benefits you know I I
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
think the 603 is undeniably
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know something associated with New
 
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in in an iconic way and the um
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
it it really is up to the legislature to
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
say is this something that my
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
constituents would care about you know
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
from what we've heard we we would think
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
that it it it might be certainly um but
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
that's obviously up to you as a as a
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
determine okay seeing no further comment
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
I think we have discussed senator Bill
 
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
603 to the degree that we need to I
 
00:30:33.389 --> 00:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
think we have a pretty good idea of
 
00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:36.039 align:start position:0%
where we're headed with that bill so now
 
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
let's discuss Senate Bill
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
386 and I am passing out an amendment to
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
moment and I will Begin by reminding the
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
members that when we heard the testimony
 
00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
by Senator avard on this bill
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
he said to
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
us please give me a study
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
committee he wants a study
 
00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:10.110 align:start position:0%
committee he wants a study
committee

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
he was less sure about what the subject
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
of the study committee should
 
00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
so I have prepared the amendment 1558 h
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
to create a study
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
committee to study the creation of a
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
pamphlet or website for incoming
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720 align:start position:0%

Efficiency the makeup of the committee
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
will be the same as in the original bill
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
but the duties of the committee will be
 
00:31:56.559 --> 00:31:58.389 align:start position:0%
but the duties of the committee will be
different

00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
the committee will study the creation of
 
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
a pamphlet or online site for incoming
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire energy landscape so that's
 
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
what the the new bill will do or the new
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
study committee will do and I'm
 
00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
interested to hear comments from the
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman um it
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like a lot of fun to do this um
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
but I'm wondering uh this looks like a
 
00:33:27.149 --> 00:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
non- gerain amendment to me and I'm
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
wondering about about
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
that I don't think it is because it it
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
follows the same form it just changes
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
the content of what the study committee
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
will do I can check with the clerk but I
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
I think it will be appr appropriate and
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
approved representative
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
Kennedy thank you Mr chairman uh you
 
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
know we just finished discussing a bill
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
for the Department of energy that as far
 
00:33:57.389 --> 00:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
as I can tell has nothing to do with
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
energy whatsoever so I I have no idea
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
why the department of energy is doing
 
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
that but this this particular bill I
 
00:34:06.909 --> 00:34:06.919 align:start position:0%
mean it's the same question I had for
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
the senator was why can't the department
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
of energy prepare a report this seems
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
like something the department of energy
 
00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
you know could
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
do well this is a study committee and
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
the study committee's recommendation may
 
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
be for the Department of energy to
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
produce this pamphlet or online site
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
based on recommendations that they come
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
up with that would be one of the options
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
that the the uh study committee could
 
00:34:35.839 --> 00:34:36.829 align:start position:0%
that the the uh study committee could
could

00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
recommend who else had their heading up
 
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.909 align:start position:0%
recommend who else had their heading up
representative

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
nter I was a freshman legislator with
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
Senator Kevin avard he was a State Rep
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
first back in 2010 and he's our singing
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
Senator and so I have a lot of respect
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
for him and normally I just
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
automatically give a thumbs down to a
 
00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
study because we have so many but if
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
it'll make make him happy and it makes
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
it's energy made easy and it will they
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
Define all these word all these letters
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
for new legislators like pu D OE d s RPS
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
Reggie and goes on and on and I remember
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
being new to this committee and I had no
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
idea what anybody was talking about
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
until one day pu I'm like oh I know that
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
one so I think it's a good
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
idea representative Harrington yeah I
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
think um certainly uh I agree with the
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
previous speaker that there's a lot of
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
Confusion And there's a lot of uh um
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
presumed knowledge that's not accurate
 
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
shall we say by a lot of people and so
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
this kind of covers most everything but
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
as as I said in the comment I sent out
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
over the weekend I really think we need
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
to get a little more specific that we
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
need to address ISO no England and the
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
role they play because that is clearly
 
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
misunderstood some people think they're
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
an agency of the federal government some
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
people think they're uh some agency of
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or something I I mean I've
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
heard all sorts of different things why
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
don't we just get out of there we don't
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
need need them uh so what how they're
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
involved in the process and the fact
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
that they are a utility that's regulated
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
by FK um a lot of people don't even know
 
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
that basic fact so I just think putting
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
something specific in there about ISO
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
New England would be would be helpful
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
just so it's not
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
overlooked you think the lines 25 and 26
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
would be adequate to that
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
purpose I mean if you you if you want to
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at that and you expand on it
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
drastically you would obviously get into
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
ISO New England but it's such an
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
important concept I think calling it out
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
in the bill uh is would be helpful
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
because I mean it is a big player and a
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
lot of people have no idea what the
 
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
interaction is who they regulated by and
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
so yes okay further comments
 
00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.589 align:start position:0%
so yes okay further comments
representative

00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
parshall thank you chair I generally
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
agree with the comments of of the last
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
two speakers um I think where I'm might
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
want to take exception is spending tax
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
payer dollars taxpayer dollars pardon me
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
to uh keep Senators happy I don't think
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
it's our function to that's uh you know
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
I I just I just find that not within
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
something which I would want to get
 
00:37:14.829 --> 00:37:14.839 align:start position:0%
behind but I do agree that a good
 
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
glossery would help go a long ways in
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
helping dispel a lot of things I would
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
also agree that ISO is an important part
 
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
of this I think there's a number part
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
number of important parts that I hope
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
would come out in the study um I just
 
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:28.599 align:start position:0%
don't know if this uh if we're dealing
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
with when it comes to policy too much of
 
00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:33.079 align:start position:0%
a shifting slope to really create
 
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
anything of any lasting
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
permanence representative Thomas thank
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um along the lines of the
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
previous speaker um this kind of feels
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
like Reinventing the wheel there's lots
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
of good documents already that are out
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
there you can look on Amazon there's
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
lots of good books about energy energy
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
is literally in flux and it changes on
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
an almost daily basis this report and
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
really what it is is just a research
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
paper uh is outdated probably the day
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
published thank you representative
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman uh I
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
actually think it would be a really nice
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
primer for new members of the committee
 
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
I I think I would have appreciated
 
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
having a document like this when I came
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
on at the beginning of last year but I
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
also want to say that um the the uh
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
thought expressed by representative
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
Harrington about ISO New England
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
unbelievable but I had the very same
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
thought um I saw the part about the
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
regional grid but I thought ISO New
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
England is a lot bigger than that for
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
example it runs the energy auctions and
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that needs to be in there so
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
um uh twice in one day I'm agreeing with
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington uh take that
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
for what you will representative liwi uh
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um we've got this st&amp; jargon
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
jogger which is really a brief version
 
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
say that again please um we had this
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
document passed out stn jargon uh jargon
 
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
jogger um which I've got right here in
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
front of me which is a brief version of
 
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're talking about it's
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
got uh basically expands the acronyms
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
and just going a little beyond that
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
would be probably enough for a lot of
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
people okay further
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
mutts thank you
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe a a study committee
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
is is necessary I mean I I think any
 
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
everything that's that's um identified
 
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
in this in this amendment could easily
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
be uh provided by either the department
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
of energy the Department of
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services in in a in a in a
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
in a report you know every two years
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
that is given to you know all new and
 
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
and um well all all Representatives so a
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
St I don't believe a study committee is
 
00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
going to add any
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
value representative McGee thank you Mr
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think we had a little bit
 
00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
of an offline on this and um I know I
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
sent points along in terms of the
 
00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839 align:start position:0%
composite of how New Hampshire energy
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
the sector works I think it is helpful
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
for people coming on to the committee to
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
have some context around um you know how
 
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
the how deregulation works works you
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
know the stuff that is sort of in
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
between the lines that you don't get
 
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
until you've been on the committee for a
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
long time is really helpful but um how
 
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
you get that information is another
 
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
question I since I've been on the
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
committee I know that the the jargon
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
jogger or the you know acronym list
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
which I worked on a little bit with doe
 
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
they were putting one together we were
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
putting one together we and we you know
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
added them together to to get something
 
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
to folks we've been providing that on in
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
our caucus and we've been also providing
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
individual training for new people
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
coming online and it's ad hoc it's
 
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
people who are experts in different
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
areas like net metering or whatever
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
because when people come in they know
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
the term and that's really all they know
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
um but it is very ad hoc and so I think
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
there's also a significant amount of
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
information that the department of
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
energy provides to us so they do an RPS
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
report they have a 10-year strategy
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
report there are a lot of things
 
00:41:27.309 --> 00:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
available on their website already that
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
people could familiarize themselves with
 
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to spend the time to read
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
all of those things and I think that's
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
the problem is that people don't read as
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
much as they used to and they and they
 
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
may not want to put the time into all of
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
that voluminous information so I I I'm
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
torn on this I I I think not a lot will
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
get done between uh when this passes and
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
November 1st so I'm not sure a fome
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
report can really be done which I
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
brought up in the hearing it's a short
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
amount of time it's an election year I
 
00:41:59.550 --> 00:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
don't know what the participation will
 
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
be like and I don't know how well it
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
will will be led so I I am also uh torn
 
00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
as to whether this should just be
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
something that goes to the Department of
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
energy to provide um an O an overview
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
space of New Hampshire energy I I think
 
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
sense well the study committee could
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
recommend that representative
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I I tend to agree with
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
the previous speakers that I think the
 
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
department of is capable of doing this
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
without and probably would do a better
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
job at it because let's face it they're
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
here fulltime during the summer we tend
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
to be of any place but the state house
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
so uh I think you probably get in a
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
better uh uh effort that way and also if
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
you do um have a study committee just to
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
say we recommend the department of
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
energy do this I mean is that just sort
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
of a waste of paper but on the on the
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
final thought regardless of how it's
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
done uh as one of the previous speakers
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned I don't think this should be a
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
policy documented at all it shouldn't be
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
trying to say we should do this or do
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
that or not do this it should just be a
 
00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:05.559 align:start position:0%
statement of facts saying you know this
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
is the function of iso New England this
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
is how net metering Works uh this is
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
what the forward capacity Market auction
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
is and not not make a statement on
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's good bad or indifferent
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
which is just to be an educational tool
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
but I I still think the department of
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
energy could probably put out a better
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
product further
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
comment representative Kaplan thank you
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair is it possible to ask the
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
department of energy how this would fit
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
into any kind of communications outreach
 
00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
program that they already have I me
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
because I I can see this as a as a
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
wonderful educational tool for the
 
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
general public not necessarily for the
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
state reps but maybe something they
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
already have or maybe they have a
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
thought on whether that would be useful
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
or not would anybody from the Department
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Chris Al from the
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
Department of energy um
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
I think as been as has been mentioned a
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
number of the requirements here are
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
currently available on our website um
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
you know this bill just the position we
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
would take is we'd be happy to
 
00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:10.839 align:start position:0%
participate in any study committee that
 
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
would look at whether or not there
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
should be a collected aggregated report
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
that we would include I think there are
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
a number of resources that we have again
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
on our website on uh you know uh the
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
utilities websites on the pu's websites
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
um in our our state energy strategy
 
00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
uh if if folks want to aggregate that
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
together we'd be happy to discuss what
 
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
like thank
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
you further comments representative
 
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
McGee the last thing I'll say is if if
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
our goal is just to keep Senator avard
 
00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
happy he did say we could make it just
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
storage and he would be
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
happy so if we don't want to make it
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
into you know a huge
 
00:44:58.549 --> 00:44:58.559 align:start position:0%
exercise I person Al don't want to do
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
another amendment but representative uh
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
Harrington just one other thing that uh
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
just again no matter how it's done
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's a study committee or or we
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
just task the department to do it and
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that always comes up I
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
probably get more phone calls and emails
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
on this than any other subject to do
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
with energy is what's a competitive
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
supplier how do you get one will then is
 
00:45:25.549 --> 00:45:25.559 align:start position:0%
that mean if my wires go down that those
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
mean people from uh ever Source won't
 
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
put them back up because I don't buy
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
their my electricity from them and they
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
all know it so I mean I think that's
 
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
something that really needs to be
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
included because I I think the average
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
state repc gets asked that question and
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
they don't know where to go to find a
 
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier for one of their
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
constituents and they don't realize that
 
00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
the utility still owns all the wires and
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
there's no change to it and the person
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
restringing the wires has no idea
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
whether you're buying the electricity
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
from ever Source or a competitive
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
supplier or whatever so I just think
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
it's something should be could be and
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
now we have a nonprofit so we should be

01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
you okay Senate Bill
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
449 relative to the permit issuance
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
timeline for State air per and the
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
duty to make annual reports it's
 
01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.430 align:start position:0%
duty to make annual reports it's
Amendment

01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
15658 and this is an amendment that I'm
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
told was agreed to by the department and
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
the business and industry
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
Association is I'm seeing nods from
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
members of the department and the Bia so
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that I'm correct about that
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
that this is a mutually agreed
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment and what the amendment
 
01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
does primarily is it adds new language
 
01:13:06.669 --> 01:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
starting at line 24 through line 32
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
reporting and I've forgotten if it does
 
01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.310 align:start position:0%
reporting and I've forgotten if it does
anything

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
else um could the department clarify
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
me Craig Wright uh Dees uh the
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
department does support the amendment
 
01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
what it changes is the timeline for
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
permanent issuance on line 12 previously
 
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
it said 180 days now it says 120 days
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
and we are okay with that change uh and
 
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
also changes on line 15 the reference
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
there 40 CFR
 
01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.310 align:start position:0%
there 40 CFR
70.4

01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
70.4
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
B6 it changed that six to a six from a
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
four so it clarified that Federal
 
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
reference and then it adds the annual
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement at the end of the
 
01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.390 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement at the end of the
bill

01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.120 align:start position:0%

01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
so thank you for being here to help
 
01:14:19.229 --> 01:14:19.239 align:start position:0%

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
we ended the hearings was that the we
 
01:14:43.629 --> 01:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
wanted the parties to be agreed upon
 
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
what change was needed and it looks like
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%

01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
know if you had any questions um yes so
 
01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
this change um does alleviate our
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
concerns we feel that the 120 days is
 
01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
much more workable especially for small
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
business um the other change on line 15
 
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
is just a technical correction so no
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
issues there and then um the new
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
reporting section um just provide some
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
more transparency it's my understanding
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
that um Dees already kind of collects
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
this data so just if we could review it
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the timelines are
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
operating on a timely manner which I I
 
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
believe at this time that they are but
 
01:15:38.629 --> 01:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
it just allows that transparency for the
 
01:15:38.639 --> 01:15:40.030 align:start position:0%
it just allows that transparency for the
business

01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
Community great thank you representative
 
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you and thank you for
 
01:15:47.629 --> 01:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question so uh when we had the
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
hearing last week there was discussion
 
01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
about maybe two tracks one for smaller
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
businesses one for larger businesses you
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
feel that 120 days one siiz fits-all is
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question um we do
 
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
believe this is the best solution going
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
forward um Dees experts I believe looked
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
at trying to create du uh dual tracks as
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
well as experts in our membership it was
 
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
incredibly complex difficult to do and
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
hard to find a reasonable place to draw
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
the line um simply because you know for
 
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
example like the title five permits that
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't touch the timeline of um need
 
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
that more time and we recognized that so
 
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
we felt that this was the most
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to move forward
 
01:16:25.199 --> 01:16:26.950 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to move forward
representative

01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
Kennedy uh thank you Mr chairman thanks
 
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I I the the
 
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that uh uh requires a
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
report going to the two committees I
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
mean do do you think that's going to be
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
an adequate uh mechanism if you have
 
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:45.320 align:start position:0%
some complaints about how this is
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
working thank you for the question um we
 
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
think that that's an opportunity to
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
review that data and if there's a need
 
01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
for change in legislation that um
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
potentially bringing it to the attention
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
of um the two committees who this would
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
be in the purview of um would be a
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable path moving forward if there
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.669 --> 01:17:08.679 align:start position:0%
necessary uh representative Harrington
 
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
taking my questions more of a comment I
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
guess my major concern with the bill was
 
01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
the lack of that reporting uh in the
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
original one the way it's was written
 
01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
you have a certain amount of time to get
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
the permit unless the applicant says
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
we'll give you extra time so if the
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
agency says well we can't do it unless
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
you give us extra time it sort of forces
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
them into a situation where they can't
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
win because the agency could simply say
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
well then you don't get your permit
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
unless you give us extra time but having
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
the reporting there so that the
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
legislature could look at it and say you
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
know 90% of the permits are running over
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
120 days what's going on or hopefully
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
it's going to be 2% of the permits were
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
going over 120 days and they were all
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
because the applicant needed more time
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
for something so I think adding that in
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
is a big uh big plus to the Bill thank
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
you representative and actually that was
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
one of our concerns as well and in our
 
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
discussions with Dees they um assured us
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
that permits cannot be denied based on
 
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
timeline issues and that was one of our
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
concerns it just based on the statutes
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
it can't happen so I think that
 
01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.070 align:start position:0%
it can't happen so I think that
complements

01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
complements
 
01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
that any further questions for Miss K
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you Mr chair
 
01:18:20.669 --> 01:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
in your in your testimony on this bill
 
01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
um I I I give you a lot of credit for
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
identifying what I think is one of the
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
um fundamental reasons why the
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
department has challenges in terms of um
 
01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
fulfilling its requirements under the
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
stat under statute and that's a lack of
 
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
Le resources um are you convinced that
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
they have the resources to meet the
 
01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.669 align:start position:0%
they have the resources to meet the
120-day

01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
120-day
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
requirement um thank you for the
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
question I don't want to speak for the
 
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
Department especially when they're here
 
01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
behind me but this wasn't a a an
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that we came to an agreement
 
01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.990 align:start position:0%
amendment that we came to an agreement
on

01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
together follow up yeah and I I just
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify I should have said
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
this before I am in no way suggesting
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
that the the department that you know is
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
um is not trying to do the very best job
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
they can with the resources that they
 
01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
have uh I'm very aware of the fact that
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
Dees as well as other state agencies
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
have been operating for years with out
 
01:19:24.189 --> 01:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
the resources that they need so I just
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
KO seeing none I want to thank you thank
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%

comments about this amendment to Senate
Bill

449 okay seeing
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
none any further comments about the
 
01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
other two bills Senate Bill 603 or
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
minutes representative Ms than thank you
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair on um on 603 um as I as I
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier I um I I will not be
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
able to vote for the amendment as it's
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you you're proposing
 
01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
um primarily and only because of the um
 
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
the the inclusion of a reduction in the
 
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax um but I do
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
recognize that there are some other
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
important elements in the amendment that
 
01:20:43.229 --> 01:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
you um that you have given us um and I
 
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
am in the process of trying to get a
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
separate amendment that hopefully we can
 
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
consider if your if your Amendment fails
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
that includes the language um that um I
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
think the um the rural uh providers were
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
looking for and also the the um the the
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
cell companies so um I just wanted to
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
give everyone a heads up to
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative McGee yeah
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
if I might just mention and when we went
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
and and talked um the concern was really
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
that the revenue uh from this tax goes
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
into the general fund and there are
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
going to be there's going to be some
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
lowering of revenu and you know
 
01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
difficulties coming into finances in the
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
next year so the quantifying of how much
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
money this will affect and um what
 
01:21:37.629 --> 01:21:37.639 align:start position:0%
effect it will have uh on the general
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
fund was an open question the other
 
01:21:42.669 --> 01:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
question was should a bill that has a
 
01:21:45.149 --> 01:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on it like this um have to
 
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
go to a second committee for a
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
discussion or understanding of that
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact so that's kind of the
 
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
conversation that we had around whether
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
or not we should should just be you know
 
01:21:58.590 --> 01:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
making a cut of half a point to that tax
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
without having you know considered the
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
impacts uh on our ability to do other
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
things with that funding and um so I
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
guess since there is a pending um
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
additional Amendment for that bill I'd
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
ask that we maybe move it to the to the
 
01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:19.719 align:start position:0%
third spot in order to give us time to
 
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
get that Amendment if if the uh
 
01:22:25.629 --> 01:22:25.639 align:start position:0%

01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%

01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:37.840 align:start position:0%

repeatedly tells us that you can start
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
an executive session after the noticed
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
time but you can't start it before the
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
noticed time so we still have seven
 
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:16.280 align:start position:0%

01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
okay it is now 10:30 and so we can
 
01:29:59.950 --> 01:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
officially start an exact session we
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
have three bills to dispose of excuse me
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
in the next
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh period of time however long it takes
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
Center Bill 603 relative to telephone
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
number and area code
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
conservation it's c a bill 386 relative
 
01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
to establishing a committee to study
 
01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
something and Senate Bill 449 relative
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
to the permit issue in timeline for
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
State air
 
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
permits so I'm going to open an exec
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
session first on Senate Bill
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
449 since that was the last one we
 
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
looked at right before
 
01:30:41.709 --> 01:30:41.719 align:start position:0%
we finished our work session I think it
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate that it be the first
 
01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
one that we take up and so I will move
 
01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.719 --> 01:30:52.550 align:start position:0%

believe that we're addressing the

underlying reasons why it has been so
 
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to get uh permits approved

representative mun's point if we had if
 
01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:35.719 align:start position:0%

scratching but I will get you something

that's okay H scratching works it will
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
not be on consent since it will have a
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
Minority Report and with that we'll
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%

uh better um however I can't vote for it

that's better left to the Department of

of what the changes to the bill are and
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
why they might be
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
desirable but I'd open the floor to
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
further comments on Senate Bill 603 and
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%

the the changes that were made to
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
section two of the original bill I
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
believe make the the bill a better bill
 
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
that addresses many of the concerns that
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
were raised during testimony
 
01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with the amendment um and
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
the um the introduction of a reduction
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
in the um Interstate communication
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
Services tax which never came up during

the bill um untenable for me so
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
