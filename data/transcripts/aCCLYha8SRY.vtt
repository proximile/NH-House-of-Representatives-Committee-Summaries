00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
i don't see his name on the list
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman
 
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.160 align:start position:0%

um thank you very much um
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
pleased to be here today supporting
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 78 a number of renewable
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
energy advocates asked me to introduce
 
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.869 align:start position:0%
energy advocates asked me to introduce
it

00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
as did um
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
the chair of the puc
 
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.389 align:start position:0%
the chair of the puc
the

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
it changes the
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
monies in the renewable energy fund to
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
be continually appropriated
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
as opposed to allowing
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
those dollars to lapse
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
what has happened
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund is funded from
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
as you know alternative compliance
 
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
as you know alternative compliance
payments

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.150 align:start position:0%
payments
um

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
moving from
 
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.430 align:start position:0%
moving from
the

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh continually appropriated to
 
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.350 align:start position:0%
uh continually appropriated to
non-lapsing

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
what it has done is caused long delays
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
issuance of renewable energy fund
 
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.430 align:start position:0%
issuance of renewable energy fund
budgets

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
which has created uncertainty
 
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.310 align:start position:0%
which has created uncertainty
and

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
significant disruption
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
and suspension of the programs while a
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
balance of the fund goes
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
unused so
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill is to smooth out
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh the funding so that there's certainty
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh for these projects moving forward uh
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
passed i believe on the consent calendar
 
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.470 align:start position:0%
passed i believe on the consent calendar
in

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.269 align:start position:0%
in
the

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
senate and i commend it to you thank you
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you senator bradley
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
we have any questions for senator
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
bradley representative thomas
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
um could you explain a little more
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
center on
 
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.870 align:start position:0%
center on
um

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
what this change does bill uh
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
you said it was not
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
i i believe that the wording you still
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
have there is a non-lasting fun
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
did you explain
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
why we need to go back to a continuously
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
appropriate language
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman uh would it be possible
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
to uh somehow be better heard from your
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
conference room it is very difficult for
 
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
we'll move a microphone closer to
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative thomas and see if that
 
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.110 align:start position:0%
representative thomas and see if that
helps

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
um okay my question again senator is um
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
i understand the language in the current
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
law still contains uh
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
that it's a non-lapsing fund but can you
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
explain more why it needs to have a
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
continuously appropriated wording back
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
in there again what does it do
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question i mean
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding is because
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the fact that continually
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
appropriated is not in the statute
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
it has in certain circumstances
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
had money lapsing
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
that then can't be utilized from one
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
year to the next if it's continually
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated there's no spikes and
 
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.110 align:start position:0%
appropriated there's no spikes and
valleys

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
valleys
 
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
in the financing it can be appropriated
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
as the projects are moving forward and
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
so there's not a program suspension
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
and projects
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
financing being interrupted
 
00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:03.910 align:start position:0%
financing being interrupted
um

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
i think there's likely to be somebody
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
from the puc
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
on this call and they probably better
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
can answer that question but that's my
 
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.590 align:start position:0%
can answer that question but that's my
understanding

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
of why this change needed to be made to
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
prevent the disruptions
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
to the appropriations coming out of the
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
well thank you always for puc for the
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
follow on questions thank you
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
okay next step representative harrington
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
well i'm going to do exactly what doug
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
did i'll wait for the puc maybe they'll
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
answer my question before i have to ask
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
well just to clarify there is no one
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
from the puc who has signed up to speak
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh all right then maybe i'll ask it now
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
to senator bradley so in in that case uh
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i think that madeleine minau
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
would probably be the best person to
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay ms minnow is signed up to speak so
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative harrington i guess you
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
can hold your question for ms minnow
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll wait to see what she says
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you representative
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question actually
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
it's a similar question uh
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
but i'll do i'll ask it anyway um my
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
understanding has been that often the
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
funding for many projects
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
seem to have
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
stopped around july 1st and many people
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
had to wait till january of the next
 
00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.150 align:start position:0%
had to wait till january of the next
year

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
to be qualified or to receive the
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
support for their project
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
uh would would this bill uh help affect
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh the um
 
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
changing that schedule somewhat or not
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
well i
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna try to explain it a third time
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
um that is the whole rationale for the
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
bill because the existing language
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
means that there have been starts and
 
00:14:08.079 --> 00:14:09.269 align:start position:0%
means that there have been starts and
stops

00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
stops
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
in the funding of these projects so
 
00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:13.670 align:start position:0%
in the funding of these projects so
um

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know the language
 
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.269 align:start position:0%
you know the language
on

00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
line two and three of the bill
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
allows it to be continually appropriated
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
to smooth out the um the funding so
 
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.509 align:start position:0%
to smooth out the um the funding so
projects

00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
don't get suspended in mid-stream
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
thank you senator bradley i have a
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
when this legislation was originally
 
00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.110 align:start position:0%
when this legislation was originally
written

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
it was written in the form
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
that your bill proposes
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
but then about
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
four years ago i think it was
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:55.839 align:start position:0%
committee of the house
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
changed the wording to remove that
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
wording about continually lapsing do you
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
know why they did that i do not know why
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
they did that um representative i wish i
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
did because
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
we probably could have eliminated this
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
problem earlier but
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
that that is the problem has caused fits
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
and starts
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
and this bill corrects that it doesn't
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
um add more money to the renewable
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
energy fund
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
it it just allows the smoother
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
first i just like to say the yankee fan
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
envision with everything that has gone
 
00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:49.269 align:start position:0%
envision with everything that has gone
on

00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:51.670 align:start position:0%
on
that

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
the puc will still have control of these
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
funds and i'm specifically speaking to
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
the changes
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
that are coming up
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
should the department of energy pass
 
00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:05.990 align:start position:0%
should the department of energy pass
so

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
would this would this affect
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
others besides the puc
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
so if that fund was controlled by some
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
other entity
 
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.710 align:start position:0%
other entity
i'm

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
i i have not read the house bill 2
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
that you folks sent us with regard to
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
the department of energy i know that the
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
senate finance committee is asking a lot
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
of questions about that
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
i am assuming it would not change
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
anything but
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
that's a red sox fan okay thank you
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
so i noticed that uh representative i
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
mean um ms crampton from the puc is uh
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
on board with our call here this morning
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
i have uh made it possible for her to
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
speak and i know representative
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
harrington had a question that he wanted
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
to ask of somebody from the puc
 
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.630 align:start position:0%
to ask of somebody from the puc
so

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
ms crampton i'm going to recognize you
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
first because you had your hand up
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
so that you can make a comment and then
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
i'm going to turn it over to
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative harrington for a question
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead ms crampton
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you very much
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative vose i really do not have
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
a statement to make but there were a lot
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
of questions uh surrounding the fund and
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
why the continually appropriated is
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
needed and um
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
the non-null absent as well so i'm happy
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative harrington
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
why don't you go ahead with your
 
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.310 align:start position:0%
why don't you go ahead with your
question

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman uh yeah
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to find out here is it
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like what people are saying is
 
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.710 align:start position:0%
sounds like what people are saying is
that

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
coming because of a
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
somewhat of an artificial time deadline
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
that there's money that's in the fund
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
that doesn't get spent until the next
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
year is is let me start with that is
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.549 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
in a sense it is so what happens
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
currently is when the fund is not
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated
 
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.390 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated
funding

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
that comes in those are the alternative
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
compliance payments are able to be used
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
for projects and programs during the
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
current fiscal year
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
so our funding comes in by july 1st
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
those funds may be used between july 1st
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year through
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
june 30th
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
and what happens with the renewable
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
energy fund because we're incentivizing
 
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.870 align:start position:0%
energy fund because we're incentivizing
projects

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
july 1st is in the middle of the
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
construction season
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
and we're
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
approving projects throughout that
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
as soon as july 1st of the next fiscal
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
year starts
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
without the continually appropriated
 
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.350 align:start position:0%
without the continually appropriated
language

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
the funds from last fiscal year cannot
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
be used for those projects that are
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
did that
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so you're saying so july 1st it's
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
shut off but
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't where does the money then go
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
does it does it roll forward into july
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
2nd so it can be reappropriated or
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
no if it was continued that's what it
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
used to do when it was continually
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
appropriated it would simply roll
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
forward and we could continue to use it
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
for the programs that were i'm sorry the
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
projects that were under construction
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
when it's not continually appropriated
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it just remains in
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
but we are not able to use it
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman go ahead follow up
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm a little confused
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying it remains in the energy
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
fund but you can't use it so does that
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
mean we're having a some kind of an
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
unusable balance building up in this
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
fund year after year that just sits
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
without the continually appropriated
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
language yes that is correct
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up please
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
yes one more uh well what's the what's
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
the balance of this unavailable funds
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
that are sitting in the renewable energy
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
fund that we can't use right now
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
i i i'm sorry i don't have that figure
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay well i would hopefully someone
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
could get it for us because i think
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's kind of important if it's zero
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
then we don't have a problem if it's a
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars we do
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
it would become a problem year over year
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
so for example right now our programs
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
for this fiscal year were
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
roughly five million dollars
 
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.789 align:start position:0%
roughly five million dollars
um

00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:44.789 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
we still have
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
several million i'm not and this is why
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
i don't want to give you a number of
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
projects that we have approved for
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
development but those uh rebates and
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
grants have not yet been paid out
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
so it's that money is right there that
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
would be in jeopardy or would would
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know stay be on
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
not able to be spent
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry mr chairman one more follow-up
 
00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:15.750 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry mr chairman one more follow-up
please

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
make it quick please i'll make it very
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
quick so where does the money go then
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
i'm so that's not what i'm not hearing
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
you can't be spending it this year can
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
you spend it next year or is it just
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
sitting in a fund some place getting
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
larger every year that's what i'm
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
confused about
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
correct my understanding is without the
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
words continually appropriated
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
any funding from this fiscal year that
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
was not spent
 
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.190 align:start position:0%
was not spent
would

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
simply remain in the renewable energy
 
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.510 align:start position:0%
simply remain in the renewable energy
fund

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative plett
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
is uh recognized for a question i do
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
representative carrick has elicited me
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
from mrs crampton uh are we spending
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay hang on a second our representative
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
press next should be closer to the
 
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.630 align:start position:0%
press next should be closer to the
microphone

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
did you bring that microphone over
 
00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:20.789 align:start position:0%
did you bring that microphone over
please

00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
not very well
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
not very well at all
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.390 align:start position:0%
no
no

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
no not much
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
why don't you say a little more so
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
establish what you can hear you
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
how about now
 
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.909 align:start position:0%
how about now
better

00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
i think you sound great
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
representative harrington may have
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
already elicited the response from uh
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
miss crampton uh to my question but i'll
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
ask it a different way to make certain
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh is less money being spent
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
than is
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
available in the renewable energy fund
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
because it's uh it's not continuously
 
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:16.149 align:start position:0%
because it's uh it's not continuously
appropriate

00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
ms grampton
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
i i think the answer to that would be
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
yes i mean what ends up happening is you
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
have projects that have requested
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
funding that you are then no longer to
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
able to provide that funding for those
 
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.950 align:start position:0%
able to provide that funding for those
projects

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.270 align:start position:0%
projects
so

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
yeah every fiscal year if there's a
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
balance it would remain in the renewable
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
you i'm going to recognize
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to have to move on
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
because we still have
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
other people who want to testify on this
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
bill and we're near the end of our
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
our time slot so
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee could you ask a
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
quick question please i could do that
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
yes i was just wondering this is a has
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
an fn on it and it basically says under
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that the legislative
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
budget office was unable to complete the
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
physical note for the bill and was
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
awaiting additional information from the
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
puc so i'm suspecting that maybe some of
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
the answers to the questions around
 
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:30.490 align:start position:0%
uh the monetary piece are still to come
 
00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:31.909 align:start position:0%
uh the monetary piece are still to come
[Music]

00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of how much is left over and
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
not spent but i guess my question would
 
00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.390 align:start position:0%
not spent but i guess my question would
be

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
to the point that senator bradley made
 
00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:41.990 align:start position:0%
to the point that senator bradley made
around

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
the sort of consistency of people being
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
able to rely on funding through this
 
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.350 align:start position:0%
able to rely on funding through this
fund

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.070 align:start position:0%
fund
so

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
um are we
 
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:52.130 align:start position:0%
are we um
 
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.269 align:start position:0%
are we um
[Music]

00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
turning peop turning projects away or
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
to the fits and starts comment are we
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
funding them to a certain point and then
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
not providing the funding to complete
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
those projects like are there other
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
projects that are pulled up short that
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
are expected to go is that the kind of
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
inconsistency that is happening if we
 
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.350 align:start position:0%
inconsistency that is happening if we
don't

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
ms crampton
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
yes so what would happen is if for
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
example if i put in an application
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
today to construct a project a solar
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
system for example on my business or my
 
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.029 align:start position:0%
system for example on my business or my
home

00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
if i didn't complete that project and
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
request a
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
rebate to the commission by june
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
i would no longer have funding for that
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
project available
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
so if i didn't if the commission
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't pay or treasury could not re
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
pay my rebate by july 1st
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
that that promise of funding
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
so to speak for my eligible project
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
would not be available to be paid out of
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year's monies
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
those monies would in a sense
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
no longer be available and the
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
commission would have to decide then
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not they would use next
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year's monies to
 
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.149 align:start position:0%
fiscal year's monies to
um

00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
incentivize projects from this fiscal
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
year so that's where that continual
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
the continuity and the fits and starts
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
that's one of the places that that
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
happens follow up mr chairman make it
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
quick please
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
yep um just curious um
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
so does this limit the public utility
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
commission's ability to use the funds
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the manner in which they were
 
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.750 align:start position:0%
uh in the manner in which they were
intended

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
is crap then yes they can well if with
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
the addition of the continually
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
appropriated and non-lapsing language it
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
enables the commission to more
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
effectively and efficient efficiently
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
utilize the funds
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
and and and administer the programs
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
without those two words it's more
 
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
without those two words it's more
complicated

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
because we we
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
have to spend the money within a fiscal
 
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.510 align:start position:0%
have to spend the money within a fiscal
year

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you that's crampton
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%

try to be quick thank you so much i'm
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
madeline the executive director of clean
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
energy new hampshire and i would urge
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
you to vote ought to pass on this bill
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
as senator bradley did a good job of
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
explaining this is very necessary
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
i'm so sorry about my dog
 
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
because of um
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
having the ability for having the
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
commission the ability to use the funds
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
that are available in the renewable
 
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
energy fund to use it for the intended
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of making grant and rebates so
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
the example i'm going to give you right
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
now is that the legislative change
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
removing continually appropriated was
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
done in 2017 however the commission did
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
not start
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
applying that until this fiscal year
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
and so they switched over how the fund
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
is managed
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
this year there was a tremendous delay
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
in setting the budgets for this fiscal
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
year that caused a very long disruption
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
and uncertainty
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of the last fiscal
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
year my understanding was there was
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
roughly two and a half million dollars
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
left in the fund
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
the commission now does not have the
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
authority to use that balance in the
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
fund for its intended purpose to make
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
grant rebates
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
the residential solar rebate program is
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
out of funding for this fiscal year
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
even though there's a balance in the
 
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.230 align:start position:0%
even though there's a balance in the
fund

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
because the commission does not have the
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
authority to use the money in the fund
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
to fund the rebate program so they're
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
currently putting people on a waitlist
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
or turning them away from applying for
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
this rebate which is what this money was
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
intended to use for
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
while there's a there well there's money
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
in there also as has been explained
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
there's a huge disruption from one state
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to the next
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
um if you apply for rebate in may
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
you won't be able to finish your project
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
before the end of the state fiscal year
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
so you're probably going to be put on a
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
long wait list until the next
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year budgets are set to be
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
able to decide whether or not you are
 
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
eligible to be to receive a rebate so we
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
are asking that this be
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
changed back to continually appropriated
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
so that the state can better serve
 
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
customers that apply for a rebate or
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
grant program so that there's not such a
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
big disruption from one state fiscal
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
year to the next and that if there is
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
money available in the fund it can be
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
used for its intended purpose
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to take
 
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.789 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to take
questions

00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you ms minnow representative
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
sampson is recognized for a question
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
make it quick please yes thank you mr
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you miss minnow
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
would this bill also then allow the
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
current surplus of which you spoke to be
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
used for those purposes as well yes my
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is that if you all make
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
the fund continually appropriated again
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
the commission has the authority to use
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
any funds in the renewable energy fund
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
to fund the grant and rebate programs uh
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
that it's the intended use
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much i think we have
 
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
the committee has a clear picture of the
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
so i am going to close the public
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
hearing on senate bill 78
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
and i am going to open the public
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
hearing on senate bill 91.
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
now we have 18 people who have signed up
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
to testify on
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
bill 91 and what i would like to do
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
is i would like uh
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
people to
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
speak only on that part of the bill
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
to which they have a particular interest
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
or they have
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
particular expertise
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to recognize first senator
 
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
bradley as the prime sponsor to
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh introduce the bill senator bradley
 
00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:08.630 align:start position:0%
uh introduce the bill senator bradley
uh

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i think senator
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
waters is also the sponsor but
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
um let me just touch on very briefly
 
00:31:15.679 --> 00:31:16.710 align:start position:0%
um let me just touch on very briefly
section

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
two four and five
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
section two
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
deals with a particular application
 
00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:26.070 align:start position:0%
deals with a particular application
of

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facilities owned by
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
monadnock paper
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
in bennington new hampshire they're all
 
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
behind the meter as i understand it and
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
they are all under
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
um one megawatt and so they would
 
00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:41.350 align:start position:0%
um one megawatt and so they would
qualify

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to net meter but um because
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
of the fact that um
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
the rules by the public utilities
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
commission assume that they are greater
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
in total
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
the of the one megawatt
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
that is currently allowed by law they
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
have not been able to utilize the net
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
metering law that should apply to them
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
because there are three independently
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
licensed hydroelectric facilities so
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
fixes that and my understanding is it is
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
only particular to that facility of
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
monadnock paper
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to allow
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
former commissioner and former senator
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
clifton below
 
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.870 align:start position:0%
clifton below
to

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
talk about section 4 of the bill that
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
limited electrical producers and lastly
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
on section 5 as i understand that
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
senator avard may not be able to testify
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
he was
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of that piece
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding is representative vos
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman that um you have put
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
together a really good compromise that
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
brought in
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
all of the parties on
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
um aggregation
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
on house bill 315 which the senate has
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
and so we're pleased with that
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
and i think um house bill 315
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
probably is the best way to proceed
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
on the compromise that you have put
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
together so
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions um
 
00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:29.110 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions um
but

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
let me stop there
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you senator bradley i appreciate
 
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.190 align:start position:0%
thank you senator bradley i appreciate
that

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
i would urge the committee to
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
withhold questions as much as possible
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
so that we have a chance to get through
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
this long list of people who want to
 
00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.750 align:start position:0%
this long list of people who want to
testify

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'm next going to recognize
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
senator david waters
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
and senator waters will speak
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
specifically to
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
section one
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
senator waters are you there i am there
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr chairman do you hear me
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
now i can thank you sir
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so much mr chairman and
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
committee um i am senator david waters
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
district 4 and as as prime sponsor of
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
the of senate bill 91 let me just
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
mention that um
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
this came from the senate with an
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
anonymous vote of the energy committee
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
and uh 23 to
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
one on the floor um one member who was
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
upset that we took out
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
one section of the bill to make it more
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh bipartisan
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
um part one deals with energy
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
storage as you know from your
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
deliberations last year this is an
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
increasingly active area
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
a home of business owners and investors
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
looking for clarity and fairness in
 
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.030 align:start position:0%
looking for clarity and fairness in
regulation

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
the bill is meant to work in tandem with
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 715 which you passed
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
last year to set up a study by puc
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
on this matter but we need um this bill
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
to set clear legislative intent and
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
principles so the puc
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
regulators are not setting policy but
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature is as it
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
as it should
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
um as you can see from the bill it's
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's really about economic development
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
letting people get invested in this
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
in storage it's about consumer choice
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
property rights
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
and really taking advantage of storage
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
potentially to lower
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
energy costs and also a needed
 
00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:32.230 align:start position:0%
energy costs and also a needed
clarification

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
that energy storage is not counted as
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
generation for the purposes of sale into
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
the wholesale
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
market i want to thank you mr chairman
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
for your
 
00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:42.950 align:start position:0%
for your
suggestions

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
and advice on some changes here and i
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
look forward to the committees
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
pitching in to to make this better as
 
00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:50.950 align:start position:0%
pitching in to to make this better as
you

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
um see fit
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
so to get to the bill itself um this
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill replaces the existed existing rsa
 
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.270 align:start position:0%
bill replaces the existed existing rsa
374

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
374
 
00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.510 align:start position:0%
374
h

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
h
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
so there are some rewritings and
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
re-inclusions of what is currently
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
this is why the bill starts with a set
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
of definitions
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
these are essentially the same
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
definitions that already exist in 370
 
00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.870 align:start position:0%
definitions that already exist in 370
for

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.990 align:start position:0%
for
h

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
h
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of changes that i
 
00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.870 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of changes that i
will

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
go over
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
um on page 1 lines 30 to 31
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh it basically says you know if if the
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
puc finds that there are savings
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
due to storage they ought to account for
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
that in their um
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
rate setting
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
um and that's in section two
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
and then excuse me definition four
 
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.750 align:start position:0%
and then excuse me definition four
um

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
that it specifies that um anything we're
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
doing about storage
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
um is still the utilities do is still
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
regulated by 374 g1 so this does nothing
 
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:01.910 align:start position:0%
regulated by 374 g1 so this does nothing
to

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
undo the uh or recouple the uncoupling
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
that was done
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
um previous uh previously
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
um to get to
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
the new section then on page 2
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
374 h2
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
um i'll first point to uh
 
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.390 align:start position:0%
um i'll first point to uh
section

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
of part 1 1b there on consumer
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
rights um
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's very important here to recognize
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
that you know you have a right to do
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
what you want to do with your property
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
and if you want to have energy storage
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
in your property or in business you
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
ought to not be over regulated or
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
prohibited from doing that
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable way
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
i know the um mr chairman in one see
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
here where we want to ensure that
 
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.790 align:start position:0%
here where we want to ensure that
the

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
that there is reasonable and timely um
 
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.470 align:start position:0%
that there is reasonable and timely um
regulation

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh you have concerns about the words
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
affordable because you know what is
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
what how do you define affordable and uh
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
point well made so i i do agree with you
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
that perhaps that word affordable
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.710 align:start position:0%
should be
cut

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
cut
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
and then um on parts uh d d and e here
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
um this tries to get at the uh kind of
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not we will see
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
savings to transmission
 
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.390 align:start position:0%
savings to transmission
costs

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
in in these programs and um there's some
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
dispute over this as as you well know
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
between the utilities and iso new
 
00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:30.950 align:start position:0%
between the utilities and iso new
england

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
england
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
about new hampshire's share
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
among the states and its percentage of
 
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.870 align:start position:0%
among the states and its percentage of
share

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
due to transmission costs and the amount
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
of energy and it just seems fair that if
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
indeed there are
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
reductions to new hampshire's share
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
because we're reducing the amount of
 
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
energy draw because of storage
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
that that ought to be accounted for
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
i know you've heard from iso new england
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
that they don't really see this
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
you may hear a little bit later on from
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
the utilities that they do
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
but the bill itself is agnostic on that
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that they are there
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
aren't it just says if there are that
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
that ought to be
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
um accounted for
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh going down a little further in the
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
bill the section here h3
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh essentially reproduces um section h
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
what was section 82 and 374. so this is
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
nothing new it's just because it's a
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
repeal and replace this is there this is
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
the study that you approved
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
and uh the intent of of this bill senate
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
bill 91 part one is to work in tandem
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
with this that say as the results of
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
that study and what comes with that come
 
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.150 align:start position:0%
that study and what comes with that come
forward

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
then here are the guidelines from the
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
legislature as to how storage
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
should be and those results should be
 
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.069 align:start position:0%
should be and those results should be
under

00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
understood and again i just want to
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
reiterate how important i think it is
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
um that the puc not set policy but
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's what the that's what the
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
legislative branch
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
um is supposed to
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to do
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
um and then like to go down to um 374
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh g2
 
00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.190 align:start position:0%
uh g2
um

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
and uh here's where we get into that
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
question of how we're going to
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
um what how we're going to consider
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
electric uh generation equipment and uh
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
and uh primary energy and energy um
 
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.470 align:start position:0%
and uh primary energy and energy um
storage

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
storage
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
um equipment
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
you know i i think there's lots of ways
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
to slice and dice this mr chairman and i
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know you
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
your point is well taken that of course
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
when a battery produces energy it's
 
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
bruising it's producing energy and uh
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
and and i you know fair enough um so i
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
what i would hope here
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
is that um the committee might find some
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
languages satisfied uh with that just
 
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.270 align:start position:0%
languages satisfied uh with that just
essentially

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
um clarifies that storage is not counted
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
as generation for the purposes of sale
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
into the wholesale market
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
because that that that's the way we're
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
going to save money and
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
that's really the point of of all of
 
00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:09.589 align:start position:0%
that's really the point of of all of
this

00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
you also see online 30 on this page
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
a reference to benefiting low-income
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
customers this is kind of a principle
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's in other
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
parts of statute
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
of energy regulation it also reflects
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
the governor's often stated concern that
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
he wants to make sure that these new
 
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.030 align:start position:0%
he wants to make sure that these new
technologies

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
can benefit low-income customers and as
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know advocates are interested in
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
that as well so that that's why that's
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
there um i don't think it's
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
much of a change beyond the current
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
practices that we already have elsewhere
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
but since it's a new chapter um it'd be
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
good to have it in here as well
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
then the last part here uh the end of
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
page four starting uh page five
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
is simply a way of acknowledging
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
the ongoing and liberty utilities uh
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
energy storage
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
project up in lebanon um so that it just
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
says that uh that that project is
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledged here and and allowed to
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
continue under the um
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
strictures and regulations that were
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
established for that project by the
 
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.670 align:start position:0%
established for that project by the
puc

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
puc
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
and finally let me just say uh mr
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
chairman that you know we know that uh
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
we're gonna be seeing an energy
 
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.230 align:start position:0%
we're gonna be seeing an energy
department

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
and uh the puc will be
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
folded into that and i think that um you
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
know no matter how that uh that
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
department ends up and how those
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
functions end up being performed in the
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
energy department it's obvious there's
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
going to be puc-like functions and
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
regulation and dockets and
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
so it's it seems uh here with this bill
 
00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:46.150 align:start position:0%
so it's it seems uh here with this bill
that

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's just going to be essential
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
that uh that entity have the direction
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
and the legislative intent
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
on this uh burgeoning field of energy
 
00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.430 align:start position:0%
on this uh burgeoning field of energy
storage

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
storage
 
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
um i know there are a lot of other
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
people who are going to testify to more
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
details on this from the utilities and
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
others mr chairman but i'd be glad to
 
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:06.560 align:start position:0%

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you senator waters does anyone
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
have a question for the senator
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
chairman so i'll make this very quick
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
senator uh just as a matter of policy
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
from what we heard is that one section
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill is directed at a singular
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
company in new hampshire should we be
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
setting legislation to benefit a one
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
single company or should they adapt to
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
the existing rules
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
well thank you um
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh this um this project
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh has been approved is underway by the
 
00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:43.349 align:start position:0%
uh has been approved is underway by the
puc

00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
puc
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.309 align:start position:0%
and um
so

00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
it just seemed i mean it's underway
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
they're installing equipment and so on
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
and so i it just seems that um
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's kind of being
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
grandfathered essentially
 
00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:56.790 align:start position:0%
grandfathered essentially
so

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
moving forward of course it will be
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
subject in every other project
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
that it may wish to take by this
 
00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.870 align:start position:0%
that it may wish to take by this
legislation

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
thank you senator

senator avart asked that if you need me

bill
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
and the only reason that i've chosen um
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
one particular section to speak on is
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
only because we have some questions and
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
that is part four
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
and um part four is section four is the
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
host is the wholesale interest a concept
 
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.390 align:start position:0%
host is the wholesale interest a concept
section

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
and for us um we are i mean we've shared
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
this with others that um we don't know
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
if or how it could be accomplished um
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
we're not sure how to separate
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
transmission out of distribution we're
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
not sure if without other changes in law
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
that it would be legal and um as is we
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
fear that the language would be inviting
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
disagreements between generators buyers
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
and utilities which we would prefer to
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
avoid um generally speaking um if this
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
committee is going to have some work
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
sessions we'd be very happy to work with
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
the committee and see if there is some
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
language that we could come up with that
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
would kind of address our concerns but i
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to be on the record that
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
we have some concerns with the language
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
as is on section four and that's all i
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
have this morning thank you
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
thank you many questions for uh ms
 
00:46:05.599 --> 00:46:08.870 align:start position:0%
thank you many questions for uh ms
gamache

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will call next on
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
madeleine minow since uh we already have
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
her enabled to speak ms minnow why don't
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
you give your testimony now thank you
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so much mr chairman uh clean
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
energy new hampshire support senate bill
 
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:23.910 align:start position:0%
energy new hampshire support senate bill
91

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
91
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
oh i would love to speak on every part
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
but i think that would be too long so
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
i'll try and be brief
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
we definitely support part one related
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
to energy storage i think senator waters
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
did a great job of introducing that
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
and why it's needed uh we support part
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
two it would clarify that hydroelectric
 
00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.870 align:start position:0%
two it would clarify that hydroelectric
projects

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
that are individual however because of
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
the way they were originally constructed
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
are interconnected together should be
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
considered individually to decide
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
whether or not they are eligible for net
 
00:46:53.839 --> 00:46:54.870 align:start position:0%
whether or not they are eligible for net
metering

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
metering
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
and finally i will speak to part three
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
in a little bit more detail
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
the goal of part three would be to
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
effectively grandfather the low moderate
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
income community solar credit adder
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
which was created a couple of years ago
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
no projects have yet been constructed
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
that are eligible for
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
that adder and while we were going
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
through the rulemaking following the
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
legislation passing
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
all the developers said that it would be
 
00:47:22.319 --> 00:47:23.349 align:start position:0%
all the developers said that it would be
much

00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
more possible to finance such projects
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
if it was clear that the adder was
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
grandfathered on the same term that the
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
net metering credit is grandfathered so
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
that there's more certainty uh on the
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
continuation of the credit
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
going along with the net metering tariff
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
so that's the only thing that it's
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
trying to do it's not trying to change
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
what the adder is or make it last longer
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
or anything like that it's just trying
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
to really add more certainty around the
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
adder being available so that it might
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
be possible to finance such projects
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
with that i'll stop there we do uh
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
support the other parts i agree with
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
senator bradley that the last part
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
regarding community power likely that
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
can be handled through house bill 315.
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh seeing no questions for ms minnow i
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
would like to call on our next uh
 
00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.550 align:start position:0%
would like to call on our next uh
testifier

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
testifier
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
with senator rebecca perkins quoca
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
senator you have the floor
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you all good morning my name is
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
rebecca perkins cooka i'm the senator
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
representing district 21 the city of
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
portsmouth and
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
towns of madbury lee durham newington
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
newmarket and new fields um i was the
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of what is now
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
part three
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
madeleine just covered some of it for
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
you but just
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
to have additional background you know
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is the
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
clarification of the original language
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
um rsa 362 a9 um
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
originally intended to provide group
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
posts with a payment vehicle for excess
 
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.470 align:start position:0%
posts with a payment vehicle for excess
generation

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
generation
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
such excess generation compensation rate
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
is determined using the tariff
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
applicable to such group hosts but in
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
addition there's an adder
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
of a determined amount as specified in
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
this section three cents per kilowatt
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
hour for a two year period dropping to
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
two point five cents per kilowatt hour
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
after that
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
so the new language just intends to
 
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:25.829 align:start position:0%
so the new language just intends to
fix

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
fix
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
in other words hold stagnant the amount
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
of the adder at the time the project is
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
qualified by the puc for group host
 
00:49:32.319 --> 00:49:33.910 align:start position:0%
qualified by the puc for group host
metering

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
metering
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
as madeline mentioned this is important
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
to give certainty to those building and
 
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.630 align:start position:0%
to give certainty to those building and
financing

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
financing
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
solar projects you know any construction
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
financing from a bank requires a pro
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
forma set of financials to verify debt
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
service ratios and other relevant
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
criteria to financing so it's important
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
for the project to have a fixed income
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
stream which this language helps create
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment to the section that was
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
made in senate energy and natural
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
resources was simply to accommodate a
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
concern raised by the puc about
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
some of the language and just making
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
sure that they'd be able to enforce it
 
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.790 align:start position:0%
sure that they'd be able to enforce it
cleanly

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
cleanly
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
and i will stop there thank you mr
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
chairman and committee members for the
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify happy to answer
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think we may have a question for you
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
senator uh
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative oxenom is recognized for
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair for
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
recognizing me actually
 
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:31.990 align:start position:0%
recognizing me actually
and

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
with each of these presentations the
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
time available between when the person
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
stops talking and you ask if there are
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
any questions and then you say there
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
aren't any questions hasn't allowed me
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
to ask a single one of the questions
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
that i've wanted to ask this morning
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
um we we really don't need to be
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
operating at this breakneck speed i
 
00:50:55.119 --> 00:50:55.910 align:start position:0%
operating at this breakneck speed i
think

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's been such a pleasure to go to other
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
committees and testify where there is
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
deliberation and
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
a an opportunity for people to get their
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
head around what has been said to them
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
so that they can ask a question
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
um so at this point
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
i i'm not prepared to ask
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
other than to ask senator quoca if she
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
could explain the
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
the reason for the three cents and the
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
2.5 cents
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
what what what was the what criteria
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
were used in coming up with those
 
00:51:30.319 --> 00:51:32.950 align:start position:0%
were used in coming up with those
numbers

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am and respectfully
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham i may ask if
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
madeline minow can respond to that
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
particular question which may have been
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
who you intended to ask it to in the
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
first place um simply because that was
 
00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:47.829 align:start position:0%
first place um simply because that was
um

00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
part of the original bill that was
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
passed uh in the years prior to my being
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
part of this process so if if you
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind mr chair
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know no problem with me
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
yes i would be happy to answer um
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
when the bill that created the adder um
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
passed and was written the three cents
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
was i believe based on testimony from a
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
witness from the consumer advocate in
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
the net metering docket
 
00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:18.390 align:start position:0%
the net metering docket
de16575

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
de16575
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
or something like that the net meter the
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
last net metering docket
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
um there was consideration at the time
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not an adder should be
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
created for different reasons for this
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
type of project like the ones that serve
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
low moderate income um people or
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
dif projects in different locations so
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
there was discussion of adders
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe the three cents was
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
suggested by
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
some folks at vermont law school who
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
work on low moderate income community
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
solar it's also comparable to other
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
states that have similar programs
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
the step down to two and a half cents
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
was a negotiation
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
um i believe there's not really a
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
rationale for that other than um it was
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
more acceptable to pass the adder if
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
there was a step down after two years
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned no projects have been
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
constructed yet so no one at this point
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
would get the three cents if a project
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
was constructed it would go into service
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative samsic is recognized for
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you senator akoka um if i
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
understood correctly the motivation of
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
your portion of this bill is that you'd
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
like to streamline the business projects
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh from what what is going on now and
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
make that make these projects much more
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
predictable for everyone
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
is that the main motivation
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes sir exactly um and thanks for the
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
question so the intent is that there's
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
clarity for those who are proponents of
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects in their
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
finance years yep
 
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
see no more questions for senator
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
perkins cuoco we will move on to our
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%

ms crowley you have the floor for
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
three minutes
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman thank you very
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
much um for the record my name is heidi

kroll i work at gallagher callahan
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
gartrell and i'm
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
testifying today on behalf of two
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
clients that i have the granite state
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
hydropower association
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
and otherwise referred to as gsha and
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
monadnock paper mills um as you know
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
gsha is a voluntary
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
non-profit trade association for the
 
00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
small hydro
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
industry in new hampshire monadnock
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
paper mills is a family-owned business
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
located in bennington in new hampshire
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's the oldest continuously operating
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
paper mill in the country dating back to
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
1819 and the mill provides over 140
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
good-paying jobs in the monadnock region
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
um both clients support part two and
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
part four um and urge this committee to
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
pass on both of those parts part two and
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
part four of sb 91
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
furthermore we support the removal of
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
part 5 of the bill relative to the
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
aggregation community aggregation
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
i'll briefly explain other reasons for
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
these positions
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
first we support part two of the bill
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
because it will remedy a unique and rare
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
problem that monadnock paper mills
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
currently faces the problem is that
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
their three hydroelectric generators
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
which they use to help power the mill
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
share a single interconnection point
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
with the electric grid
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore they have not been able or
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate in net metering
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
even though each hydro unit is under one
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
megawatt and each is recognized by ferc
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire puc
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
as an individually licensed facility
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
part two will simply clarify that the
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
small scale hydro facilities at mononok
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
paper mills are eligible to participate
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
in net metering as customer generators
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
based on their individual total peak
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
generating capacity
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
and should not be prohibited from
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
participating simply because they share
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
a single interconnection point with the
 
00:56:06.559 --> 00:56:07.510 align:start position:0%
a single interconnection point with the
grid

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
grid
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
um part two of sb 91 you know rectifies
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
this problem and we respectfully request
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
passage of it
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
i would also note that i did reach out
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
to the puc and eversource about part two
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
when sb 91 was in the senate and um
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
after both uh checked internally they
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
both told me that they did not see any
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
problems um or concerns
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
and certainly no problems understanding
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
or implementing part two
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
we also support uh support part four of
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
the bill which makes long overdue
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
updates to new hampshire's limited
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
electrical energy producers act known as
 
00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.109 align:start position:0%
electrical energy producers act known as
lipa

00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
lipa
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
part four will finally enable local
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
buyers and local sellers of renewable
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
power in new hampshire to enter into
 
00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
mutually agreeable power sale contracts
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
while protections are in place for those
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
rate payers who are not party to the
 
00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.990 align:start position:0%
rate payers who are not party to the
contracts

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
we would be happy to work with committee
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
if it feels that part four needs any
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
further work um or amendments
 
00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.710 align:start position:0%
further work um or amendments
um

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
and part of the problem with the leipa
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
statute currently is that has never been
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
used so it's we would certainly um
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
welcome the opportunity to make that uh
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
usable um finally with respect to part
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
five um we understand that house bill
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
315 is the preferred vehicle um and so
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
part five of sb 91 does not um seem
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
necessary so uh we would support uh
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
removing part five and with that mr
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
chairman uh concludes my testimony and
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take any questions
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:47.109 align:start position:0%
 
who

00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
is a member of the public representing
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
himself mr bulgo golding you have the
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
floor for
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
two minutes
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman bows can you hear me
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
yes we can hear you
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
oh great
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
um so the big picture here in my view is
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
that the electricity market is somewhat
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
unique in terms of how big a role the
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
government has in terms of
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
directly setting the rules of the market
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
and as we all know the legislative and
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
rule making process invariably lags
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
behind the pace that technology and
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
consumer preferences change
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
so whenever that happens and it happens
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
we find ourselves in these situations
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
where the ways that market rules are
 
00:59:29.839 --> 00:59:31.109 align:start position:0%
where the ways that market rules are
written

00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually allow people in the
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
market to use the best technologies make
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
the best decisions and ultimately save
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
the most money they could be saving
 
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
so it falls to the legislature to
 
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
modernize the rules and that's what
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
parts one and four in particular of
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 91 does
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
cliff below of lebanon can speak more
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
than this but the high level context is
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
that in-state generation and battery
 
00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.430 align:start position:0%
that in-state generation and battery
storage

00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
storage
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
decreases the power we have to buy and
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
import from out of state using the
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
transmission grid
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
but right now the rules are set up so
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
that transmission grid charges are still
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
levied on electricity procured from
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
these local producers
 
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
and obviously
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
charging people for things they aren't
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
using makes no sense but in this case
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty big deal it's an unfair
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
tax essentially that averages 25
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour and could actually be
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
worth a lot more to batteries and other
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
technologies that can intelligently
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
dispatch power by targeting those peak
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
hours 30 seconds um
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill 91 modernizes
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
the rules it removes the price
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
distortion provides the clean price
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
signal and fixes the market for projects
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
across new hampshire i think it'll be a
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
shot in the arm for project construction
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that every
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
representative would support these
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
common sense pro new hampshire market
 
01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.670 align:start position:0%
common sense pro new hampshire market
reforms

01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
reforms
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
lastly just in response to concerns
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
raised i just want to say that whenever
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
you modernize the rules business as
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
usual does have to change market
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
participants utilities the puc have to
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
think it through and implement it
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
but that's just that's not an
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
argument for delaying the passage of
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
reforms all it means is we have to do a
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
bit of work on the back end to
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
implement more modern market rules thank
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you mr golding i
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
any questions for mr goldberg
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will call on next speaker
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
the next speaker is henry erndon
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
mr hermann the floor is yours for three
 
01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.309 align:start position:0%
mr hermann the floor is yours for three
minutes

01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
hello chairman can you hear me
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
i can
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
hello members of the committee my name
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
is henry herndon i'm an energy
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
professional here in the state
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
um and i really first got involved with
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
this committee during the house bill 315
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
effort and i was very pleased uh to see
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
the strong collaborative process to put
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
forward good common sense market-based
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
energy policy that was uh that was
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
really bipartisan and really
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
appreciative of your leadership uh
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
chairman votes on that and in that vein
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
just that briefly i'll speak in support
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 91 particularly part four
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh the previous speaker touched upon a
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
couple of the issues i wanted to address
 
01:02:20.079 --> 01:02:21.589 align:start position:0%
couple of the issues i wanted to address
but

01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
so i'll be brief but i'll just boil this
 
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
down to say that
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
the benefits of this bill are creating a
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
market-based approach that avoids any
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
possibility of subsidy
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
for communities to build uh and benefit
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
from energy projects and storage here in
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
the state there's currently not a
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
mechanism there's clearly a lot of
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
demand uh we see that with the net
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
metering fights over the past three
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
years that's a policy that we haven't
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
come to agreement on and this really is
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
a way to
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
create a mechanism for communities to
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
benefit from development of solar and
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
storage in their communities and
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
reduce costs in that sense i'm not
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
surprised to hear um eversource sort of
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
you know casting a little bit of doubt
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
on this bill because as we've discussed
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
this is going to reduce transmission
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
costs for communities because we'll
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
alleviate their reliance on the
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
transmission grid and enable them to
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
lower their transmission costs um so so
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
um i don't think we should sort of let
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
that distract us from the benefits of
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
local economic development lowering
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
costs and really creating markets for
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
communities so i encourage all of you to
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
support senate bill 91 and i would be
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions if any
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
members of the committee have questions
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you

mr herndon
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
if you can be as specific as possible
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
could you please tell us
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
how this is going to save transmission
 
01:03:53.119 --> 01:03:54.789 align:start position:0%
how this is going to save transmission
costs

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
yes it's a good question thank you um
 
01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.870 align:start position:0%
yes it's a good question thank you um
representative

01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
so when a generator connects to the
 
01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
distribution grid
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
and sells power to a purchaser locally
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
say a community power program say for
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
example the city of nashua wants to buy
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
power from its hydro dams and supply
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
that to its residents and businesses
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
through a community power aggregation
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
that power does not
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
interface with the transmission grid at
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
the wholesale level because it's under
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
five megawatts and if that generator is
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
registered at under 5 megawatts it's not
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
registered it doesn't have to be
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
registered in the wholesale market now
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
in particular if that generator is
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
producing electricity during the monthly
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
peak hour then that electricity is
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
reducing the transmission peak for that
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
month and transmission peaks are set
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
monthly so if you have a generator in
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
nashua providing power locally to its
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses
 
01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
during the monthly peak that is that is
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
directly lowering transmission peaks
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
directly lowering transmission costs and
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
the language in second part four of this
 
01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.109 align:start position:0%
the language in second part four of this
bill

01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh would ensure that if that's measured
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
if it's actually measured that during
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
that same time we're reducing
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
transmission costs then the the people
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
paying for that power wouldn't have to
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
pay for those transmission costs i hope
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
that gets at your question
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you it was a very uh precise and
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative harrington for the
 
01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.430 align:start position:0%
representative harrington for the
question

01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
representative occident i'm trying to
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
give you uh time to formulate a question
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
are you okay
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much sir i really
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate that i you know i i really
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
try to listen to the speaker and and not
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
come in with a pre-formulated question i
 
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate that description of
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
of how the peak
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
reduction and the peak pricing
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
translates into those reduced costs that
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
was really useful i thought i had a
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
question but
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
henry really took it out from under me
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
so um thank you very much and and thank
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee has a question
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead and try to make it quick and
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
brief representative
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
you don't have to say it every time i
 
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.349 align:start position:0%
you don't have to say it every time i
understand

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:06:25.359 --> 01:06:26.950 align:start position:0%
understand
um

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
you opened uh mr herndon
 
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
mentioning a market-based approach and
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
you also made reference to the fact that
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
there would be no subsidy and i think
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
that that is a recurring theme with
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
bills that we hear in our committee so
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
could you say a little bit more about
 
01:06:41.839 --> 01:06:43.029 align:start position:0%
could you say a little bit more about
how

01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
section 4 does not contribute in any way
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
to uh subsidies
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i can speak to that um so the
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
reason i use that language is because
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
this would allow for just a bilateral
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
negotiated contract so the price would
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
be set by whatever the agreed upon terms
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
are between the generator or the seller
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
and the the customer the buyer who could
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
be a large energy user or it could be a
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
community power program so because it is
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
a negotiated contract price it's not a
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
rate that's set by regulators or by the
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
state and what we get in net metering
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
is a rate that is set by regulators and
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
there is disagreement on the values and
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
the benefits associated with net
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
metering there are studies that show
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
that you know all this distributed
 
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
generation out on the grid it's it's
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
doing just that same concept of load
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
reduction and it's suppressing wholesale
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
market prices and suppressing
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
transmission costs
 
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
so there's value there but then there's
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
disagreements on on sort of uh the
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
distribution credit and other assets so
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
so just essentially the difference here
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
is this is purely a negotiated price on
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
that metering i you know we won't get
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
into that debate there but there's there
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
is a debate on the values and benefits
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
of net metering as it is a rate set by
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcgee
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
representative samson is recognized for
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:12.710 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
hearn

01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
hearn
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh as a energy analyst
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
how do you define the difference between
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh that that's
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
the difference between battery storage
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
and energy generation one is producing
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
power the other is is simply storing up
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
power and then providing it to the grid
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
and they can perform similar types of
 
01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.349 align:start position:0%
and they can perform similar types of
services

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
but importantly this build would remove
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
barriers to battery storage and there's
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of benefit there because as we
 
01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.390 align:start position:0%
a lot of benefit there because as we
know

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
some of the most developable resources
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
are things like solar in the state but
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
solar is an intermittent resource and if
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
you compare that with energy storage you
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
can maybe really target your solar power
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure you're hitting for example
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
peak time usage so you soak you fill up
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
your battery in the middle of the day
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
with your with your cheap solar power
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
and then when that uh evening ramp comes
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
along and and uh the solar power
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
generation falls off
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
um that creates an opportunity to put
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
that power back on the grid from the
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
battery and that's really how you're
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
going to ensure you're measuring
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
that power is going on to the grid
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
during the transmission peak or during
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
the capacity peak so it's so you can
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
measure that it's reducing those costs
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
and pass all of those savings on to the
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses and communities
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
so mr hernan would you agree with me
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
that a battery storage
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
unit would be a generator if if more
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
energy came out of it than you put into
 
01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.229 align:start position:0%
energy came out of it than you put into
it

01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
i would not agree that a battery storage
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
project would be a generator i would say
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
that battery storage could be paired
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
with generation and work
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
synchronistically with it
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
mr herndon i have a question for you
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
can you explain to the committee
 
01:10:18.159 --> 01:10:20.390 align:start position:0%
can you explain to the committee
why

01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.270 align:start position:0%
why
this

01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.149 align:start position:0%
this
uh

01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
the approach to buying and selling
 
01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
energy as suggested by this legislation
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
is superior to
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
the current
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
system whereby
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
buyers and sellers of electricity can
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's a good question i'll give it a shot
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i can answer you but
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this so uh this
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
particular legislation it's it's
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
addressing the limited producers uh
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
piece of law and i'm forgetting the
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
exact the exact rsa reference um
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
but the existing i don't know exactly
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
the details of why that existing law is
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
not functional but it has to to date not
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
been used and um it is constructed in
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
such a way that that prevents the market
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
from being able to make use of it so the
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
part 4
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
is to correct those imperfections and
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that we can actually have a
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
marketplace in the state and we can
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
allow large energy users and communities
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
to to benefit from local generation as
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to being sort of trapped in the
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
a system that requires them to pay for
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
imported power from out of state
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't answer your question about
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
the power purchase agreement directly um
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
i apologize for that
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's quite all right
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
you did your best i appreciate it
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh are there any other questions from
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none before i call on the next
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
speaker i just want to
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
assure the committee that
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
the last speaker of the day on this bill
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
clifton below and he is intimately
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
familiar with the details of
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
many if not all of the sections of this
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
bill so
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
he will get plenty of time to speak
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
and there will be plenty of time to
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
ask him questions
 
01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.030 align:start position:0%
ask him questions
afterwards

01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
so now i'll call on the next speaker who
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
is katherine corkery representing the
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%

committee this is katherine corkery i'm
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
the chapter director of new hampshire
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%

registering support for this bill
 
01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.110 align:start position:0%
registering support for this bill
um

01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
and really the the only concerns that i
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
had have already been brought up um and
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
that is the proposal
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
of the department of energy
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh and the role that it could play
 
01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh in this bill and in the previous bill
 
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.590 align:start position:0%
uh in this bill and in the previous bill
um

01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if this committee has
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
really discussed the proposal
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
for the department of energy because it
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
was in the budget
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
um but i i just wanted to
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
voice my concern for that
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
and secondly
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
the other concern that has already been
 
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.070 align:start position:0%
the other concern that has already been
addressed

01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
is your bill hb 315 and
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
making way for for that bill to progress
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%

01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
will summarize uh
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%

committee for your work on this bill and
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%

below will be coming later i can keep my
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
testimony very short and hopefully give

him time for all sorts of questions i'm
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
with an amendment or elimination of part
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
five i've been an active community
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
member in enfield on the energy
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
committee we are also interested in
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
community power
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
in our town and i'm also a
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
co-owner and employee of revision energy
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
so i've been in the solar energy field
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
for a lot of years i feel very strongly
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
that we must do what we can to reduce
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
and eliminate fossil fuels as quickly as
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
possible and address the many issues
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
that have resulted from
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
from their use
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
sb 91 includes important articles that
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
would support
 
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
increased renewables and distributed
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
storage which i think is something we
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely have to address and community
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
power programs also of course extending
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
the low and moderate income
 
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
pieces to that is also extremely
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
important i think so thank you again for
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
your work on this bill and
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
we hope to make new hampshire uh have a
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you miss quirk we appreciate your

01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none and i will turn to our next
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
speaker who is mark
 
01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:33.750 align:start position:0%
speaker who is mark
vader

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
vader
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
and he did not originally sign up to
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
speak but he had his hand raised so i'll
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
allow mr batter to speak thank you mr
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
was just looking at the text for sb 91
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
on um
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
in in section four
 
01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.149 align:start position:0%
in in section four
subsection

01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
subsection
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
um six
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
it says
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
purchasers of power from limited
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
producers shall pay for the delivery of
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
such power through tariffs charges and
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
rates that are generally applicable to
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
the customer's rate class
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
and to me that does not sound like a
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
purely negotiated rate
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if we have our facts
 
01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:23.030 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if we have our facts
wrong

01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
okay that's a legitimate question
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'm going to suggest that we ask that of
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
clifton below when he testifies
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
would that be satisfactory to you mr
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
batter very very good thank you
 
01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
that we are out of speakers
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
who will be
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
clifton below
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.199 --> 01:19:16.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
so clifton below
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
former puc commissioner former state
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative former state senator
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh mr biela you have the floor and i'm
 
01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
going to give you more time than usual
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
because i know you have extensive
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
information to provide about this bill
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
and we'll have
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to ask you questions
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
so i hope you heard mr vader's question
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
a few moments ago and if so that you can
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
incorporate that into your testimony and
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
answer to that question
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
and i now ask you to take it away
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman um members of
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for the
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh to testify on
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 91. um i'll just go ahead
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
and answer that uh question that was
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
just raised
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
just to to uh before i forget um and it
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
was a question it's on page seven lines
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
29 to 32
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
and it says purchases a power from
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
limited producers shall pay the deliver
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
for the delivery of such power through
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
you know the normal tariffs the delivery
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
of the power it would be the
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
distribution rate um that is applicable
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
to the customer so that is not
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
negotiated that is set by the puc it is
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
a separate charge then the power itself
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
the generation of the power um so in in
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
the current um rsa 362 a 2a
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
there is a provision that talks about
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
having wheeling charges um apply
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
that language goes back to 1979 before
 
01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
there was open access to transmission or
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
customer choice any choice of uh
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
generation supply
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
so it's really that is really an
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
antiquated part of the current statute
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh that instead recognizes that um
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
even if the power plant is right next
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
door um
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
but you're using the distribution lines
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the distribution utility you would
 
01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
still pay the normal distribution rate
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
so that's what that's about
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
so let me back up to the big picture um
 
01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.149 align:start position:0%
so let me back up to the big picture um
here

01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:21:20.159 --> 01:21:21.030 align:start position:0%
here
um

01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
i would note that it was
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
some 20
 
01:21:24.719 --> 01:21:25.750 align:start position:0%
some 20
um

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
three years ago
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
in 1970
 
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.070 align:start position:0%
in 1970
1997

01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
1997
 
01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
when i was serving on this committee
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
that i sponsored i was the prime sponsor
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
of the bill that originally created net
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
metering uh then representative bradley
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
then the chair of this committee uh was
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
was my co-sponsor on that bill
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
and we actually worked through a great
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
many work sessions on the bill that
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
created net metering it also revised rsa
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
362 a 2a
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
to a limited extent and made other
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
revisions to the overall limited
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
producer statute that eliminated the
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
requirement for the utilities themselves
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
to purchase power
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
from limited producers
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
because it was sort of recognized as
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
predator restructuring it really wasn't
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
the utility necessarily to be purchasing
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
um output from limited producers uh
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
called qualifying facilities under the
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's limited producer statute
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
was a forerunner too um in any case
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
um as part of that um we did state at
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
the time um
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
as part of the purpose section of the
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
statute that we thought net metering
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
was one way that customers could have
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
access to a choice of
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
renewable generation but that it was
 
01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.430 align:start position:0%
renewable generation but that it was
also

01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
intended primarily for early adopters
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
and that language about it being for
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
early adopters was subsequently um
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
removed by the statute in in more recent
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
years um
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
but quite honestly i never really
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
imagined that net metering would grow to
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
the point where people were looking at
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh two three four wanting to have four
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
megawatt size projects um participate in
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
that metering because at that point you
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
know it's really all about group net
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
metering even a lot of the projects
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
between 100 kw and 1 megawatt are about
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
group net metering which is essentially
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
one at one site you're producing the
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
power and other uh customers and the
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
customers or the off takers to that
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
power supply um so part four of the bill
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
is an effort to um
 
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.430 align:start position:0%
is an effort to um
uh

01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
modernize that existing statute uh that
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
enables a limited producer to sell
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
either at retail or uh within the state
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
to a supplier
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
at essentially a wholesale uh
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
transaction within the state
 
01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.870 align:start position:0%
transaction within the state
um

01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
and and to you know put some context on
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
this this this i see part four the bill
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
as a real compliment to what um house
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
bill 315 does in enabling community
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
power aggregations
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
here in lebanon as we've tried to
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
develop the concept of lebanon community
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
power we have talked with a number of
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
businesses and institutions who've been
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
very interested in the idea of being
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
able to purchase power through a
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
purchase power agreement from a local
 
01:24:21.679 --> 01:24:22.790 align:start position:0%
purchase power agreement from a local
renewable

01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
renewable
 
01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:23.830 align:start position:0%
renewable
source

01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
and at the same time we've actually been
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
approached by a couple of property
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
owners who own sites that are suitable
 
01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:30.629 align:start position:0%
owners who own sites that are suitable
for

01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh solar projects that might be in the
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
one to five megawatt range
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
and they don't want to just you know
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
they their thought is they would like to
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
use their land to benefit the community
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
and so they
 
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
and one of these landowners we had a
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
conversation with a year two ago just
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
called me up um on friday to ask um that
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
he'd still like to see his land use for
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
a large-scale solar project and would
 
01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
really like to be able to sell that
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
through lebanon community power
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
to local uh residents or businesses
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
um and at the same time um just a couple
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
weeks ago i was also approached by a
 
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
major developer in in this area a check
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
clem of uh lime properties which has
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
been working to develop a 38 acre site
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
in west lebanon that has already
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
received um
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
necessary zoning changes as well as site
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
plan approval for up to 850
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
000 square feet of mixed use but
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
primarily um offices uh particularly
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
targeting the biotech industry um he has
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
found that a lot of his potential um
 
01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:37.590 align:start position:0%
found that a lot of his potential um
tenants

01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
tenants
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
and he started construction in the first
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
building on this site are interested
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
they have sustainability goals and
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
they're very interested in the idea of
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
being able to purchase local renewable
 
01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.910 align:start position:0%
being able to purchase local renewable
energy

01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
the sort of uh under one megawatt
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
groupnet metering you know might work a
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
little bit in some
 
01:25:55.199 --> 01:25:56.550 align:start position:0%
little bit in some
applications

01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
applications
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
but really
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
more scale is needed
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
so right now we have a situation where
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
under one megawatt can participate in
 
01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
anything that's five megawatts or larger
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
is required to participate in the iso
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
new england markets
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
those are the interstate power markets
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
for bulk power supply and it's generally
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
accepted that larger than five megawatts
 
01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
or even smaller if you're connected
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
directly to the transmission grid is uh
 
01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
the size that it should be considered
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
producing in interstate commerce that
 
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
puts it under first jurisdiction in the
 
01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
rules of iso new
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
england at the same time
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
though going back to the federal power
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
act that was enacted in the 1930s
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
congress made very clear that ferc's
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction is limited to
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
a transmission in interstate commerce
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
in with regard to energy markets and
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
power supply sales at wholesale
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh to another purchaser is going to
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
resell it
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
in interstate commerce
 
01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
and that's a clearly defined term in the
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
federal statute um
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
that that is uh i cited in my written
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
testimony which you probably haven't
 
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to look at because
 
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
i just emailed it to you earlier this
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
morning but i have provided written
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
testimony that provides a lot of these
 
01:27:21.679 --> 01:27:23.990 align:start position:0%
testimony that provides a lot of these
details

01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
details
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
interstate uh commerce as
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
a situation where energy um
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
that is uh generated in one state is
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
transmitted from a state and consumed at
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
any point outside thereof
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
and uh and so the authority of the ferc
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
does not extend to sales of electricity
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
in what is called intra-state within the
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
state wholesale commerce or at retail
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
um so new hampshire law has long sort of
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
recognized this sort of
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
regulatory opportunity if you will or
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
it's jurisdiction which is to say new
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire has jurisdiction over
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
generation and and storage as well
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
that is under five megawatts and is not
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
registered with iso new england as a
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
generation asset
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's worth noting that iso new england
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
um defines a generator asset as a device
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
that or collection of devices that's
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
capable of injecting real power onto the
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
grid and has been registered as a
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
generator asset uh in accordance with
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
the uh iso new england rules
 
01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:40.790 align:start position:0%
the uh iso new england rules
um

01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
so a battery
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
by that definition can be and is
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
considered a generator because it can
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
inject a real power into the grid and as
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
such um if they're five megawatts or
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
larger they need to register with new
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
england if they're going to be injecting
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
power into the grid even if connected to
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
the distribution grid but if they're
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
smaller than that they don't they don't
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
have to register with iso new england
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
so we kind of have a gap which is part
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
of what part one is trying to address is
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
the notion of distributed storage and by
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
distributor i mean connected to the
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
distribution grid under five megawatts
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
and and not participating in the first
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional interstate uh power
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
market if if you've got a generator that
 
01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.270 align:start position:0%
market if if you've got a generator that
um

01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
or storage that meets that criteria
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
the only real option is net net metering
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.790 align:start position:0%
at the moment
um

01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:35.990 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's why there's so much pressure to
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
expand net metering from one megawatt to
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
five megawatts
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
and i think the time has come that we
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
need to move away from net metering for
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
these large projects and look at a more
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
market-based approach that fairly
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
compensates those assets without by
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid cross subsidies so that
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
this is sustainable over the long term
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
on its own merits
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
and i've you know just given a couple
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
examples of potential buyers and sellers
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
within the city of lebanon who would
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
like to be able to do that um but but
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
it's difficult under current law
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
i have attached as part of my testimony
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
towards the end of it
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
is a copy of the current statute rsa 362
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
a 2a
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
and you can take a look at that and see
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
that it is somewhat archaic but it does
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
by its plain language enable a limited
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
producer to sell up to any three
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
customers whether they be at retail or
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
within state wholesale
 
01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.350 align:start position:0%
within state wholesale
um

01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
up to three without
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
puc approval and more than three if you
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
went through a process to get puc
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
approval for more when this idea first
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
came up a couple years ago
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
we heard from the from pretty much
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
everyone we talked with including uh
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
utilities that there's no particular
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
reason to have that limit of three um so
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
part of what the new uh language does is
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
expand that uh to any number of of
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
customers that could be served by a
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
limited producer uh sort of like group
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
net metering exists today for up to one
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
megawatt there could be any number of
 
01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
members of a group um
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
the you know i recognize that this
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
similar language came forward to the
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
committee as part of house bill 295
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
sponsored by representative pearl
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
and house bill 417 uh sponsored by
 
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee and both of those
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
bills i believe you voted in expedient
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
and so the first explanation might be
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
well let's take this out and and just
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
not have this part of the bill because
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
you've already taken a position on that
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
in talking with the chairman i i
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
realized that there were a number of
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
concerns that were raised about um this
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
some of this language that you didn't
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
really have time to adequately address
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh but i my hope is that you will take
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
the time now uh to consider this
 
01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.270 align:start position:0%
the time now uh to consider this
um

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
part four of the bill and work let's try
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
to work with the stakeholders as we did
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
on house bill 315 to see if we can't
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
resolve concerns uh such as those that
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
miss gamache just raised on behalf of
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
eversource i have opened a dialogue uh
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
with with miss gamache
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
and eversource to try to understand
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
their concerns and try to address those
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh to some extent my testimony does
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
elaborate on on the jurisdictional
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
issues i think one really important one
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
that i that i'd like to call your
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
is is the fact that um traditionally net
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
meter generation
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
has not has functioned as a load reducer
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
relative to the iso new england markets
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
as well as for transmission cost
 
01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
allocation i think you've heard this
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
before but i'll just reiterate
 
01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
the way transmission cost allocation
 
01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.070 align:start position:0%
the way transmission cost allocation
works

01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
the all the transmission owners figure
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
out their revenue requirements that goes
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
through an approval process so we have a
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
total revenue requirement
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
for transmission so an overall rate per
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
kw based on the projected uh
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
kw or megawatt demand uh on the system
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
is is projected and then those costs are
 
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
allocated over the course of the year
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
based on each month's
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
single hour of coincident peak
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
so you've got a monthly
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
hour of highest demand on the new
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
england system and that demand is what's
 
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
called regional network load and all
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
those transmission costs get allocated
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
to regional network load based on their
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
share that that total there's also
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
something called local network it sort
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
of parallels regionals so i'm not going
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
to explain that but but it's essentially
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
the same thing but for portions of the
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
transmission grid that only serve parts
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
of new england
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
so eversource and national grid own both
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
regional uh networks as well as what's
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
called local although the local just
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
means it's just serving a limited number
 
01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
of distribution systems uh
 
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
in new england
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
so the regional network load is
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
basically the load as measured at the
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
meter that exists between the
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
first jurisdictional transmission grid
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire jurisdictional
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
distribution grid
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
and so you measure that load
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
and then there's an adjustment so if you
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
have a bulk generator that's putting
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
their power onto the distribution grid a
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
generator say that's 10 megawatts um
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
then their output is not considered to
 
01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:49.430 align:start position:0%
then their output is not considered to
reduce

01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:34:51.110 --> 01:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
the distribution system load or the
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
retail load so you would add that
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
generation output at that hour of
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
coinstone peak demand to what is
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
measured at that
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh meter between the transmission grid
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
and the distribution grid but you
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
increase the regional network load by
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
the output of
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
generation assets those that are
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
registered with iso new england
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
and that is used for the allocation
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
but if generation
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
such as net meter generation that's not
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
registered with iso new england or
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
anything up to five megawatts that's not
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
registered with iso new england
 
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
if it reduces the load on the
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
distribution grid by essentially
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
directly serving it over the
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
distribution grid rather than requiring
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
the power to come in from trans over
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
transmission then it does in fact reduce
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
the regional network load there's been
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
some confusion about this about some of
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
the language and the tariff so over the
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
past year there's been a process at iso
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
new england to clarify that language
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
i did include a slide deck from a
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
presentation to the iso new england's
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
market committee that was made on behalf
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
of transmission owners including
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
eversource and national grid in which
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
the transmission owners have proposed a
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
clarifying definition
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
that says i'll just read it to you and
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
it is quoted again in my written
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
testimony network customers monthly
 
01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
regional network loads shall exclude one
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
load offset by any resources that is not
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
a generator asset
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
meaning it's not registered with iso new
 
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
england which means it is by definition
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
under five megawatts
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
and two yeah
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
yes uh did you just say that what you're
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
reading is in your written testimony yes
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
i did
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
can i suggest that since we only have 20
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
minutes left okay
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
that you consider
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
allowing the committee to read your
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
and maybe wrap up your writ your spoken
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
testimony now so that we'll have
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
adequate time for questions because i
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
know the committee has a lot of
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
questions for you so certainly i'll wrap
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
up in a minute or two here um so so
 
01:37:08.229 --> 01:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
basically the clarification
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:10.950 align:start position:0%
would allow
um

01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
these under five megawatts to function
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
as load reducers
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
both for the market purposes and for the
 
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
transmission charges
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
um having said that i do want to briefly
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
mention that i also suggest one a fairly
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
minor but but but substantive and impact
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
um amendment to part one of the bill um
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
which is just where there's a definition
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
of wholesale electricity markets
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
it means any energy capacity or
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
ancillary service market that iso new
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
england operates i suggest adding the
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
words or that may operate pursuant to
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
rsa 362 a 2a because the current
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
language in that statute does enable a
 
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
within state wholesale transaction and
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
it would more clearly allow that
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
if if the
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
language along the lines of part four
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
the bill were adopted the reason for
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
that is because
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh that definition is used in part one
 
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
of the bill to direct the commission to
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
investigate ways to enable energy
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
storage projects to receive compensation
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
for avoided transmission costs while
 
01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
also participating in wholesale energy
 
01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.390 align:start position:0%
also participating in wholesale energy
markets

01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
markets
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
but i would submit that if they're
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
participating in the iso online energy
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
or capacity markets they will have no
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
effect on reducing transmission because
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
their output is added to regional
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
network load which which is how costs
 
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
are allocated
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
so if you simply also look at the option
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
of what happens if they aren't
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
registered with iso new england or small
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
enough that they could be selling uh
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
direct at retail or within state
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
wholesale then you may actually see the
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
realization of that value and finally
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
i'll just also mention that uh there's
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
another suggested amendment um in in my
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh testimony um
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
to add
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
to part four of the bill where it sets
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
criteria um that in order to qualify for
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
this limited producer within state sales
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
you can't also be participating in iso
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
new england ice nicer new england
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
markets and but isolation has created an
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
exception to that which is for
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
an alternative technology regulation
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
resource and you'll see in the slide
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
decks an illustration of how this new
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
tariff language would apply and if a
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
storage system was
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
only functioning as an alternative
 
01:39:30.159 --> 01:39:31.750 align:start position:0%
only functioning as an alternative
technology

01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
resource a regulation of regulation
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
resource then it would still function as
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
a load reducer for transmission cost
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
allocation and it's simply because
 
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
battery storage in particular is very
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
good at providing regulation services uh
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
with with what's called you know a smart
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
inverter um it can provide some of the
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
services that bug generators provide on
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
the transmission grid and there's sort
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
of there's been a determination in
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
iceland new england in the new pool
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
processes that would be okay to let
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
generation that's otherwise functioning
 
01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159 align:start position:0%
as a load reducer to provide that one
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
regulation resource without having to
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
register as a generator asset so i'll
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
stop there and open it to questions my
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
my hope is that you'll take this
 
01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh you've got some time here
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh to take a closer look at this part
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
four and see if we can't improve upon
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
the language address concerns that uh
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
utilities or other stakeholders and
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
committee members may have and and try
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
to come up with something that that
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
really um
 
01:40:38.229 --> 01:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh can can help solve this dilemma how
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
to best uh accommodate one to five
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
megawatt uh generation and battery
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
storage on our distribution grid thank
 
01:40:44.639 --> 01:40:46.550 align:start position:0%
storage on our distribution grid thank
you

01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr bilo i knew that you
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
would provide us with
 
01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.830 align:start position:0%
would provide us with
a

01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
a hose full of uh information for us to
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
consume i have a couple of questions
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
on section one of the bill both you and
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
senator waters have mentioned
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
that there are weaknesses in the
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
legislation as passed by the senate
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
that need
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
some tweaking
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
so my question for you is before we
 
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
undertake that work
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
which could turn into a considerable
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:23.510 align:start position:0%
amount of
effort

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
what is the reason for passing this
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
legislation today in other words could
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
this legislation wait until next year
 
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
where it could be reworked to deal with
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
the issues that have been uh uncovered
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
um well of course you can always wait um
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
sort of urgency to it if you will
 
01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:48.709 align:start position:0%
sort of urgency to it if you will
is

01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:41:48.719 --> 01:41:50.229 align:start position:0%
is
that

01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
right now it's really unclear under what
 
01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
conditions the customer can install
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
storage behind the meter
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
the commission has felt like they don't
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
have clear authority to allow it in its
 
01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
part net metering as part of net
 
01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:06.950 align:start position:0%
part net metering as part of net
metering

01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
metering
 
01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.070 align:start position:0%
metering
um

01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
so there is not really a recognition of
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
it as to how it can and should work um
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
on the distribution grid but having been
 
01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
very involved with liberty utilities
 
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
battery pilot docket and supporting that
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
um liberty kind of
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know is using the same sort of value
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
proposition that i've described here
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
which is to say can we dispatch storage
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
um at a few hours per month to try to
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
target this uh peak hour of demand and
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
reduce that demand and thus produce
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
reduction in transmission cost
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
as well as capacity cost um because the
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
capacity in in the energy market for
 
01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
capacity market is based on the annual
 
01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
system peak and it is reduced by storage
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
or distributed generation uh that serves
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
as a load reducer
 
01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:03.350 align:start position:0%
as a load reducer
so

01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
that you know liberty was able to
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
justify that in a regulatory setting but
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
we don't have the same mechanism in
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
place for customers to do this on their
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
own if you will
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
under some
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
some structure
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
that does regulate it but allows the
 
01:43:25.590 --> 01:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
realization of the value of of that kind
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
of load reduction so i think that is
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
sort of the urgency to this combined
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
with the fact that every year we see
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
more and more variable renewable
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
generation on the system and storage
 
01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
becomes increasingly important to help
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
balance that supply and demand in real
 
01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:42.470 align:start position:0%
balance that supply and demand in real
time

01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
so that that's sort of a long answer to
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
a short question thank you mr chairman
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and as a follow-up
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
question i would ask on uh section four
 
01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
you've also cement uh mentioned some
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
possible amendments that are necessary
 
01:44:00.639 --> 01:44:01.830 align:start position:0%
possible amendments that are necessary
to

01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
make that section of the bill
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
as useful as it can be
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
is it also true that uh
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
this legislation is necessary now to
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
allow projects to move forward
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
well two things if if you took this out
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
if you took part four out of the bill
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
and either or if you retain the bill
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh then you would be prohibited from
 
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:30.790 align:start position:0%
uh then you would be prohibited from
uh

01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
in a committee report or a drafting
 
01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:34.390 align:start position:0%
in a committee report or a drafting
exercise

01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
from bringing part four forward
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh because of um house rule i think it's
 
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.510 align:start position:0%
uh because of um house rule i think it's
36e

01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
36e
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
that prohibits the same language or
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
substantially the same language as being
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
considered in the second year of the
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
session if it was itl buy the house in
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
the first year of the session and i
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
think because you've
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
already itl two similar bills you might
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
be prohibited from uh bringing this back
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
um next year um however that rule
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to considering a senate
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
bill in the same session year as you may
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
have i t yelled it on a house bill
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
and so that's why i'm hoping you will
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
try to take the time to see if we can't
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
find some broader bipartisan agreement
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
that might enable it to move forward
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
and also just in terms of planning even
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
once it's going to take some period of
 
01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
time to actually work out the details
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
the puc may need to do some rule making
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
or department of energy maybe uh rule
 
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
making on this
 
01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.870 align:start position:0%
making on this
um

01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:37.669 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:37.679 --> 01:45:39.270 align:start position:0%
and
so

01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
to be blunt my concern is without
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
something like this that people can see
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
on the horizon here's an alternative to
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
develop some of these larger projects
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
we're just going to see after the next
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
election another big push to expand that
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
metering to five megawatts and my
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
concern is there's cross subsidies in
 
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
both directions under current net
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
metering terms um you know the large
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
projects over 100 kw get no credit for
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
reducing transmission cost even if they
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
do that but on the other hand so so
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's a you know a subsidy in one
 
01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
direction that benefits other customers
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh but in in the direction of the
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
generator they're getting i think
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
overcompensated at the full retail price
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
you know we need to unravel that and not
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
you know what happened in maine after
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
after they limited uh net metering for a
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
long time there was the legislature
 
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
changed and they did a huge expansion
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
and now they're facing huge numbers of
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
projects in the one to five megawatt
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
range that
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
are perhaps
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
being overcompensated to put it bluntly
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
um if there was a bilateral deal on some
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
of those projects the terms might be
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
better for rate payers and
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
and now they're also looking at the big
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
question of are they created new
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
stranded costs that are being subsidized
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
i think we want to try to avoid that
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you for that
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
clarification representative mcgee is
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you mr
 
01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:05.350 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you mr
chair

01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
um this was an excellent though
 
01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:09.109 align:start position:0%
um this was an excellent though
voluminous

01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
voluminous
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
explanation but i think
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
what i heard you saying boiled down on
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
item one of this omnibus bill
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
is that sort of the last frontier
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
for us to address is figuring out that
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
sweet spot between one and five
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
megawatts of energy contributions that
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
are happening within the state and how
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
to value them appropriately and that
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
that section basically gives the public
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
gives them the reins to go look at that
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
and try and figure out how we do that
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
properly in order to assess the value of
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
storage capability within the state
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
for the value that it contributes is
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
that an accurate way of looking at what
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
you said
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
it is it is and i simply know that for a
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
long time
 
01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
people even lawyers in the energy field
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
have often said well ferc and in iceland
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
new england have exclusive jurisdiction
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
over wholesale electricity sales
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's simply not true they have
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
exclusive jurisdiction over interstate
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
wholesale sales states have exclusive
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
over intro within states at wholesale
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
sales and if we don't create a framework
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
for it we're essentially saying you
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
can't do it and you have to
 
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
you have to you can only go up to the
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
iso new england level which isn't
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily the most beneficial for our
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
rate payers or those
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
local development opportunities
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and follow up mr chair
 
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
yep and the second thing that i
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
just heard you say was about the state
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
of maine and about
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
our continuing pursuit of trying to
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
how to just raise net metering caps as
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
as a way to address
 
01:48:50.639 --> 01:48:52.070 align:start position:0%
as a way to address
um

01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
that sweet spot between one and five
 
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
megawatts and you're saying that that
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
may not be the holy grail that we think
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
it is and that we by
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
by taking a further look through the
 
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission at how we
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
should be handling these
 
01:49:07.119 --> 01:49:08.629 align:start position:0%
should be handling these
interstate

01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
interstate
 
01:49:08.639 --> 01:49:09.510 align:start position:0%
interstate
um

01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
editions of distributed energy
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
and storage we might be able to come up
 
01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
with a more
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable and market-based solution
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
exactly yes oh good good i'm glad
 
01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
because you said so much and i was
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
put it in context thank you
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
thanks very much
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
 
01:49:30.719 --> 01:49:35.510 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
question

01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
before i start am i close enough so you
 
01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
can hear me
 
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes i can hear you okay uh thank you for
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
pointing out that sections one and four
 
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
need some work are you willing to
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh provide uh
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
input to make to make those sections
 
01:49:52.629 --> 01:49:52.639 align:start position:0%
better than they currently are
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
yes very much so whatever time it takes
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
okay secondly uh thank you for
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there are cross
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
subsidies on the net metering as it
 
01:50:01.199 --> 01:50:02.229 align:start position:0%
subsidies on the net metering as it
exists

01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
exists
 
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
can we work together to try to eliminate
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
those cross subsidies going forward yes
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
i would like to do that very much
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
because because in the long run i don't
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative oxendine
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative oxenom you're recognizing
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
yes i'm here but i'm trying to
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know again
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
process what was just said which opens
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
up an enormous ball of wax and i think
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
what i need to do is set that aside and
 
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
continue with my first question
 
01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:42.870 align:start position:0%
continue with my first question
um

01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr bilo for your
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
continued willingness to to work with
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
our committee
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
i want to question your statement that
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
you don't or at least the implication of
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
your statement
 
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
that you don't think the energy storage
 
01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
section needs
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
that there's any urgency here we've been
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
there there
 
01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
this issue has been pushed back and
 
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
pushed back uh we have a puc docket
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
which is coming to resolution and in
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
fact part of the language that's
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
incorporated by the senate in this has
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
taken the the very good information that
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
has been brought forward in that
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
proceeding and says
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
let's take this out of the hands of the
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
puc as it were if if this is in
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
indeed policy setting
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that this is in fact what the
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to see happen and and
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that that we do have agreement
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
here by the senate and the house that
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
this is the way to proceed that we do
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
need the clarity
 
01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:47.750 align:start position:0%
need the clarity
that

01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
moving to rules making without a
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
subsequent period for writing reports
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
and getting back and reporting
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
that this is a real opportunity to do
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
something that is vitally important for
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
moving our
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
grid mod forward and getting the value
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
proposition recognized we're not going
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
to have developers producing
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
coming into the state investing creating
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
jobs if we don't have clear rules and
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
procedures for them to follow so i i'd
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
like to just question you on that issue
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
do you not see this as a sense
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
of urgency
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
i i completely agree that there's an
 
01:52:32.229 --> 01:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
urgency to moving forward this um so i i
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
only just was acknowledging the factual
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
reality that it's always an option to
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
retain a bill and and
 
01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
study it some more
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
but i think in this case a lot of work
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
has gone into part one of the bill and
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
whatever issues remain i would hope
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
could be resolved in the next month
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
before the committee has to report the
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
bill and move it forward
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative callie pitts
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
still muted
 
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
i think rod was before me i'm just
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:25.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:27.270 align:start position:0%

feminism
 
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman vos and it wouldn't
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
have mattered to me
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh who went first
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
getting getting on this timeline thing
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
my question to you uh
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
mr bilo is
 
01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:43.750 align:start position:0%
mr bilo is
um

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
if this went to
 
01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
like a subcommittee
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
to work out these details do you feel
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
that we have a very good chance of
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
getting this uh
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
under the wire
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
and out of committee before
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
i believe so um i know
 
01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
that my own utility i believe liberty is
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
is comfortable with with the current
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
language i know eversource has some
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
concerns i i think there's you know
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
after experience with 315 there there's
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
a newfound willingness to realize that
 
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
we can find common ground if we just
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
simply understand each other's concerns
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit better
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
so that would be my hope that we can we
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
can think this through and get everybody
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
 
01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:38.709 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
pitts

01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
pitts
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
cliff i was going to ask is is it do you
 
01:54:43.589 --> 01:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
believe it's possible since these were
 
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
four different bills
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
parts of these bills
 
01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
do not require
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of work and other sections do
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
do you believe it's possible to retain
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
pieces of this bill or do we have to
 
01:54:58.800 --> 01:54:59.990 align:start position:0%
pieces of this bill or do we have to
retain

01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
the whole bill and then create a new
 
01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
bill for the next
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
next session
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
um i i i
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
that's a i think this idea of omnibus
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
bills from the senate is is relatively
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
new so yeah
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
i think you're asking something that's
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
maybe never been answered before
 
01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:19.109 align:start position:0%
maybe never been answered before
um

01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
it does seem
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
so i don't know the answer to it i don't
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
know whether you can retain it seems
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
like it's just strikes me as an all or
 
01:55:29.189 --> 01:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
nothing either retain the whole bill
 
01:55:29.199 --> 01:55:30.310 align:start position:0%
nothing either retain the whole bill
or

01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
pass it with amendment
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
um and or stick amendments on other
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
related bills i don't know
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.679 --> 01:55:43.750 align:start position:0%

03:01:00.790 --> 03:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
it was an accident
 
03:01:04.950 --> 03:01:04.960 align:start position:0%

about the possibility of
 
03:02:18.550 --> 03:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
moving forward on the builds this sp 91
 
03:02:19.750 --> 03:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
is it
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%

you know off and and leave this up in
 
03:02:27.349 --> 03:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
the air if time is of the essence
 
03:02:29.349 --> 03:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
should we be discussing the possibility
 
03:02:35.269 --> 03:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:37.510 --> 03:02:37.520 align:start position:0%

session on this bill
 
03:02:42.710 --> 03:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
and at that time if we determined we
 
03:02:44.550 --> 03:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
need a separate committee we can form
 
03:02:48.469 --> 03:02:48.479 align:start position:0%

03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%

be informed um as to who would be
 
03:02:58.230 --> 03:02:58.240 align:start position:0%

and then if we decide we need a
subcommittee

03:03:05.110 --> 03:03:05.120 align:start position:0%

03:03:44.150 --> 03:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
just be providing a little bit more
 
03:03:46.469 --> 03:03:46.479 align:start position:0%
information about what i i put in that
 
03:03:46.479 --> 03:03:48.550 align:start position:0%
information about what i i put in that
outline

03:03:48.550 --> 03:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
outline
 
03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:49.910 align:start position:0%
outline
so

03:03:49.910 --> 03:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to cover today my
 
03:03:53.269 --> 03:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
understanding of the type of information
 
03:03:56.389 --> 03:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
you're looking for is
 
03:03:58.630 --> 03:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit about what it takes to be
 
03:04:01.110 --> 03:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
able to finance a new renewable energy
 
03:04:01.120 --> 03:04:02.710 align:start position:0%
able to finance a new renewable energy
project

03:04:02.710 --> 03:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:04:05.510 --> 03:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
specific to the new hampshire context
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
so i'll cover some pretty broad
 
03:04:08.950 --> 03:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
information and then
 
03:04:11.750 --> 03:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
dan clapp who works at revision energy
 
03:04:13.349 --> 03:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
who is a co-founder of revision energy
 
03:04:15.349 --> 03:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
can go into a little bit more detail
 
03:04:18.230 --> 03:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
for example i also won't cover um
 
03:04:20.630 --> 03:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
federal policy the investment tax credit
 
03:04:22.389 --> 03:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
the itc
 
03:04:24.230 --> 03:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
on the federal side is very important to
 
03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
financing some renewable energy projects
 
03:04:28.469 --> 03:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
but i'll leave that probably to dan or
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
jeff to talk about
 
03:04:30.479 --> 03:04:31.429 align:start position:0%
jeff to talk about
so

03:04:31.429 --> 03:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:04:33.910 --> 03:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
first and foremost
 
03:04:36.070 --> 03:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
broad context i do want to mention that
 
03:04:38.710 --> 03:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has more conservative
 
03:04:41.910 --> 03:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
incentive and attributes less value
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
and has lower goals for renewable energy
 
03:04:46.870 --> 03:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
than all other new england states so
 
03:04:48.469 --> 03:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
when i'm talking to renewable energy
 
03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
developers were often a standout in that
 
03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:53.910 align:start position:0%
developers were often a standout in that
aspect

03:04:53.910 --> 03:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
03:04:55.990 --> 03:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
also when i talk to our business members
 
03:04:58.309 --> 03:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
who are renewable energy developers
 
03:04:58.319 --> 03:04:59.429 align:start position:0%
who are renewable energy developers
they

03:04:59.429 --> 03:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:05:02.070 --> 03:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
really focus on
 
03:05:05.950 --> 03:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
policy stability and consistency and
 
03:05:05.960 --> 03:05:07.510 align:start position:0%
policy stability and consistency and
predictability

03:05:07.510 --> 03:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
predictability
 
03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
as a need
 
03:05:10.870 --> 03:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
something that they need and are looking
 
03:05:14.389 --> 03:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
for to be able to finance new projects
 
03:05:16.630 --> 03:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
um so this morning for example when we
 
03:05:19.030 --> 03:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
talk about senate bill 78 the
 
03:05:20.950 --> 03:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
consistency in the re-bid and grant
 
03:05:23.349 --> 03:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
programs that's something that they're
 
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
03:05:27.590 --> 03:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about grandfathering
 
03:05:29.830 --> 03:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
the adder for low moderate income
 
03:05:31.990 --> 03:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
community solar projects that's
 
03:05:33.670 --> 03:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
something they're looking for it's that
 
03:05:35.670 --> 03:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
type of
 
03:05:37.830 --> 03:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
policy consistency predictability
 
03:05:37.840 --> 03:05:40.389 align:start position:0%
policy consistency predictability
durability

03:05:40.389 --> 03:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
durability
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
for example
 
03:05:43.510 --> 03:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is challenging in
 
03:05:45.830 --> 03:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
financing renewable energy projects is
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
that our net metering credit is tied to
 
03:05:49.830 --> 03:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
the default service rate
 
03:05:52.870 --> 03:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
which changes every six months or every
 
03:05:54.870 --> 03:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
month depending on what type of customer
 
03:05:56.070 --> 03:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
you are
 
03:05:57.990 --> 03:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
so that makes it difficult when you're
 
03:06:00.070 --> 03:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
potentially financing
 
03:06:03.670 --> 03:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
a project that's going to last 20 25 30
 
03:06:03.680 --> 03:06:05.110 align:start position:0%
a project that's going to last 20 25 30
years

03:06:05.110 --> 03:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:06:07.269 --> 03:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to model out what your
 
03:06:09.429 --> 03:06:09.439 align:start position:0%
revenue stream might be or what your
 
03:06:11.910 --> 03:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
payback on investment might be
 
03:06:13.830 --> 03:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
not knowing what the default energy
 
03:06:15.910 --> 03:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
service rate will be
 
03:06:21.590 --> 03:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:24.150 --> 03:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
so i'll go over a little bit on
 
03:06:25.670 --> 03:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
obviously when you're trying to develop
 
03:06:27.349 --> 03:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
a renewable energy project these are
 
03:06:29.429 --> 03:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
businesses nobody is developing
 
03:06:30.870 --> 03:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
renewable energy out of the goodness of
 
03:06:33.030 --> 03:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
their heart so they are looking for
 
03:06:35.429 --> 03:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
projects that make economic sense
 
03:06:37.110 --> 03:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
so that means either a reasonable
 
03:06:39.590 --> 03:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
payback on investment or something that
 
03:06:43.510 --> 03:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
will generate net revenue
 
03:06:45.830 --> 03:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
to understand that we have to understand
 
03:06:47.349 --> 03:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
what are the revenue streams for
 
03:06:49.510 --> 03:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects and what types
 
03:06:52.070 --> 03:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
of revenue streams are available to what
 
03:06:54.070 --> 03:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
types of projects
 
03:06:55.830 --> 03:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
we at clean energy new hampshire
 
03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
advocate for all types of renewable
 
03:07:00.150 --> 03:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
energy so i'm going to try to speak
 
03:07:02.950 --> 03:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
broadly about all renewable energy and
 
03:07:05.670 --> 03:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
at all scales so obviously it is very
 
03:07:07.269 --> 03:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
different situation if you're putting a
 
03:07:09.910 --> 03:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
few solar panels on a residential roof
 
03:07:11.910 --> 03:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
or if you're building a utility scale
 
03:07:13.670 --> 03:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
renewable energy project
 
03:07:15.910 --> 03:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
but i'll try and speak broadly
 
03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
for all those technologies and all those
 
03:07:19.990 --> 03:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
types of projects
 
03:07:22.309 --> 03:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
so as far as revenue streams
 
03:07:24.790 --> 03:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
there are three broad categories
 
03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:25.830 align:start position:0%
there are three broad categories
energy

03:07:25.830 --> 03:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:07:25.840 --> 03:07:27.110 align:start position:0%
energy
capacity

03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
03:07:28.389 --> 03:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
and what's called the environmental
 
03:07:31.110 --> 03:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
attributes which are documented
 
03:07:33.590 --> 03:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
as renewable energy certificates or
 
03:07:33.600 --> 03:07:35.349 align:start position:0%
as renewable energy certificates or
wrecks

03:07:35.349 --> 03:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
03:07:38.070 --> 03:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
for energy there's i would say three
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
broad categories of potential
 
03:07:43.750 --> 03:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
of where you may be getting your revenue
 
03:07:45.429 --> 03:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
for energy
 
03:07:46.870 --> 03:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects can
 
03:07:48.389 --> 03:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
participate in the iso new england
 
03:07:50.230 --> 03:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
wholesale markets
 
03:07:52.630 --> 03:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
and they may either get day ahead
 
03:07:55.750 --> 03:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
pricing or real-time pricing
 
03:07:58.150 --> 03:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:08:00.150 --> 03:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
it may not be as easy as it seems
 
03:08:01.830 --> 03:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
however to participate in the wholesale
 
03:08:01.840 --> 03:08:02.870 align:start position:0%
however to participate in the wholesale
market

03:08:02.870 --> 03:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
market
 
03:08:05.429 --> 03:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
it can be costly and require
 
03:08:07.510 --> 03:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
considerable expertise
 
03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
and therefore is not likely appropriate
 
03:08:13.510 --> 03:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
for very small generators
 
03:08:14.870 --> 03:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
some recent
 
03:08:17.590 --> 03:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
example of wholesale prices
 
03:08:19.349 --> 03:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
ice in new england reports the monthly
 
03:08:19.359 --> 03:08:21.110 align:start position:0%
ice in new england reports the monthly
average

03:08:21.110 --> 03:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
average
 
03:08:23.349 --> 03:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
november was two and a half cents that's
 
03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
pretty um
 
03:08:27.670 --> 03:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative of the last year
 
03:08:29.670 --> 03:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
recently in the winter the prices have
 
03:08:30.870 --> 03:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
gone up
 
03:08:33.590 --> 03:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
these prices uh
 
03:08:33.600 --> 03:08:35.269 align:start position:0%
these prices uh
4.4

03:08:35.269 --> 03:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
4.4
 
03:08:37.590 --> 03:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
and then in february 7.2 cents that's
 
03:08:40.230 --> 03:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
really high so in the two to three cents
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour is more representative
 
03:08:46.710 --> 03:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
of the average of of wholesale prices
 
03:08:48.630 --> 03:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
another broad category of where you may
 
03:08:50.150 --> 03:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
get your revenue
 
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
for energy as a renewable energy project
 
03:08:56.230 --> 03:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
is from contracts so here in new
 
03:08:58.230 --> 03:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire currently we're seeing
 
03:09:00.790 --> 03:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
um quite a bit of interest in developing
 
03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
larger scale renewable energy projects
 
03:09:06.469 --> 03:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
which in many cases have won bids in the
 
03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
clean energy procurements of other
 
03:09:08.080 --> 03:09:09.269 align:start position:0%
clean energy procurements of other
states

03:09:09.269 --> 03:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:09:11.349 --> 03:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
so that gives those developers a
 
03:09:13.830 --> 03:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts at a negotiated
 
03:09:13.840 --> 03:09:15.349 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts at a negotiated
price

03:09:15.349 --> 03:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
price
 
03:09:17.110 --> 03:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
and that gives them the certainty and
 
03:09:19.349 --> 03:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
stability to be able to finance those
 
03:09:19.359 --> 03:09:20.710 align:start position:0%
stability to be able to finance those
projects

03:09:20.710 --> 03:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
projects
 
03:09:23.670 --> 03:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
that may be energy only or it may be
 
03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
energy and wrecks depending on the
 
03:09:27.830 --> 03:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
details of the procurement and the
 
03:09:30.870 --> 03:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
details of the contract
 
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
another option for contracts includes
 
03:09:35.190 --> 03:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
power purchase agreements or corporate
 
03:09:35.200 --> 03:09:38.230 align:start position:0%
power purchase agreements or corporate
procurements

03:09:38.230 --> 03:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:38.240 --> 03:09:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
however

03:09:39.670 --> 03:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:09:41.590 --> 03:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
some of the details there still has to
 
03:09:43.590 --> 03:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
be a mechanism to make those
 
03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
transactions a reality
 
03:09:45.840 --> 03:09:46.790 align:start position:0%
transactions a reality
so

03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases it is challenging to
 
03:09:52.230 --> 03:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
03:09:54.710 --> 03:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
actually effectuate such transactions i
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
talk to people all the time that say
 
03:09:59.269 --> 03:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
i've got some land could i just put some
 
03:10:01.750 --> 03:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
solar on here and sell it to a business
 
03:10:03.190 --> 03:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
down the street
 
03:10:06.070 --> 03:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
that would be great however it is very
 
03:10:08.389 --> 03:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
challenging to actually figure out the
 
03:10:11.349 --> 03:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
mechanisms of those transactions
 
03:10:14.389 --> 03:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
and so that's why in many cases
 
03:10:16.230 --> 03:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
something like group net metering is
 
03:10:19.030 --> 03:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
necessary to be able to effectuate those
 
03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:20.469 align:start position:0%
necessary to be able to effectuate those
transactions

03:10:20.469 --> 03:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
03:10:22.550 --> 03:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
so i hear all the time for example that
 
03:10:23.830 --> 03:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
03:10:26.309 --> 03:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
the limitation to one megawatt doesn't
 
03:10:28.550 --> 03:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
prevent anyone from building
 
03:10:30.870 --> 03:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
a two megawatt solar array if they want
 
03:10:32.550 --> 03:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
and that is correct
 
03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
however the
 
03:10:37.750 --> 03:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
the regulatory mechanism to effectuate
 
03:10:39.750 --> 03:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
transactions between a generator and a
 
03:10:39.760 --> 03:10:40.790 align:start position:0%
transactions between a generator and a
buyer

03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
buyer
 
03:10:42.870 --> 03:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
is one of the things that groupnet
 
03:10:44.469 --> 03:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
metering allows
 
03:10:45.830 --> 03:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
really necessary and currently the
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
easiest most user-friendly way of
 
03:10:54.630 --> 03:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
facilitating some of those transactions
 
03:10:57.030 --> 03:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
for the credit from the generator to go
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
to the group members
 
03:11:01.349 --> 03:11:01.359 align:start position:0%
so the other way
 
03:11:04.710 --> 03:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
to get revenue for energy generated is
 
03:11:06.950 --> 03:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
03:11:09.429 --> 03:11:09.439 align:start position:0%
net metering is not
 
03:11:11.830 --> 03:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
getting money for selling electricity to
 
03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
the grid
 
03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:14.070 align:start position:0%
the grid
i

03:11:14.070 --> 03:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:11:16.469 --> 03:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that you cannot just
 
03:11:19.349 --> 03:11:19.359 align:start position:0%
act as a generator if you are a net
 
03:11:22.389 --> 03:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
metering host or a customer generator
 
03:11:25.750 --> 03:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
and get paid to act as a generator
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
the primary purpose of net metering is
 
03:11:30.630 --> 03:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
03:11:33.349 --> 03:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
to net out behind the meter usage from
 
03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
your bill
 
03:11:37.830 --> 03:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
and then as regular net metering you are
 
03:11:40.550 --> 03:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
also allowed to get credit on your bill
 
03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
for energy exported in excess
 
03:11:45.030 --> 03:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
of what you're consuming behind the
 
03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:46.550 align:start position:0%
of what you're consuming behind the
meter

03:11:46.550 --> 03:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
meter
 
03:11:49.269 --> 03:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
those credits can again get used on your
 
03:11:51.670 --> 03:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
against your bill in a different billing
 
03:11:51.680 --> 03:11:53.830 align:start position:0%
against your bill in a different billing
cycle

03:11:53.830 --> 03:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
under group net metering
 
03:11:57.670 --> 03:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
the credits generated by the host
 
03:11:59.990 --> 03:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
account or the generator
 
03:12:03.269 --> 03:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
can be attributed or shared with member
 
03:12:03.279 --> 03:12:04.630 align:start position:0%
can be attributed or shared with member
accounts

03:12:04.630 --> 03:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
03:12:07.670 --> 03:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
which there has to be a full group or
 
03:12:07.680 --> 03:12:08.950 align:start position:0%
which there has to be a full group or
contract

03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
contract
 
03:12:11.030 --> 03:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
between the host and the members
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
and all of the electricity generated by
 
03:12:14.710 --> 03:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
the host
 
03:12:16.630 --> 03:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
accounted for by the members so the
 
03:12:21.670 --> 03:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
member's total energy usage
 
03:12:24.550 --> 03:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
has to be equal or greater than the host
 
03:12:24.560 --> 03:12:29.349 align:start position:0%
has to be equal or greater than the host
generation

03:12:29.349 --> 03:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:30.630 --> 03:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
03:12:33.190 --> 03:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
revenue options for electricity or
 
03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
energy generation
 
03:12:37.590 --> 03:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
capacity payments
 
03:12:39.429 --> 03:12:39.439 align:start position:0%
for renewable energy generators
 
03:12:41.590 --> 03:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
participating in the wholesale market
 
03:12:43.190 --> 03:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
they may bid into iso new england's
 
03:12:45.030 --> 03:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
forward capacity auction
 
03:12:48.389 --> 03:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
and receive monthly capacity payments
 
03:12:48.399 --> 03:12:49.110 align:start position:0%
and receive monthly capacity payments
so

03:12:49.110 --> 03:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:12:50.550 --> 03:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
if you are
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
doing net metering
 
03:12:54.389 --> 03:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
any kind of distributed generation you
 
03:12:55.910 --> 03:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
are not eligible
 
03:12:59.030 --> 03:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
to get capacity payments
 
03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
um so that's a revenue stream that's not
 
03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
available to you
 
03:13:06.389 --> 03:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
there are some exceptions to that
 
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
um sunrun for example was able to
 
03:13:09.600 --> 03:13:11.110 align:start position:0%
um sunrun for example was able to
aggregate

03:13:11.110 --> 03:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
aggregate
 
03:13:13.750 --> 03:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
solar paired with storage and bid that
 
03:13:15.910 --> 03:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
into the capacity auction i believe two
 
03:13:17.990 --> 03:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
03:13:19.230 --> 03:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
and ferc
 
03:13:19.240 --> 03:13:20.870 align:start position:0%
and ferc
order2222

03:13:20.870 --> 03:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
order2222
 
03:13:23.349 --> 03:13:23.359 align:start position:0%
aims to increase the access of
 
03:13:25.590 --> 03:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources to
 
03:13:28.550 --> 03:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
wholesale and capacity markets so that's
 
03:13:31.110 --> 03:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
something that both ferc and the isos
 
03:13:33.910 --> 03:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
are working on developing
 
03:13:36.309 --> 03:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
to increase the access of these types of
 
03:13:38.469 --> 03:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
technologies to both the wholesale and
 
03:13:42.070 --> 03:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:44.550 --> 03:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
so finally um i will mention that
 
03:13:46.790 --> 03:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's different compensation for
 
03:13:50.790 --> 03:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
capacity based on your projected
 
03:13:53.750 --> 03:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
generation your capacity factor
 
03:13:55.590 --> 03:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
03:13:58.229 --> 03:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
iso now has in place a pay for
 
03:14:00.389 --> 03:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
performance system which means that if
 
03:14:02.469 --> 03:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
they hit a critical peak
 
03:14:04.469 --> 03:14:04.479 align:start position:0%
and you have a capacity obligation and
 
03:14:06.550 --> 03:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
you do not generate
 
03:14:09.190 --> 03:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
to meet your capacity obligation there
 
03:14:11.830 --> 03:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
is a significant financial penalty
 
03:14:13.830 --> 03:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
and so for an intermittent resource
 
03:14:15.830 --> 03:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
there can be a risk there
 
03:14:18.150 --> 03:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
that um if you're not generating for
 
03:14:20.070 --> 03:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
whatever reason it's not just for
 
03:14:21.670 --> 03:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
intermittent resources really it's for
 
03:14:23.030 --> 03:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
any resource
 
03:14:24.950 --> 03:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
if you don't have enough fuel on site or
 
03:14:27.030 --> 03:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
you had an unplanned outage
 
03:14:27.910 --> 03:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong with your
 
03:14:30.309 --> 03:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
interconnection at the moment
 
03:14:33.110 --> 03:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
you then have a penalty to pay for not
 
03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
performing according to your capacity
 
03:14:35.120 --> 03:14:37.830 align:start position:0%
performing according to your capacity
obligation

03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:40.950 --> 03:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
finally uh the third category of revenue
 
03:14:43.670 --> 03:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
is the environmental attributes or the
 
03:14:46.309 --> 03:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates
 
03:14:49.030 --> 03:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
so rex can be sold and be a source of
 
03:14:51.030 --> 03:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
revenue for renewable energy system
 
03:14:53.830 --> 03:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
owners i do want to be clear
 
03:14:56.469 --> 03:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
that the wrecks are for the renewable
 
03:14:58.070 --> 03:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
energy system owner
 
03:14:59.750 --> 03:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
i have talked to some folks that
 
03:15:02.630 --> 03:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes have a misconception
 
03:15:05.990 --> 03:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
that the developer or the installer of
 
03:15:09.030 --> 03:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
these systems is who benefits from rex
 
03:15:10.950 --> 03:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
and that's not the case so if you have a
 
03:15:13.110 --> 03:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
residential solar system
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
the owner of the rex is the owner of the
 
03:15:17.670 --> 03:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
system not the business that insult
 
03:15:21.269 --> 03:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:22.710 --> 03:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
they can be
 
03:15:24.710 --> 03:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
rex can also be retired by the system
 
03:15:27.510 --> 03:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
owner if they wish to keep and claim the
 
03:15:30.630 --> 03:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
wrecks as the environmental attribute so
 
03:15:33.269 --> 03:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
this can be important for businesses
 
03:15:36.469 --> 03:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
or governmental bodies that have uh
 
03:15:39.429 --> 03:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
goals to achieve net neutra uh not net
 
03:15:39.439 --> 03:15:40.550 align:start position:0%
goals to achieve net neutra uh not net
neutrality

03:15:40.550 --> 03:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
neutrality
 
03:15:43.750 --> 03:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh net zero carbon emissions for example
 
03:15:45.349 --> 03:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
they might want to hold on to their
 
03:15:46.550 --> 03:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
wrecks to be able to claim the
 
03:15:47.750 --> 03:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes of their
 
03:15:47.760 --> 03:15:52.870 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes of their
systems

03:15:52.870 --> 03:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:55.670 --> 03:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
rec value can vary greatly
 
03:15:58.150 --> 03:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
according depending on supply and demand
 
03:16:00.309 --> 03:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
for those wrecks so
 
03:16:00.319 --> 03:16:01.190 align:start position:0%
for those wrecks so
rex

03:16:01.190 --> 03:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
rex
 
03:16:02.469 --> 03:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
is um
 
03:16:04.550 --> 03:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
the demand for rex is based on the
 
03:16:07.190 --> 03:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard obligation
 
03:16:09.750 --> 03:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
so all utilities and electricity
 
03:16:12.870 --> 03:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
suppliers have obligations to meet
 
03:16:14.550 --> 03:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
according to the renewable portfolio
 
03:16:17.349 --> 03:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
standard goals and so that dictates the
 
03:16:20.630 --> 03:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
demand the supply depends on
 
03:16:23.190 --> 03:16:23.200 align:start position:0%
how much how many projects are operating
 
03:16:26.389 --> 03:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
how much renewable energy was generated
 
03:16:29.429 --> 03:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:31.030 --> 03:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
03:16:33.750 --> 03:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
some projects can cross-qualify across
 
03:16:35.670 --> 03:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
multiple states
 
03:16:37.670 --> 03:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
so for example
 
03:16:39.429 --> 03:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
some of the biomass projects were
 
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
selling their wrecks into connecticut
 
03:16:42.870 --> 03:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
03:16:45.750 --> 03:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's the case anymore
 
03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
some of the hydro projects are cost can
 
03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
be cross-qualified in new hampshire and
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
massachusetts if they meet the strict
 
03:16:52.239 --> 03:16:53.830 align:start position:0%
massachusetts if they meet the strict
requirements

03:16:53.830 --> 03:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:16:55.510 --> 03:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
but there are
 
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
strict requirements so not all renewable
 
03:17:01.590 --> 03:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
energy projects in new hampshire
 
03:17:03.990 --> 03:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements to be rec eligible
 
03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
for example
 
03:17:08.550 --> 03:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
for hydro there's requirements on fish
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
passage for biomass there's very strict
 
03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:13.269 align:start position:0%
passage for biomass there's very strict
emission

03:17:13.269 --> 03:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
emission
 
03:17:13.279 --> 03:17:14.630 align:start position:0%
emission
standards

03:17:14.630 --> 03:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
standards
 
03:17:17.670 --> 03:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
so for all of the these categories in
 
03:17:19.510 --> 03:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
every state there are specific
 
03:17:21.830 --> 03:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
requirements to be rec eligible
 
03:17:23.750 --> 03:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
so just because you are a renewable
 
03:17:26.950 --> 03:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
energy facility of a specific technology
 
03:17:29.110 --> 03:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
you may not qualify
 
03:17:31.429 --> 03:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
03:17:34.150 --> 03:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
certify wrecks and market them
 
03:17:36.389 --> 03:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
so it is pretty complex to figure out
 
03:17:38.469 --> 03:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
the supply and demand especially when
 
03:17:40.309 --> 03:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
some of these are sold across state
 
03:17:43.110 --> 03:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
lines because a change in policy in a
 
03:17:45.110 --> 03:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
neighboring state for example
 
03:17:47.190 --> 03:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
may affect our wreck market here in new
 
03:17:47.200 --> 03:17:48.309 align:start position:0%
may affect our wreck market here in new
hampshire

03:17:48.309 --> 03:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
but in general
 
03:17:51.830 --> 03:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire wrecks have much lower
 
03:17:56.389 --> 03:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:58.309 --> 03:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
so some other
 
03:18:00.309 --> 03:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
important considerations for renewable
 
03:18:02.870 --> 03:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
energy generators
 
03:18:04.950 --> 03:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
we do have some grant and rebate
 
03:18:07.190 --> 03:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
programs here in new hampshire funded by
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund
 
03:18:11.429 --> 03:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
we discussed that this morning a little
 
03:18:14.550 --> 03:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
bit the renewable energy fund is funded
 
03:18:17.349 --> 03:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
from alternative compliance payments
 
03:18:19.190 --> 03:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
which means that if
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
an utility or supplier that has an
 
03:18:21.120 --> 03:18:22.550 align:start position:0%
an utility or supplier that has an
obligation

03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
03:18:24.550 --> 03:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
under the renewable portfolio standard
 
03:18:26.469 --> 03:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
cannot meet that obligation by
 
03:18:29.429 --> 03:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
purchasing rex or they decide not to
 
03:18:31.349 --> 03:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are wrecks available but
 
03:18:32.950 --> 03:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason they decide to just
 
03:18:34.710 --> 03:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
make a payment
 
03:18:36.950 --> 03:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
it also acts as a sealing price on the
 
03:18:39.030 --> 03:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
value of racks
 
03:18:40.950 --> 03:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
if alternative compliance payments are
 
03:18:43.030 --> 03:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
are made into the fund
 
03:18:43.040 --> 03:18:44.710 align:start position:0%
are made into the fund
those

03:18:44.710 --> 03:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:18:46.870 --> 03:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
monies are then used for grant and
 
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
rebate programs that are designed to
 
03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
increase the development and
 
03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
availability of wrecks
 
03:18:56.150 --> 03:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
so the idea is that if
 
03:18:58.229 --> 03:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
suppliers and utilities are making acp
 
03:19:00.389 --> 03:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
payments there's a lack of supply for
 
03:19:03.670 --> 03:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
rex in specific categories
 
03:19:06.229 --> 03:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
grant and rebates available especially
 
03:19:08.630 --> 03:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
for those specific categories
 
03:19:08.640 --> 03:19:09.429 align:start position:0%
for those specific categories
will

03:19:09.429 --> 03:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:19:12.630 --> 03:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
incent the development of more
 
03:19:15.590 --> 03:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
generation capacity for those types of
 
03:19:17.269 --> 03:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
technologies and racks
 
03:19:20.150 --> 03:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
and will increase the supply for
 
03:19:24.710 --> 03:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:26.309 --> 03:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
the funding
 
03:19:26.319 --> 03:19:27.030 align:start position:0%
the funding
in

03:19:27.030 --> 03:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:19:29.429 --> 03:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
past years has been very limited as i
 
03:19:31.269 --> 03:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned this morning
 
03:19:34.070 --> 03:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
the residential solar rebate program is
 
03:19:36.309 --> 03:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
out of money for this fiscal year
 
03:19:37.910 --> 03:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
that happened about halfway through the
 
03:19:37.920 --> 03:19:39.030 align:start position:0%
that happened about halfway through the
year

03:19:39.030 --> 03:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:19:42.389 --> 03:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
and as a result um there was a wait list
 
03:19:44.469 --> 03:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
and now they're not acc the puc is not
 
03:19:46.950 --> 03:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
accepting applications at all
 
03:19:50.070 --> 03:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
so the funding can also be very variable
 
03:19:52.389 --> 03:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
from year to year because it is based on
 
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
acp revenues
 
03:19:57.670 --> 03:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
another uh thing that's important to
 
03:19:59.590 --> 03:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
03:20:02.790 --> 03:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
projects is the ability to negotiate
 
03:20:06.950 --> 03:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
pilots or payment in lieu of taxes
 
03:20:08.950 --> 03:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
this is new hampshire people talk about
 
03:20:11.190 --> 03:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
property taxes a lot and i hear about
 
03:20:13.110 --> 03:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
property taxes a lot from renewable
 
03:20:14.710 --> 03:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
energy developers
 
03:20:16.950 --> 03:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
for some it is um
 
03:20:19.510 --> 03:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
their largest expense for for renewable
 
03:20:21.030 --> 03:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
energy projects
 
03:20:22.790 --> 03:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
and so it is something that is really
 
03:20:24.790 --> 03:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the host community so if
 
03:20:26.550 --> 03:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
you have a renewable energy project in
 
03:20:29.110 --> 03:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
your town it can
 
03:20:31.110 --> 03:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
represent significant new tax revenue
 
03:20:32.870 --> 03:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
for your community
 
03:20:34.950 --> 03:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
which can be beneficial but renewable
 
03:20:37.269 --> 03:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
energy projects do have the ability to
 
03:20:39.910 --> 03:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
negotiate payment in lieu of taxes which
 
03:20:42.070 --> 03:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
can be beneficial for both the developer
 
03:20:44.309 --> 03:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
and the town it gives them both the
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility to negotiate an agreement
 
03:20:49.830 --> 03:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
that both agree to and is beneficial for
 
03:20:49.840 --> 03:20:51.990 align:start position:0%
that both agree to and is beneficial for
both

03:20:51.990 --> 03:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
both
 
03:20:54.630 --> 03:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
interconnection policies and costs and
 
03:20:57.670 --> 03:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
grid modernization is something that is
 
03:20:59.830 --> 03:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
increasingly important and i think would
 
03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
be critically important to get ahead of
 
03:21:04.150 --> 03:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
03:21:05.670 --> 03:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
we've seen
 
03:21:08.150 --> 03:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
this become very difficult in states
 
03:21:09.910 --> 03:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
that are far ahead of us in the
 
03:21:11.910 --> 03:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
deployment of distributed energy
 
03:21:11.920 --> 03:21:13.269 align:start position:0%
deployment of distributed energy
resources

03:21:13.269 --> 03:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
resources
 
03:21:13.279 --> 03:21:14.150 align:start position:0%
resources
and

03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:16.630 --> 03:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
we've already seen some
 
03:21:19.349 --> 03:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
challenges in certain areas of the state
 
03:21:21.990 --> 03:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
so we constantly ask for
 
03:21:24.070 --> 03:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
moving forward with grid modernization
 
03:21:25.670 --> 03:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
which has been stalled at the commission
 
03:21:27.590 --> 03:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
for a really long time
 
03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
we think they would be extremely
 
03:21:30.790 --> 03:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
beneficial for
 
03:21:32.309 --> 03:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
more information to be available to
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
developers regarding the hosting
 
03:21:37.590 --> 03:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
capacity of the grid for example so that
 
03:21:38.790 --> 03:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
they may know
 
03:21:41.750 --> 03:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
where the grid can host more renewable
 
03:21:43.670 --> 03:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
energy without
 
03:21:45.910 --> 03:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
a hugely significant
 
03:21:47.590 --> 03:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
cost to interconnect
 
03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
because all costs to interconnect new
 
03:21:52.710 --> 03:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
projects to the grid
 
03:21:56.070 --> 03:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
are completely paid for by the developer
 
03:21:58.710 --> 03:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
or the system owner and sometimes that
 
03:22:01.030 --> 03:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
is at considerable expense
 
03:22:02.630 --> 03:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
and it
 
03:22:04.070 --> 03:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
takes away an expense that would have
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
been paid for by rate payers
 
03:22:10.389 --> 03:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
so it is very important to get ahead of
 
03:22:12.870 --> 03:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
consistent predictable fair
 
03:22:15.349 --> 03:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
interconnection policies
 
03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
costs that are manageable
 
03:22:20.070 --> 03:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
as well as looking at what is needed to
 
03:22:21.830 --> 03:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
modernize our grid
 
03:22:24.389 --> 03:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
to benefit customers and meet their
 
03:22:24.399 --> 03:22:26.550 align:start position:0%
to benefit customers and meet their
expectations

03:22:26.550 --> 03:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
expectations
 
03:22:28.309 --> 03:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
then i'll talk about
 
03:22:31.190 --> 03:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
permitting and soft costs
 
03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
again businesses want predictability
 
03:22:37.110 --> 03:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
and stability and consistency
 
03:22:39.510 --> 03:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
so there is increasing
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
move to potentially be more strict with
 
03:22:44.550 --> 03:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
the development of renewable energy
 
03:22:46.150 --> 03:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
we're watching very closely the
 
03:22:48.870 --> 03:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
development of permitting standards
 
03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
specific to large solar developments at
 
03:22:53.670 --> 03:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
03:22:56.070 --> 03:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
regarding stormwater one-off
 
03:22:57.750 --> 03:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
so we want to make sure that renewable
 
03:23:00.150 --> 03:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
energy development is treated fairly and
 
03:23:00.160 --> 03:23:01.030 align:start position:0%
energy development is treated fairly and
not

03:23:01.030 --> 03:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:23:04.389 --> 03:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
overly restrictively
 
03:23:07.190 --> 03:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
a field of solar panels is very
 
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
different than a parking lot and we want
 
03:23:13.429 --> 03:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure that any environmental
 
03:23:15.670 --> 03:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
impact or potential environmental impact
 
03:23:18.070 --> 03:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
is considered carefully
 
03:23:20.469 --> 03:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
and that we don't over regulate or
 
03:23:25.590 --> 03:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:27.429 --> 03:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
so these are all things that can affect
 
03:23:29.830 --> 03:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
the cost and the feasibility of
 
03:23:32.309 --> 03:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
developing a renewable energy project
 
03:23:34.550 --> 03:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
the permitting and soft costs can be can
 
03:23:36.950 --> 03:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
really add a lot the interconnection can
 
03:23:36.960 --> 03:23:38.229 align:start position:0%
really add a lot the interconnection can
completely

03:23:38.229 --> 03:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
completely
 
03:23:40.790 --> 03:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
tank the the economic viability of a
 
03:23:40.800 --> 03:23:43.110 align:start position:0%
tank the the economic viability of a
project

03:23:43.110 --> 03:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:23:44.309 --> 03:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
so finally i'm going to talk a little
 
03:23:46.710 --> 03:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
bit about upfront cost versus ongoing
 
03:23:46.720 --> 03:23:48.070 align:start position:0%
bit about upfront cost versus ongoing
costs

03:23:48.070 --> 03:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:23:49.830 --> 03:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
all renewable energy technologies are
 
03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
not the same and it can be really
 
03:23:53.750 --> 03:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
different to finance
 
03:23:56.469 --> 03:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
a solar project versus a different kind
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
of project so
 
03:24:03.670 --> 03:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
some projects like solar have a lot have
 
03:24:06.630 --> 03:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
almost entirely upfront capital costs
 
03:24:08.790 --> 03:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
so when you're building a solar project
 
03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
the upfront costs will be very large
 
03:24:14.389 --> 03:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
however once the project is built there
 
03:24:17.670 --> 03:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
is very little ongoing costs so there
 
03:24:19.269 --> 03:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
are property tax
 
03:24:22.469 --> 03:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
costs and there may be land lease costs
 
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
if the owner doesn't own the land
 
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
however there's not significant
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
labor there's minimal maintenance you
 
03:24:31.590 --> 03:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
might have to just
 
03:24:33.670 --> 03:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
mow the field twice a year things like
 
03:24:33.680 --> 03:24:35.349 align:start position:0%
mow the field twice a year things like
that

03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:24:38.389 --> 03:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
wind is similar to solar
 
03:24:40.229 --> 03:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
there's a more maintenance costs because
 
03:24:42.309 --> 03:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
you have moving parts
 
03:24:43.990 --> 03:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
hydro has
 
03:24:46.630 --> 03:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
very large upfront costs but it also has
 
03:24:48.870 --> 03:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
significant ongoing costs
 
03:24:50.870 --> 03:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
that include labor
 
03:24:53.349 --> 03:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
maintenance taxes
 
03:24:56.630 --> 03:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
as well as re-licensing and so
 
03:24:57.990 --> 03:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of our
 
03:24:59.670 --> 03:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
small hydro projects here in new
 
03:25:01.190 --> 03:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire are at the point where they're
 
03:25:03.670 --> 03:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
going through ferc relicensing
 
03:25:06.790 --> 03:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
and that is a very costly
 
03:25:08.550 --> 03:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
very long and difficult
 
03:25:08.560 --> 03:25:09.750 align:start position:0%
very long and difficult
process

03:25:09.750 --> 03:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to keep these pro these
 
03:25:14.070 --> 03:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
projects online and generating local
 
03:25:16.630 --> 03:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
renewable energy for us
 
03:25:16.640 --> 03:25:17.910 align:start position:0%
renewable energy for us
biomass

03:25:17.910 --> 03:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
biomass
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
also has significant upfront costs to
 
03:25:21.429 --> 03:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
develop the infrastructure
 
03:25:21.439 --> 03:25:22.389 align:start position:0%
develop the infrastructure
they

03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:25:25.429 --> 03:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
have ongoing costs including maintenance
 
03:25:28.550 --> 03:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
and labor but they also have fuel costs
 
03:25:30.229 --> 03:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
unlike those the other renewable
 
03:25:30.239 --> 03:25:31.429 align:start position:0%
unlike those the other renewable
technologies

03:25:31.429 --> 03:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
03:25:33.830 --> 03:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
solar wind and hydro don't have fuel
 
03:25:37.990 --> 03:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
costs whereas biomass does
 
03:25:40.870 --> 03:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
i did want to touch briefly on
 
03:25:44.070 --> 03:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
some examples for revenue stream or
 
03:25:46.710 --> 03:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
different approaches that other states
 
03:25:47.910 --> 03:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
have taken
 
03:25:50.229 --> 03:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
for renewable energy
 
03:25:51.750 --> 03:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
so i've mentioned a little bit clean
 
03:25:53.670 --> 03:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
energy procurements
 
03:25:55.830 --> 03:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
other new england states have done
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
what's called clean energy procurements
 
03:26:01.030 --> 03:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
where they ask their utilities to
 
03:26:03.349 --> 03:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
put out requests for proposals that meet
 
03:26:05.190 --> 03:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
certain criteria
 
03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
some of them as i mentioned are for
 
03:26:08.630 --> 03:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
energy alone some are for energy and
 
03:26:12.150 --> 03:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates together
 
03:26:15.190 --> 03:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
and some of them require other proposals
 
03:26:17.750 --> 03:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
to be part of the contracts
 
03:26:19.910 --> 03:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
recently with offshore wind some of them
 
03:26:22.950 --> 03:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
require a certain amount of
 
03:26:24.790 --> 03:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
promised or documented
 
03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
local economic development
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
so saying we are going to create this
 
03:26:30.790 --> 03:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
many jobs we're going to
 
03:26:33.030 --> 03:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
invest in your local port we're going to
 
03:26:35.030 --> 03:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
use your local port to develop these
 
03:26:37.110 --> 03:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
projects for example
 
03:26:40.309 --> 03:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
so there's been very competitive pricing
 
03:26:42.070 --> 03:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
in some of these renewable energy
 
03:26:44.309 --> 03:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
procurements recently
 
03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
maine was the most recent and
 
03:26:48.150 --> 03:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
they saw
 
03:26:51.349 --> 03:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
a mix of solar hydro and biomass bidding
 
03:26:53.590 --> 03:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
into that those contracts
 
03:26:56.229 --> 03:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
and um i believe the average price was
 
03:26:59.429 --> 03:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
around 3.9 cents a kilowatt hour
 
03:27:01.349 --> 03:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
so very competitive with the wholesale
 
03:27:04.630 --> 03:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
market as i as i had explained earlier
 
03:27:06.790 --> 03:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is now in its what's
 
03:27:08.070 --> 03:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
called what they call their smart
 
03:27:11.030 --> 03:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
program which is a declining block
 
03:27:13.030 --> 03:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
program with adders
 
03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
and so they have very aggressive
 
03:27:17.590 --> 03:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
renewable energy goals they are seeking
 
03:27:19.349 --> 03:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
certain um
 
03:27:21.429 --> 03:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
declining blocks so there's higher value
 
03:27:23.429 --> 03:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
for the first project for the initial
 
03:27:26.630 --> 03:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
projects and then as they satisfy a
 
03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
certain amount of bid in capacity
 
03:27:33.750 --> 03:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
the value goes down however they have
 
03:27:37.269 --> 03:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
a whole series of adders for different
 
03:27:39.030 --> 03:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
types of projects so i get asked all the
 
03:27:41.429 --> 03:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
time why massachusetts has solar on
 
03:27:43.670 --> 03:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
almost every capital and phil but we
 
03:27:46.070 --> 03:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
have only i believe one current one
 
03:27:48.150 --> 03:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
project in new hampshire like that
 
03:27:49.670 --> 03:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
and it's in part because massachusetts
 
03:27:49.680 --> 03:27:50.550 align:start position:0%
and it's in part because massachusetts
said

03:27:50.550 --> 03:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:27:53.269 --> 03:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
let's really use this type of land that
 
03:27:55.190 --> 03:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
can't be used for anything else
 
03:27:56.790 --> 03:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
where folks probably won't complain
 
03:27:59.110 --> 03:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
about siting a project on it
 
03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
and they really went and incentivized
 
03:28:04.070 --> 03:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
putting solar on capped landfills
 
03:28:07.030 --> 03:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
through these adders and so these are
 
03:28:07.040 --> 03:28:08.630 align:start position:0%
through these adders and so these are
their

03:28:08.630 --> 03:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:28:10.469 --> 03:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
their net metering credit for example is
 
03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
already way more generous than ours
 
03:28:15.590 --> 03:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
they're putting an adder on top of that
 
03:28:17.910 --> 03:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
additional value to really drive
 
03:28:20.309 --> 03:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
development in certain locations
 
03:28:22.389 --> 03:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
or for example to serve low moderate
 
03:28:22.399 --> 03:28:23.269 align:start position:0%
or for example to serve low moderate
income

03:28:23.269 --> 03:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
income
 
03:28:23.279 --> 03:28:24.950 align:start position:0%
income
customers

03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
customers
 
03:28:28.070 --> 03:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
or to put it over a parking lot
 
03:28:28.080 --> 03:28:29.190 align:start position:0%
or to put it over a parking lot
or

03:28:29.190 --> 03:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:28:31.190 --> 03:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
03:28:33.110 --> 03:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
so that's a different approach
 
03:28:35.190 --> 03:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
and then another approach is what's
 
03:28:37.349 --> 03:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
called a feed-in tariff which
 
03:28:39.190 --> 03:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
guarantees grid access
 
03:28:41.349 --> 03:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
it's a long-term contract and it's a set
 
03:28:41.359 --> 03:28:42.309 align:start position:0%
it's a long-term contract and it's a set
price

03:28:42.309 --> 03:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
price
 
03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
again that's what developers really love
 
03:28:46.630 --> 03:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
to see to be able to have the confidence
 
03:28:49.110 --> 03:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
to finance new projects
 
03:28:50.870 --> 03:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
vermont for example has had a feed in
 
03:28:53.349 --> 03:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
tariff for renewable energy
 
03:28:55.670 --> 03:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
and a lot of countries in europe have
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
used feed and tariffs to
 
03:29:00.550 --> 03:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
incentivize the development of renewable
 
03:29:00.560 --> 03:29:02.150 align:start position:0%
incentivize the development of renewable
energy

03:29:02.150 --> 03:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:29:04.309 --> 03:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of times it it sort of has that
 
03:29:07.349 --> 03:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
declining block approach where
 
03:29:10.229 --> 03:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
the tariff is more generous initially
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
and as you start to make progress
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
towards meeting the goals or the cost of
 
03:29:17.269 --> 03:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
the systems go down or whatever you can
 
03:29:17.279 --> 03:29:18.389 align:start position:0%
the systems go down or whatever you can
have

03:29:18.389 --> 03:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:29:22.229 --> 03:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
sort of a declining value over time
 
03:29:24.870 --> 03:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
so that is about what i
 
03:29:26.950 --> 03:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to cover with all of you but i'm
 
03:29:31.269 --> 03:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:35.030 --> 03:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that very uh thorough
 
03:29:37.510 --> 03:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
explanation of
 
03:29:41.110 --> 03:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
the realities of
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
financing for renewable energy projects
 
03:29:47.110 --> 03:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
i would like to call on representative
 
03:29:54.150 --> 03:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:57.030 --> 03:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
sorry about that um thank you archer and
 
03:30:02.469 --> 03:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:02.479 --> 03:30:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:30:03.910 --> 03:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:05.590 --> 03:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
i'm serious about two things in
 
03:30:08.229 --> 03:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
particular and maybe i'll ask for we
 
03:30:10.070 --> 03:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
can't hear you very well uh
 
03:30:12.550 --> 03:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
03:30:14.150 --> 03:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
well i'll tell you what let me turn my
 
03:30:16.870 --> 03:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
microphone up here a little bit is that
 
03:30:18.710 --> 03:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
much better much better
 
03:30:21.190 --> 03:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm i'm that's you know i have too
 
03:30:23.429 --> 03:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
many buttons in front of me here
 
03:30:23.439 --> 03:30:24.630 align:start position:0%
many buttons in front of me here
um

03:30:24.630 --> 03:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:27.429 --> 03:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
you were talking about um
 
03:30:29.030 --> 03:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
a penalty for non-performance and
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
supplying uh energy once some small
 
03:30:33.990 --> 03:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
providers uh
 
03:30:36.630 --> 03:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
now how is that levied and what happens
 
03:30:39.190 --> 03:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
to that penalty um
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
can you speak a little bit more about
 
03:30:42.229 --> 03:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
that i would love to know more about
 
03:30:42.239 --> 03:30:43.269 align:start position:0%
that i would love to know more about
that

03:30:43.269 --> 03:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:30:45.429 --> 03:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
another thing you were speaking of and i
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
and i this is again
 
03:30:47.520 --> 03:30:48.870 align:start position:0%
and i this is again
um

03:30:48.870 --> 03:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:51.030 --> 03:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about um
 
03:30:53.830 --> 03:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
retaining wrecks uh if you wanted to do
 
03:30:55.510 --> 03:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
that i understand that's a problem in
 
03:30:57.269 --> 03:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
doing that the way the current the way
 
03:30:59.750 --> 03:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's being currently uh
 
03:31:01.349 --> 03:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
wraps are being taken by the power
 
03:31:02.710 --> 03:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
industry i was wondering if you speak to
 
03:31:02.720 --> 03:31:03.990 align:start position:0%
industry i was wondering if you speak to
that

03:31:03.990 --> 03:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:31:06.309 --> 03:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
and lastly i don't really want to open
 
03:31:08.790 --> 03:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
this can of worms but of all the energy
 
03:31:11.030 --> 03:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
i did notice that we did not bring up
 
03:31:14.150 --> 03:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
the idea of nuclear energy um i
 
03:31:15.830 --> 03:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
understand there have been problems over
 
03:31:17.429 --> 03:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
the years with that i understand we're
 
03:31:19.349 --> 03:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
looking at different technology
 
03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh so not not to get deep into it but
 
03:31:23.190 --> 03:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
could just you know
 
03:31:26.550 --> 03:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
ten words or less why no nuclear
 
03:31:28.389 --> 03:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you
 
03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll actually start with the last
 
03:31:32.229 --> 03:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
question um so we don't consider nuclear
 
03:31:35.110 --> 03:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
energy to be renewable um because it
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
does require a fuel that is mined that
 
03:31:39.750 --> 03:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
is a limited resource
 
03:31:39.760 --> 03:31:41.990 align:start position:0%
is a limited resource
so

03:31:41.990 --> 03:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:44.550 --> 03:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
it certainly is clean it doesn't emit
 
03:31:47.590 --> 03:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
any carbon dioxide it's not you know
 
03:31:49.750 --> 03:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
putting out emissions into the air
 
03:31:49.760 --> 03:31:51.110 align:start position:0%
putting out emissions into the air
however

03:31:51.110 --> 03:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:31:52.550 --> 03:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
when we're focusing on renewable
 
03:31:55.030 --> 03:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
resources we don't consider nuclear to
 
03:31:56.870 --> 03:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
be renewable because you have to mine
 
03:31:58.469 --> 03:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
uranium or
 
03:32:01.030 --> 03:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know fuel and so that's why we don't
 
03:32:03.670 --> 03:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
lump it into the category of renewable
 
03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
regarding um
 
03:32:07.190 --> 03:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
the penalty for non-performance
 
03:32:09.269 --> 03:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
that is part of iso new england's
 
03:32:09.279 --> 03:32:11.190 align:start position:0%
that is part of iso new england's
capacity

03:32:11.190 --> 03:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
03:32:13.269 --> 03:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
auction and market
 
03:32:16.710 --> 03:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
and so if you have a capacity obligation
 
03:32:19.510 --> 03:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
so every year in february iso new
 
03:32:22.710 --> 03:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
england has a forward capacity auction
 
03:32:25.750 --> 03:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
looking three years into the future
 
03:32:27.510 --> 03:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
if you are a wholesale market
 
03:32:31.750 --> 03:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
participant and you decide to bid into
 
03:32:33.750 --> 03:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
the forward capacity market
 
03:32:36.469 --> 03:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
three years into the future
 
03:32:38.950 --> 03:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
you receive monthly capacity payments
 
03:32:40.630 --> 03:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
from icer new england
 
03:32:42.630 --> 03:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
which are paid for by customers through
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
your default energy service rate
 
03:32:46.000 --> 03:32:47.349 align:start position:0%
your default energy service rate
um

03:32:47.349 --> 03:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:49.110 --> 03:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
there was a concern
 
03:32:51.030 --> 03:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
when originally when there was a
 
03:32:52.630 --> 03:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
capacity market there was no penalty
 
03:32:53.910 --> 03:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
like this and so there was a concern
 
03:32:55.750 --> 03:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
that you're being paid
 
03:32:57.429 --> 03:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
to be available
 
03:32:59.429 --> 03:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
but if you were not in fact available
 
03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
and you didn't in fact generate when you
 
03:33:03.030 --> 03:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
were needed
 
03:33:04.710 --> 03:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
there was no penalty and so you're
 
03:33:07.030 --> 03:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
getting a payment for a service but if
 
03:33:08.070 --> 03:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
you did not
 
03:33:09.830 --> 03:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
render the service there was no
 
03:33:09.840 --> 03:33:11.030 align:start position:0%
render the service there was no
consequence

03:33:11.030 --> 03:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
consequence
 
03:33:13.110 --> 03:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
and so i so developed this pay for
 
03:33:14.950 --> 03:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
performance system
 
03:33:17.910 --> 03:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
where if you if they hit a critic
 
03:33:19.110 --> 03:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know when they
 
03:33:21.110 --> 03:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
they determine there's a critical peak
 
03:33:21.120 --> 03:33:22.309 align:start position:0%
they determine there's a critical peak
event

03:33:22.309 --> 03:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
event
 
03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
and you do not in fact generate the
 
03:33:27.269 --> 03:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
electricity you had bid into the
 
03:33:29.190 --> 03:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
capacity market at that
 
03:33:31.030 --> 03:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
three years ago
 
03:33:33.910 --> 03:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
then you would have a penalty and so um
 
03:33:35.910 --> 03:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
you i'm not sure exactly how the payment
 
03:33:38.309 --> 03:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
is made um you either make the payment
 
03:33:38.319 --> 03:33:39.110 align:start position:0%
is made um you either make the payment
or

03:33:39.110 --> 03:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:33:41.349 --> 03:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
they will i'm guessing not pay you your
 
03:33:44.070 --> 03:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
next capacity payment until um the
 
03:33:47.670 --> 03:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
penalty is is paid
 
03:33:47.680 --> 03:33:49.030 align:start position:0%
penalty is is paid
uh

03:33:49.030 --> 03:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:33:51.510 --> 03:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
and then the second question i'm
 
03:33:53.190 --> 03:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
failing to remember
 
03:33:55.670 --> 03:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh that's concerned about uh retaining
 
03:33:58.630 --> 03:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
wrecks oh yes um the way you phrase that
 
03:33:58.640 --> 03:33:59.590 align:start position:0%
wrecks oh yes um the way you phrase that
maybe

03:33:59.590 --> 03:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:34:02.309 --> 03:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
think that right now well as we i think
 
03:34:04.150 --> 03:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
we're all aware the uh our utility
 
03:34:05.590 --> 03:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
companies would come and take the
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
unclaimed unregistered wrecks yes it's
 
03:34:09.750 --> 03:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a sensitive point to some people
 
03:34:11.910 --> 03:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
i just want to speak to that yes so
 
03:34:14.870 --> 03:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
there is wreck sweeping in new hampshire
 
03:34:18.070 --> 03:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
and those are for unregistered racks and
 
03:34:20.790 --> 03:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the systems that
 
03:34:23.030 --> 03:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
their racks are being swept it is
 
03:34:24.790 --> 03:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes because they're older systems
 
03:34:26.309 --> 03:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
and they don't have
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
the right inverter to be able to
 
03:34:30.550 --> 03:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
register and confirm that they're
 
03:34:32.950 --> 03:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
generating racks or something like that
 
03:34:32.960 --> 03:34:33.750 align:start position:0%
generating racks or something like that
so

03:34:33.750 --> 03:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:33.760 --> 03:34:34.710 align:start position:0%
so
if

03:34:34.710 --> 03:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
somebody installs solar on your roof and
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
you're like great i have a solar system
 
03:34:41.110 --> 03:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
and you don't do anything
 
03:34:44.309 --> 03:34:44.319 align:start position:0%
to register to be eligible
 
03:34:48.870 --> 03:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
to either sell or retire your wrecks
 
03:34:50.710 --> 03:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
then those wrecks get
 
03:34:52.710 --> 03:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
credited for free at no cost to the
 
03:34:54.790 --> 03:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
utilities or suppliers
 
03:34:56.070 --> 03:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
according to the rec sweeping
 
03:34:56.080 --> 03:34:57.830 align:start position:0%
according to the rec sweeping
calculation

03:34:57.830 --> 03:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
03:35:00.150 --> 03:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
however if you go through the trouble of
 
03:35:02.710 --> 03:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
filing the paperwork and becoming
 
03:35:02.720 --> 03:35:03.830 align:start position:0%
filing the paperwork and becoming
eligible

03:35:03.830 --> 03:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
03:35:06.550 --> 03:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
to market your racks
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
you can sell them
 
03:35:10.870 --> 03:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
or you cannot sell them and keep them
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
and that's what's called retiring your
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
wrecks and so if you want to be able to
 
03:35:15.670 --> 03:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
claim the attribute the environmental
 
03:35:17.429 --> 03:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
attributes of your system
 
03:35:19.830 --> 03:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
like some especially this is
 
03:35:21.830 --> 03:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
mostly done by large corporations that
 
03:35:23.429 --> 03:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
have made you know if you want to be
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
able to put on your product made with
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
100 renewable energy and you have solar
 
03:35:29.429 --> 03:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
on your factory
 
03:35:31.110 --> 03:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
you can't at the same time be selling
 
03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
your racks and be able to make that
 
03:35:33.279 --> 03:35:34.309 align:start position:0%
your racks and be able to make that
claim

03:35:34.309 --> 03:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
claim
 
03:35:37.110 --> 03:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise the whoever bought your wrecks
 
03:35:41.190 --> 03:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:45.830 --> 03:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
yes go on concerning uh the
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
retaining wrecks is that a difficult
 
03:35:53.110 --> 03:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
um i understand there have been barriers
 
03:35:54.870 --> 03:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
in the past to actually registering your
 
03:35:56.469 --> 03:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
wrecks in order to sell them i
 
03:35:58.550 --> 03:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
understand it's easier now
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
but if you want to retain is that a
 
03:36:02.870 --> 03:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
fairly simple process
 
03:36:02.880 --> 03:36:03.830 align:start position:0%
fairly simple process
so

03:36:03.830 --> 03:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:06.309 --> 03:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
so as i mentioned a lot of the systems
 
03:36:08.469 --> 03:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
that their wrecks are being swept it is
 
03:36:11.110 --> 03:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
older systems so they just like
 
03:36:12.150 --> 03:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
everything else there's a lot of
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
requirements to be able to
 
03:36:17.349 --> 03:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
authenticate document and confirm that
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
your system is producing
 
03:36:21.830 --> 03:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
this much energy and therefore
 
03:36:24.389 --> 03:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
a rack was generated that can be
 
03:36:24.399 --> 03:36:25.750 align:start position:0%
a rack was generated that can be
marketed

03:36:25.750 --> 03:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
marketed
 
03:36:28.710 --> 03:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
and there are some systems that don't
 
03:36:28.720 --> 03:36:29.670 align:start position:0%
and there are some systems that don't
meet

03:36:29.670 --> 03:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
meet
 
03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
some of those technological requirements
 
03:36:32.790 --> 03:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
especially some of the older ones you
 
03:36:34.710 --> 03:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
have to have
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't know the details and dan
 
03:36:38.950 --> 03:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
clap later might be able to to answer
 
03:36:40.389 --> 03:36:40.399 align:start position:0%
those details but i know that some of
 
03:36:41.830 --> 03:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
the older solar systems that were
 
03:36:43.910 --> 03:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
installed a while ago they just don't
 
03:36:46.389 --> 03:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
have the right inverter for example to
 
03:36:48.790 --> 03:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
meet the standard to say oh
 
03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
now we can document that your
 
03:36:53.190 --> 03:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
your system generated this much energy
 
03:36:55.030 --> 03:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
and we can confirm it and document it
 
03:36:56.710 --> 03:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
and verify it
 
03:36:59.030 --> 03:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
so there are some technical barriers and
 
03:37:01.510 --> 03:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
so some system owners might not want to
 
03:37:03.750 --> 03:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
invest in an upgrade on their system to
 
03:37:05.910 --> 03:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
be able to meet those requirements
 
03:37:07.910 --> 03:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then there is just the typical
 
03:37:09.590 --> 03:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of bureaucracy around it
 
03:37:11.910 --> 03:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
right so it's a lot of paperwork it's a
 
03:37:13.830 --> 03:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
lot of documenting things everything has
 
03:37:16.710 --> 03:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
a cost your time has a cost and so some
 
03:37:18.229 --> 03:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
system owners don't just want to go
 
03:37:20.710 --> 03:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
through the the whole rigmarole of going
 
03:37:22.070 --> 03:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
through the
 
03:37:24.790 --> 03:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
trouble of registering
 
03:37:27.269 --> 03:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
and then there's also a lot of unknown a
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
lot of system owners think that they are
 
03:37:31.910 --> 03:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
effectively retiring their racks by
 
03:37:31.920 --> 03:37:33.429 align:start position:0%
effectively retiring their racks by
inaction

03:37:33.429 --> 03:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
inaction
 
03:37:36.150 --> 03:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
and don't know that rec sweeping exists
 
03:37:38.070 --> 03:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty obscure policy we do a lot
 
03:37:40.229 --> 03:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
to try and educate people about it but
 
03:37:42.469 --> 03:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
some system owners just don't know that
 
03:37:45.269 --> 03:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
if they do nothing their wrecks then get
 
03:37:47.429 --> 03:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
credited for free to a utility or a
 
03:37:47.439 --> 03:37:50.710 align:start position:0%
credited for free to a utility or a
supplier

03:37:50.710 --> 03:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:52.150 --> 03:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for that answer thank
 
03:37:54.070 --> 03:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
you chair
 
03:37:57.429 --> 03:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
rigmarole is that a technical term
 
03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
love it
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee is recognized
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you ms
 
03:38:06.469 --> 03:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
minnow for this enlightening testimony
 
03:38:07.750 --> 03:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's always good to hear it again and
 
03:38:09.510 --> 03:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
again and again so we can maybe get it
 
03:38:12.389 --> 03:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
down sometime my question um
 
03:38:14.710 --> 03:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
let's see i wrote it down here
 
03:38:14.720 --> 03:38:16.870 align:start position:0%
let's see i wrote it down here
um

03:38:16.870 --> 03:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:19.190 --> 03:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned with how our policies
 
03:38:21.110 --> 03:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
might be affecting
 
03:38:23.670 --> 03:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
um the market the health of the market
 
03:38:25.269 --> 03:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
the energy market the renewable energy
 
03:38:27.750 --> 03:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
market in new hampshire and so from your
 
03:38:30.070 --> 03:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
testimony it sounds like hydro
 
03:38:31.910 --> 03:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
might be having increased difficulty
 
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
staying in operation because of the
 
03:38:36.550 --> 03:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory and other hurdles that they
 
03:38:37.910 --> 03:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
have to
 
03:38:40.790 --> 03:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
abide in order to turn a profit as as a
 
03:38:40.800 --> 03:38:41.830 align:start position:0%
abide in order to turn a profit as as a
business

03:38:41.830 --> 03:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:38:42.950 --> 03:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:38:45.750 --> 03:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
i know that biomass plants based on
 
03:38:48.309 --> 03:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
recent policy also sort of went
 
03:38:49.750 --> 03:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
mothballed and then they just got
 
03:38:51.830 --> 03:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
acquired i think a whole bunch of them
 
03:38:54.389 --> 03:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
were bought up by a company in maine
 
03:38:56.070 --> 03:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
which means we don't have control of
 
03:38:57.830 --> 03:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
those assets anymore
 
03:39:00.070 --> 03:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:39:01.590 --> 03:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
the last thing i wrote down here was
 
03:39:01.600 --> 03:39:02.550 align:start position:0%
the last thing i wrote down here was
that

03:39:02.550 --> 03:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:39:04.630 --> 03:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that our solar policies
 
03:39:05.670 --> 03:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
are still
 
03:39:07.190 --> 03:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
not stable
 
03:39:09.030 --> 03:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
enough to be really desirable for
 
03:39:11.190 --> 03:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
companies that are looking to figure out
 
03:39:12.870 --> 03:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
what welcoming markets they want to
 
03:39:16.389 --> 03:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
participate in so it seems like we're
 
03:39:18.630 --> 03:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
we're there's a compound of factors here
 
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
that are going to affect the value of
 
03:39:22.389 --> 03:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
wrecks in new hampshire
 
03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
and i wondered if you could say
 
03:39:25.269 --> 03:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
something about
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
how the wreck market contributes to
 
03:39:31.269 --> 03:39:31.279 align:start position:0%
a healthy system
 
03:39:33.510 --> 03:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
or system that works for the people that
 
03:39:34.950 --> 03:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
are trying to operate in that space
 
03:39:37.030 --> 03:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
since you're explaining how
 
03:39:39.670 --> 03:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
the financial part of it works
 
03:39:43.110 --> 03:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so as i mentioned the rac system
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
rex can be one of the
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
03:39:49.030 --> 03:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
revenue streams for projects
 
03:39:51.429 --> 03:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:39:53.990 --> 03:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's also a policy statement from the
 
03:39:55.510 --> 03:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
state so wrecks are part of the
 
03:39:57.590 --> 03:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard
 
03:39:59.349 --> 03:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
currently new hampshire's goals for the
 
03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard is 25
 
03:40:04.229 --> 03:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
renewable energy by 2025. when you look
 
03:40:05.990 --> 03:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
at the other new england states they're
 
03:40:07.830 --> 03:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to 80
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to 100
 
03:40:11.670 --> 03:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
and so that is
 
03:40:15.269 --> 03:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
a you know a policy of the state saying
 
03:40:17.110 --> 03:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
we are going to be
 
03:40:20.229 --> 03:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
really going after
 
03:40:22.950 --> 03:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
welcoming these businesses to come
 
03:40:24.870 --> 03:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
develop renewable energy in our state
 
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
and we are going to
 
03:40:28.309 --> 03:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
provide a
 
03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
policy framework which is the renewable
 
03:40:31.910 --> 03:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard to make sure that
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
that happens
 
03:40:35.349 --> 03:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
03:40:37.269 --> 03:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
those alternative compliance payments
 
03:40:40.150 --> 03:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
acting as ceiling values for racks
 
03:40:40.160 --> 03:40:41.110 align:start position:0%
acting as ceiling values for racks
so

03:40:41.110 --> 03:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
for example a solar rack an s rack in
 
03:40:47.510 --> 03:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts has was worth
 
03:40:47.520 --> 03:40:49.190 align:start position:0%
massachusetts has was worth
200

03:40:49.190 --> 03:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
200
 
03:40:50.229 --> 03:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
a wreck
 
03:40:52.150 --> 03:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire in recent years
 
03:40:54.150 --> 03:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen values for our class two
 
03:40:57.429 --> 03:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
solar racks to be as low as two dollars
 
03:40:59.110 --> 03:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
or five dollars
 
03:41:00.550 --> 03:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about two orders of
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
magnitude less and so obviously
 
03:41:05.830 --> 03:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
the businesses are going to be going to
 
03:41:08.550 --> 03:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
massachusetts because developing a solar
 
03:41:09.750 --> 03:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
array there
 
03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be much more
 
03:41:11.760 --> 03:41:12.950 align:start position:0%
is going to be much more
inviting

03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
inviting
 
03:41:15.110 --> 03:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
then to do that here and that creates
 
03:41:17.510 --> 03:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
jobs that creates local investment as i
 
03:41:20.309 --> 03:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned that's property tax payments
 
03:41:22.150 --> 03:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's a lot of investment and yes
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
the other technologies i mentioned in
 
03:41:26.630 --> 03:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
part because sometimes i get asked
 
03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
a hydro project is existing
 
03:41:31.990 --> 03:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
why in the world does it need support
 
03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
right it's already there it's already
 
03:41:34.319 --> 03:41:35.190 align:start position:0%
right it's already there it's already
built

03:41:35.190 --> 03:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
built
 
03:41:37.110 --> 03:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
well there are ongoing costs there are
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
significant regulatory costs the the
 
03:41:42.870 --> 03:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
re-licensing going through re-licensing
 
03:41:42.880 --> 03:41:44.710 align:start position:0%
re-licensing going through re-licensing
is

03:41:44.710 --> 03:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:41:46.950 --> 03:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
can be millions of dollars right
 
03:41:48.950 --> 03:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
and then when you get through in order
 
03:41:50.550 --> 03:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
to get through re-licensing you have all
 
03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
sorts of new environmental standards to
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
meet and so it may require significant
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investment building a new
 
03:42:00.229 --> 03:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
fish ladder building a new downstream
 
03:42:02.070 --> 03:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
fish passage ladder you may have
 
03:42:03.910 --> 03:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions on your operations maybe
 
03:42:05.910 --> 03:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
you used to be able to peak and now you
 
03:42:08.870 --> 03:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
can only run run of river that reduces
 
03:42:11.190 --> 03:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
your generation capacity
 
03:42:12.469 --> 03:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
you may
 
03:42:14.630 --> 03:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
have to shut down at night when it rains
 
03:42:17.190 --> 03:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
a certain amount to let the eels go by
 
03:42:19.590 --> 03:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
that reduces your generation capacity
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of requirements like
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
that that can be put on a project
 
03:42:23.760 --> 03:42:24.469 align:start position:0%
that that can be put on a project
to

03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:42:26.389 --> 03:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
enable to negotiate to get through
 
03:42:29.349 --> 03:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
re-licensing and so that all impacts the
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
economics of a project it can also
 
03:42:33.510 --> 03:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
increase your labor cost
 
03:42:35.110 --> 03:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
depending on how you're told you have to
 
03:42:36.550 --> 03:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
operate to be able to continue to
 
03:42:39.830 --> 03:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
generate similarly with biomass you know
 
03:42:42.150 --> 03:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
fuel costs which are
 
03:42:45.030 --> 03:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
directly reinvested in the local economy
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
but that's something that other projects
 
03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
don't have they have more ongoing costs
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about all these
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
technologies to us it is critically
 
03:42:55.349 --> 03:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
important to have fuel diversity
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
whenever you're looking at planning an
 
03:42:58.710 --> 03:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
electric grid you don't want to put all
 
03:43:00.309 --> 03:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
your eggs in one basket
 
03:43:01.830 --> 03:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
whether that's
 
03:43:03.910 --> 03:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
one type of renewable energy
 
03:43:06.229 --> 03:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
or one type of fossil fuel energy or
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
nuclear or whatever it is fuel diversity
 
03:43:11.429 --> 03:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
is critically important to resilience
 
03:43:14.950 --> 03:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
and protecting against the volatility
 
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
of the fuel in one technology for
 
03:43:16.800 --> 03:43:18.630 align:start position:0%
of the fuel in one technology for
example

03:43:18.630 --> 03:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
example
 
03:43:20.790 --> 03:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you can i just have a quick
 
03:43:20.800 --> 03:43:23.990 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you can i just have a quick
follow-up

03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:26.469 --> 03:43:26.479 align:start position:0%
well you had to uh we have other people
 
03:43:29.269 --> 03:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
who would like to ask questions
 
03:43:32.309 --> 03:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
oh okay all right thanks representative
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:38.630 --> 03:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i've got two
 
03:43:40.630 --> 03:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
unrelated questions you mentioned other
 
03:43:42.790 --> 03:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
states with goals of 80 to 100 percent
 
03:43:44.950 --> 03:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
renewables what do you think the impact
 
03:43:46.309 --> 03:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
will be on the central island new
 
03:43:48.309 --> 03:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
england market but they reach goals like
 
03:43:48.319 --> 03:43:51.349 align:start position:0%
england market but they reach goals like
that

03:43:51.349 --> 03:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:53.189 --> 03:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
i mean i think we're all in a regional
 
03:43:56.710 --> 03:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
grid right so if those states especially
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
the states that have the most
 
03:44:00.389 --> 03:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
significant load like massachusetts
 
03:44:03.030 --> 03:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
reach their goal of of being
 
03:44:03.040 --> 03:44:04.469 align:start position:0%
reach their goal of of being
um

03:44:04.469 --> 03:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:07.030 --> 03:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
net zero or reaching 100 renewable
 
03:44:07.040 --> 03:44:07.990 align:start position:0%
net zero or reaching 100 renewable
energy

03:44:07.990 --> 03:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:44:11.750 --> 03:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh certainly it will significantly uh
 
03:44:14.150 --> 03:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of renewable energy
 
03:44:17.349 --> 03:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
in the iso new england grid
 
03:44:17.359 --> 03:44:18.710 align:start position:0%
in the iso new england grid
overall

03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
overall
 
03:44:21.429 --> 03:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh well i guess my question was really
 
03:44:23.110 --> 03:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
related to if they don't have no control
 
03:44:24.790 --> 03:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
over that renewable energy and they're
 
03:44:25.910 --> 03:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
relying on
 
03:44:28.469 --> 03:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
what is they call generation and it's
 
03:44:30.950 --> 03:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
becoming a vanish in a small part of
 
03:44:32.710 --> 03:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
the total supply what happens to the
 
03:44:35.189 --> 03:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
excellent market but that's maybe too
 
03:44:37.830 --> 03:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
complicated the question um do you mean
 
03:44:39.990 --> 03:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's outside of the wholesale market
 
03:44:40.000 --> 03:44:41.030 align:start position:0%
it's outside of the wholesale market
right

03:44:41.030 --> 03:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:44:41.040 --> 03:44:41.830 align:start position:0%
right
right

03:44:41.830 --> 03:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:44:44.070 --> 03:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
yes um that is a challenge i mean we
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
hear our friends at nepka regularly say
 
03:44:49.349 --> 03:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
that they really would like
 
03:44:49.359 --> 03:44:51.349 align:start position:0%
that they really would like
um

03:44:51.349 --> 03:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:52.870 --> 03:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
the renewable you know the renewable
 
03:44:55.110 --> 03:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
energy generation to be within the
 
03:44:56.790 --> 03:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
wholesale markets and some of these
 
03:44:59.110 --> 03:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
state procurements that are outside of
 
03:45:01.030 --> 03:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
the wholesale market is a challenge to
 
03:45:01.040 --> 03:45:01.990 align:start position:0%
the wholesale market is a challenge to
that

03:45:01.990 --> 03:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:45:05.189 --> 03:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
so there is has been many
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
calls on the isis the rtos
 
03:45:11.590 --> 03:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
to take into account more the states
 
03:45:13.910 --> 03:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
that make them up uh their renewable
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
energy goals
 
03:45:18.870 --> 03:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
and and their policies as they do system
 
03:45:20.630 --> 03:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
planning and so i think that's a
 
03:45:22.790 --> 03:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
regional dialogue that's going on um you
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
know the nesco states put out a
 
03:45:26.950 --> 03:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
statement recently some states have put
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
out very strong statements like
 
03:45:28.800 --> 03:45:29.910 align:start position:0%
out very strong statements like
connecticut

03:45:29.910 --> 03:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
03:45:31.990 --> 03:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
really urging iso new england to start
 
03:45:34.630 --> 03:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
to take their own state's policies into
 
03:45:34.640 --> 03:45:35.510 align:start position:0%
to take their own state's policies into
account

03:45:35.510 --> 03:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
account
 
03:45:37.510 --> 03:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
as they do their planning and their work
 
03:45:39.830 --> 03:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
and to figure out a way to be able to
 
03:45:42.150 --> 03:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
meet those states policies
 
03:45:42.160 --> 03:45:43.349 align:start position:0%
meet those states policies
within

03:45:43.349 --> 03:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
within
 
03:45:45.510 --> 03:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
within the the system and the wholesale
 
03:45:45.520 --> 03:45:47.269 align:start position:0%
within the the system and the wholesale
market

03:45:47.269 --> 03:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
market
 
03:45:49.189 --> 03:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
you also mentioned feed in garrison how
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
they're used in europe that includes
 
03:45:53.189 --> 03:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
germany at brazil yes what's been the
 
03:45:55.670 --> 03:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
impact on consumer electric prices in
 
03:45:58.389 --> 03:45:58.399 align:start position:0%
germany from feeding tariffs
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh i don't have exact data on current uh
 
03:46:02.950 --> 03:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
and historical
 
03:46:05.429 --> 03:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
prices in germany i'm sorry
 
03:46:07.830 --> 03:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
i do but i'm not supposed to testify
 
03:46:07.840 --> 03:46:09.349 align:start position:0%
i do but i'm not supposed to testify
okay

03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:46:11.590 --> 03:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative regina has
 
03:46:13.510 --> 03:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
recognized her question thank you mr
 
03:46:15.670 --> 03:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you miss minnow for
 
03:46:17.830 --> 03:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned that in
 
03:46:17.840 --> 03:46:19.189 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned that in
massachusetts

03:46:19.189 --> 03:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
03:46:21.110 --> 03:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
it provides incentives for installing
 
03:46:23.349 --> 03:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
solar panels on landfills
 
03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
are there extra costs or disincentive
 
03:46:27.590 --> 03:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
when installing solar panels on capped
 
03:46:27.600 --> 03:46:29.750 align:start position:0%
when installing solar panels on capped
landfills

03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
03:46:32.790 --> 03:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
yes so the adders are meant to
 
03:46:36.550 --> 03:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
compensate for extra costs so putting a
 
03:46:39.349 --> 03:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
solar system on a landfill landfills
 
03:46:41.189 --> 03:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
generally have a cap landfills have a
 
03:46:44.389 --> 03:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
membrane that's the same uh issue if
 
03:46:46.950 --> 03:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
you're putting a solar system on a
 
03:46:49.670 --> 03:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
former superfund site or landfill you're
 
03:46:51.910 --> 03:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
not able to
 
03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
penetrate the surface so typically when
 
03:46:56.229 --> 03:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
you do a ground mounted solar array you
 
03:46:58.150 --> 03:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
can drive piles
 
03:47:00.550 --> 03:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
so that the posts are into the ground
 
03:47:02.389 --> 03:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
you're not able to do that on a landfill
 
03:47:04.150 --> 03:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
because you would pierce the membrane
 
03:47:06.229 --> 03:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
and so there are added costs you usually
 
03:47:08.389 --> 03:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
have to do um
 
03:47:10.630 --> 03:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
ballasted systems so there's very large
 
03:47:12.710 --> 03:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
concrete blocks for example or other
 
03:47:14.710 --> 03:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
like a pipe filled with concrete that
 
03:47:17.510 --> 03:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
can hold the array onto the surface
 
03:47:20.469 --> 03:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
without digging into the ground or the
 
03:47:21.830 --> 03:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
the surface
 
03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
similarly folks ask me all the time why
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
there's not more solar over parking lots
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
it is more expensive to build a solar
 
03:47:29.910 --> 03:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
car port
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
than it is to build a regular ground
 
03:47:35.349 --> 03:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
mounted solar array and so in in order
 
03:47:37.189 --> 03:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
to encourage the development of these
 
03:47:39.670 --> 03:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
systems that are more costly but there
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
are benefits of putting a solar ray over
 
03:47:43.910 --> 03:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
a parking lot or on a capped landfill
 
03:47:43.920 --> 03:47:45.110 align:start position:0%
a parking lot or on a capped landfill
so

03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:48.309 --> 03:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
adders generally are needed to
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
compensate for the extra cost of those
 
03:47:50.399 --> 03:47:52.870 align:start position:0%
compensate for the extra cost of those
systems

03:47:52.870 --> 03:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
systems
 
03:47:56.790 --> 03:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:03.910 --> 03:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:06.710 --> 03:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman
 
03:48:09.429 --> 03:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
ms minnow um
 
03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that we are
 
03:48:15.110 --> 03:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
in a cycle actually it's probably been
 
03:48:16.309 --> 03:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
going on for
 
03:48:17.910 --> 03:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
eternity but
 
03:48:17.920 --> 03:48:19.910 align:start position:0%
eternity but
um

03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
where every uh change of
 
03:48:24.950 --> 03:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh administration
 
03:48:28.469 --> 03:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
where we where the majority changes from
 
03:48:30.550 --> 03:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
one party to the other
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
we go through a cycle of
 
03:48:35.990 --> 03:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
new legislation which reverses
 
03:48:39.590 --> 03:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
what the previous legislation
 
03:48:41.510 --> 03:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
legislator has done
 
03:48:41.520 --> 03:48:42.389 align:start position:0%
legislator has done
and

03:48:42.389 --> 03:48:42.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:48:44.630 --> 03:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
i mean you you talked about it a little
 
03:48:44.640 --> 03:48:46.070 align:start position:0%
i mean you you talked about it a little
bit

03:48:46.070 --> 03:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
bit
 
03:48:48.550 --> 03:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.030 --> 03:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
these long-term projects
 
03:48:52.710 --> 03:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
need long-term
 
03:48:52.720 --> 03:48:53.990 align:start position:0%
need long-term
stability

03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
stability
 
03:48:58.469 --> 03:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:01.830 --> 03:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
are we going to have a difficult time
 
03:49:03.910 --> 03:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
no matter what we do
 
03:49:03.920 --> 03:49:04.630 align:start position:0%
no matter what we do
to

03:49:04.630 --> 03:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:49:07.269 --> 03:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
to reverse that kind of mindset i mean
 
03:49:09.910 --> 03:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
are are people going to be looking or
 
03:49:11.830 --> 03:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
companies going to be looking at new
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire is not a good place to invest
 
03:49:17.670 --> 03:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
because of the cycling that
 
03:49:19.349 --> 03:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
is going on
 
03:49:21.750 --> 03:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
and i do have a follow-up on that as
 
03:49:21.760 --> 03:49:22.950 align:start position:0%
and i do have a follow-up on that as
well

03:49:22.950 --> 03:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:49:24.389 --> 03:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
so i can say this isn't unique to new
 
03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire right this happens everywhere
 
03:49:28.229 --> 03:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
in every state and at the federal level
 
03:49:30.309 --> 03:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
to have changes in administrations and
 
03:49:32.550 --> 03:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
changes in policies
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
yes when you're looking to finance a a
 
03:49:36.710 --> 03:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
project based on a certain policy you
 
03:49:38.150 --> 03:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that that policy is as
 
03:49:40.790 --> 03:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
stable and predictable as possible
 
03:49:42.550 --> 03:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
and so that's why
 
03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
when we work on certain policies as i
 
03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned we tried to put in
 
03:49:48.070 --> 03:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
grandfathering clause so that if you
 
03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
build a project based on a policy that's
 
03:49:52.469 --> 03:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
in effect at the time
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
it is extremely beneficial to say
 
03:49:57.189 --> 03:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
that if you go in service today and that
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
policy exists today
 
03:50:02.070 --> 03:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
you have that tariff guaranteed to you
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
for 20 years for example and that is
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
something that we always try to make
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
sure and explain why that's so important
 
03:50:10.469 --> 03:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
to have in a policy because
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
if we change our minds next year because
 
03:50:14.630 --> 03:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's a different administration we
 
03:50:16.389 --> 03:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
don't want that project that made a
 
03:50:19.750 --> 03:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
significant investment to then be
 
03:50:21.670 --> 03:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
have the rug pulled out from under them
 
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
so there are ways to craft policies to
 
03:50:25.510 --> 03:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's predictability
 
03:50:27.110 --> 03:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
and stability at least for the projects
 
03:50:28.309 --> 03:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
that get built
 
03:50:30.469 --> 03:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
while the policy is in effect of course
 
03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
if you change the policy
 
03:50:34.710 --> 03:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
future future projects won't be able to
 
03:50:36.469 --> 03:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
use that policy going forward but at
 
03:50:38.070 --> 03:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
least that the projects that made an
 
03:50:39.670 --> 03:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
investment based on that policy should
 
03:50:41.349 --> 03:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
have some amount of guarantee of
 
03:50:41.359 --> 03:50:42.870 align:start position:0%
have some amount of guarantee of
stability

03:50:42.870 --> 03:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
stability
 
03:50:42.880 --> 03:50:44.550 align:start position:0%
stability
um

03:50:44.550 --> 03:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'd say that's that's what's
 
03:50:47.910 --> 03:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
most important to us there's always
 
03:50:50.309 --> 03:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
going to be some changes in the future
 
03:50:52.469 --> 03:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
we clean energy i can say that when i
 
03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
try to you know
 
03:50:56.389 --> 03:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
really advocate for a policy i try to
 
03:50:58.630 --> 03:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
make sure it has bipartisan support
 
03:51:00.150 --> 03:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
it's really challenging to build those
 
03:51:03.110 --> 03:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
coalitions but that's a way to ensure
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
that if it's got some support from both
 
03:51:11.269 --> 03:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:13.590 --> 03:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up chairman
 
03:51:14.550 --> 03:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
03:51:14.560 --> 03:51:15.349 align:start position:0%
go ahead
okay

03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:51:17.910 --> 03:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and my follow-up is actually
 
03:51:17.920 --> 03:51:19.189 align:start position:0%
thank you and my follow-up is actually
concerns

03:51:19.189 --> 03:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
03:51:21.030 --> 03:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh a little bit about what you talked
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
about with uh
 
03:51:22.800 --> 03:51:23.590 align:start position:0%
about with uh
uh

03:51:23.590 --> 03:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:51:26.150 --> 03:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
solar arrays going above
 
03:51:26.160 --> 03:51:27.110 align:start position:0%
solar arrays going above
uh

03:51:27.110 --> 03:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:51:30.150 --> 03:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
parking lots and on landfills that that
 
03:51:33.269 --> 03:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
you you you basically killing two birds
 
03:51:36.790 --> 03:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
with one stone so to speak and one of
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
the things other things are t-rex
 
03:51:42.550 --> 03:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
how we're really killing multiple birds
 
03:51:45.750 --> 03:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
with the same stone and and
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
there has been discussion about
 
03:51:50.150 --> 03:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
eliminating t-rex
 
03:51:50.160 --> 03:51:51.269 align:start position:0%
eliminating t-rex
and

03:51:51.269 --> 03:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:51.279 --> 03:51:52.070 align:start position:0%
and
that

03:51:52.070 --> 03:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:51:54.550 --> 03:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
because it's thermal energy
 
03:51:56.550 --> 03:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
we should be taxing
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
03:52:03.189 --> 03:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
for instance oil or gas and not
 
03:52:06.229 --> 03:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
electricity in some way and i'm just
 
03:52:06.239 --> 03:52:07.910 align:start position:0%
electricity in some way and i'm just
wondering

03:52:07.910 --> 03:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
03:52:11.110 --> 03:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
um i mean i can sort of understand that
 
03:52:14.229 --> 03:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
but what is the feasibility of
 
03:52:15.910 --> 03:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
03:52:15.920 --> 03:52:18.309 align:start position:0%
doing that
and

03:52:18.309 --> 03:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:20.070 --> 03:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
not only that but
 
03:52:21.910 --> 03:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
how how are we going to deal with all
 
03:52:21.920 --> 03:52:22.790 align:start position:0%
how how are we going to deal with all
these

03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
other birds that we've killed with this
 
03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
t-rex stone whether it's uh you know
 
03:52:31.269 --> 03:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
keeping our forests healthy and
 
03:52:31.279 --> 03:52:32.870 align:start position:0%
keeping our forests healthy and
um

03:52:32.870 --> 03:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:34.469 --> 03:52:34.479 align:start position:0%
the many things that we're getting out
 
03:52:34.479 --> 03:52:35.349 align:start position:0%
the many things that we're getting out
of

03:52:35.349 --> 03:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:52:37.269 --> 03:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
these t-rexes
 
03:52:39.030 --> 03:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
we don't like to talk about dead birds
 
03:52:41.510 --> 03:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
and renewable energy we always
 
03:52:42.630 --> 03:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
get too many questions about wind
 
03:52:45.269 --> 03:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
turbines and birds dying so we won't
 
03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
talk about killing too many birds but um
 
03:52:49.189 --> 03:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're saying
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
certainly um i mean we have advocated
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
for the inclusion of thermal in in our
 
03:52:54.479 --> 03:52:55.510 align:start position:0%
for the inclusion of thermal in in our
energy

03:52:55.510 --> 03:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:52:57.910 --> 03:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
obviously if we're looking at
 
03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
economic development benefits which is
 
03:53:01.910 --> 03:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
primarily what we focus on
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
there is tremendous benefit to the state
 
03:53:04.800 --> 03:53:05.990 align:start position:0%
there is tremendous benefit to the state
to

03:53:05.990 --> 03:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:53:09.830 --> 03:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
to buy locally produced thermal fuel
 
03:53:12.150 --> 03:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
and use those technologies
 
03:53:12.160 --> 03:53:13.510 align:start position:0%
and use those technologies
with

03:53:13.510 --> 03:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:53:15.910 --> 03:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
with strict emission
 
03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
limits which are in place to be able to
 
03:53:19.510 --> 03:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
qualify for those thermal wrecks right
 
03:53:20.950 --> 03:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
there's an environmental benefit there
 
03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:53:24.469 --> 03:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
there's very little benefit to buying
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
heating oil for the economy of new
 
03:53:26.399 --> 03:53:27.510 align:start position:0%
heating oil for the economy of new
hampshire

03:53:27.510 --> 03:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know you're paying the guy that or
 
03:53:31.670 --> 03:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
the woman that's delivering it to you
 
03:53:33.910 --> 03:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
but that's about it other than that the
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
the money goes out of state so um
 
03:53:40.150 --> 03:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
the to us why the renewable portfolio
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
standard was put in place was for fuel
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
diversity and that applies not just to
 
03:53:48.150 --> 03:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
electricity it also applies to buildings
 
03:53:50.950 --> 03:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
economic benefits to the state
 
03:53:52.790 --> 03:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
and environmental benefits
 
03:53:56.070 --> 03:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
if we're serious about reducing
 
03:53:56.080 --> 03:53:58.309 align:start position:0%
if we're serious about reducing
emissions

03:53:58.309 --> 03:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
03:54:01.110 --> 03:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
then we should be tackling the heating
 
03:54:03.030 --> 03:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
sector and the building sector as well
 
03:54:05.590 --> 03:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
as the electricity sector
 
03:54:08.710 --> 03:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know some states have
 
03:54:08.720 --> 03:54:09.910 align:start position:0%
you know some states have
renewable

03:54:09.910 --> 03:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
renewable
 
03:54:12.469 --> 03:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
electricity standards and we are very
 
03:54:14.229 --> 03:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
proud here in new hampshire that we have
 
03:54:16.389 --> 03:54:16.399 align:start position:0%
a renewable energy standard because it
 
03:54:18.950 --> 03:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
is not just applying to electricity
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
um maine has recently done the same and
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
added thermal energy to their to their
 
03:54:25.590 --> 03:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard
 
03:54:26.630 --> 03:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
so i mean
 
03:54:29.030 --> 03:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
where the funding comes from
 
03:54:30.309 --> 03:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it would be a lot more
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
challenging to tax
 
03:54:35.429 --> 03:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
non-regulated fuels which is what a lot
 
03:54:40.870 --> 03:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:42.630 --> 03:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you next step is
 
03:54:48.790 --> 03:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:50.870 --> 03:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you uh
 
03:54:52.790 --> 03:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
miss minnow for coming and giving us
 
03:54:54.630 --> 03:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
this great presentation
 
03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
um i've got two questions i think
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
they're pretty simple for you to answer
 
03:55:01.750 --> 03:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
can you explain a little bit to everyone
 
03:55:01.760 --> 03:55:03.110 align:start position:0%
can you explain a little bit to everyone
um

03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:06.469 --> 03:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
what what is the forward capacity market
 
03:55:08.469 --> 03:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
so we all get the same
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
understanding and secondly can you tell
 
03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
me something about how does
 
03:55:16.389 --> 03:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
supply demand work with regard to the
 
03:55:18.630 --> 03:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
acp payments
 
03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
how are they connected
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
the alternative compliance payments yeah
 
03:55:25.110 --> 03:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
so the forward capacity
 
03:55:27.910 --> 03:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
market is as i mentioned it's an auction
 
03:55:30.309 --> 03:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
an annual auction that the grid operator
 
03:55:32.070 --> 03:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
is new england holds
 
03:55:34.550 --> 03:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
every year in february looking three
 
03:55:36.229 --> 03:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
years into the future
 
03:55:38.950 --> 03:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
and so they are looking to secure enough
 
03:55:41.429 --> 03:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
capacity to meet demand
 
03:55:43.750 --> 03:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
probably and then some so they also look
 
03:55:46.389 --> 03:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
to have a little bit of a cushion
 
03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
and that's the way that they make sure
 
03:55:48.800 --> 03:55:49.830 align:start position:0%
and that's the way that they make sure
that

03:55:49.830 --> 03:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:55:51.510 --> 03:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
three years into the future we are going
 
03:55:54.070 --> 03:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
to have enough generators online to be
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
able to meet demand no matter what
 
03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
and so generators will
 
03:56:01.990 --> 03:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
put a bid into the the capacity auction
 
03:56:04.630 --> 03:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
and say i offer up the availability of
 
03:56:07.750 --> 03:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
my capacity in three years
 
03:56:10.870 --> 03:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
for this much money and so
 
03:56:12.790 --> 03:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
there's right there iso is going to
 
03:56:14.950 --> 03:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
start say okay i'm going to take the
 
03:56:17.670 --> 03:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
the cheapest bids first and then they go
 
03:56:20.469 --> 03:56:20.479 align:start position:0%
up in value until they get to the amount
 
03:56:22.150 --> 03:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
of capacity they're looking to procure
 
03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
to meet all of the projected demand in
 
03:56:25.670 --> 03:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
three years
 
03:56:28.550 --> 03:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
once you have a capacity obligation
 
03:56:30.870 --> 03:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
you when that month comes up where your
 
03:56:32.469 --> 03:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
capacity obligation is
 
03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
you get your payment
 
03:56:35.750 --> 03:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
and so that payment
 
03:56:35.760 --> 03:56:36.710 align:start position:0%
and so that payment
says

03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:56:38.790 --> 03:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
we we are paying you for existing and
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
being available to generate
 
03:56:42.790 --> 03:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned now there's this pay
 
03:56:45.110 --> 03:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
for per for permit system
 
03:56:47.349 --> 03:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
you may not be generating
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know you're not being paid to
 
03:56:51.349 --> 03:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
actually generate electricity that's the
 
03:56:53.429 --> 03:56:53.439 align:start position:0%
separate revenue stream of electricity
 
03:56:56.070 --> 03:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
and energy production that i mentioned
 
03:56:57.990 --> 03:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
the capacity payment is paying you for
 
03:57:00.630 --> 03:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
being available to generate for existing
 
03:57:02.550 --> 03:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
and you could be on standby or you could
 
03:57:04.710 --> 03:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
be generating it depends you're really
 
03:57:08.469 --> 03:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
being paid for your availability
 
03:57:10.710 --> 03:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
and that is how the system operator
 
03:57:13.349 --> 03:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
plans ahead and makes sure that there
 
03:57:15.670 --> 03:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
will be enough generation available
 
03:57:17.030 --> 03:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
when it's needed
 
03:57:19.349 --> 03:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
so some plants for example that are
 
03:57:21.670 --> 03:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
peaker plants that don't generate very
 
03:57:21.680 --> 03:57:22.630 align:start position:0%
peaker plants that don't generate very
often

03:57:22.630 --> 03:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
often
 
03:57:24.870 --> 03:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
they are still economically viable
 
03:57:27.670 --> 03:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
because of these capacity payments
 
03:57:29.269 --> 03:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
that are really paying them to be
 
03:57:31.429 --> 03:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
available when needed only during those
 
03:57:33.510 --> 03:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
peak events
 
03:57:34.630 --> 03:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
acps and supply and demand of racks so
 
03:57:42.550 --> 03:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's demand of racks is dictated by
 
03:57:44.309 --> 03:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
the obligations
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
so we have four classes in the renewable
 
03:57:50.229 --> 03:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard class 1 which is
 
03:57:52.550 --> 03:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
a big bucket of new renewables the
 
03:57:55.269 --> 03:57:55.279 align:start position:0%
subclass of class 1 thermal
 
03:57:57.990 --> 03:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
class 2 which is solar class 3 which is
 
03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
biomass electric and class 4 which was
 
03:58:02.710 --> 03:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
existing small hydro
 
03:58:04.469 --> 03:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
so there are specific
 
03:58:06.550 --> 03:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
obligations that are equal to a
 
03:58:06.560 --> 03:58:07.750 align:start position:0%
obligations that are equal to a
percentage

03:58:07.750 --> 03:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
03:58:11.590 --> 03:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
of the entire load of new hampshire
 
03:58:14.389 --> 03:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
to meet those specific technologies and
 
03:58:14.399 --> 03:58:15.990 align:start position:0%
to meet those specific technologies and
so

03:58:15.990 --> 03:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:19.429 --> 03:58:19.439 align:start position:0%
every utility so the big utilities
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
03:58:22.710 --> 03:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers have these
 
03:58:25.030 --> 03:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
obligations proportional to the load
 
03:58:27.189 --> 03:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
that they serve
 
03:58:29.349 --> 03:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
and so they have a choice they can go
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
out to generators and say hey do you
 
03:58:33.750 --> 03:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
have any wrecks i can buy i'm looking
 
03:58:35.750 --> 03:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
for class 2 racks i'm looking for class
 
03:58:38.229 --> 03:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
3 rex
 
03:58:41.110 --> 03:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
there is also an acp value so for
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
example for
 
03:58:45.670 --> 03:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
class 1 rex it's 57
 
03:58:47.189 --> 03:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
a megawatt hour
 
03:58:49.030 --> 03:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
a megawatt hour is equivalent to one
 
03:58:49.040 --> 03:58:50.309 align:start position:0%
a megawatt hour is equivalent to one
rack

03:58:50.309 --> 03:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
rack
 
03:58:50.319 --> 03:58:51.030 align:start position:0%
rack
so

03:58:51.030 --> 03:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:53.429 --> 03:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
i always have the choice as say i'm a
 
03:58:56.309 --> 03:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
utility i say you got any class 1 racks
 
03:58:58.630 --> 03:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
i can buy i need to buy
 
03:59:00.550 --> 03:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
10 recs for example
 
03:59:02.550 --> 03:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
somebody will say oh sure i'll sell them
 
03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
to you for 60 dollars and i'll say no
 
03:59:05.040 --> 03:59:06.070 align:start position:0%
to you for 60 dollars and i'll say no
thanks

03:59:06.070 --> 03:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
03:59:07.590 --> 03:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
i'll go make an alternative compliance
 
03:59:09.189 --> 03:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
payment so that's how it acts as a
 
03:59:10.870 --> 03:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
ceiling price because you always have
 
03:59:12.309 --> 03:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
the option of making the alternative
 
03:59:14.550 --> 03:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
compliance payments but if i say you got
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
any class one recs i can buy and they
 
03:59:18.070 --> 03:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
say oh yeah sure here they are for uh
 
03:59:19.990 --> 03:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll sell them to you for fifty
 
03:59:21.429 --> 03:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
dollars each
 
03:59:23.590 --> 03:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
or i'll sell them to you for
 
03:59:26.150 --> 03:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
but maybe there's an over supply and so
 
03:59:27.750 --> 03:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
then maybe i get into a bidding war with
 
03:59:29.830 --> 03:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
some other generators and the utility
 
03:59:31.269 --> 03:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
ends up being able to buy them for just
 
03:59:33.030 --> 03:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
25 a wreck
 
03:59:35.750 --> 03:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
so that's how the supply also affects
 
03:59:37.030 --> 03:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
the value
 
03:59:41.030 --> 03:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
the acp value is the ceiling price so
 
03:59:42.469 --> 03:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
anyone with an obligation should never
 
03:59:44.150 --> 03:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
have to pay more than that
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
but typically there is more supply than
 
03:59:50.389 --> 03:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
there is demand and so the value of the
 
03:59:54.469 --> 03:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
racks is lower than the ceiling price
 
03:59:56.070 --> 03:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
and the more supply there is on the
 
03:59:56.080 --> 03:59:57.110 align:start position:0%
and the more supply there is on the
system

03:59:57.110 --> 03:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:59:59.670 --> 03:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
the more the sort of the better deal the
 
04:00:02.550 --> 04:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
obligations can get and so when we talk
 
04:00:04.550 --> 04:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
about if we increase our renewable
 
04:00:06.469 --> 04:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard goals
 
04:00:08.790 --> 04:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
what will the cost be
 
04:00:08.800 --> 04:00:09.670 align:start position:0%
what will the cost be
um

04:00:09.670 --> 04:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:11.750 --> 04:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of times the values that you may
 
04:00:14.070 --> 04:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
get are the worst case scenario which is
 
04:00:16.150 --> 04:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
assuming that every rack is selling at
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
the acp value at the ceiling price
 
04:00:21.670 --> 04:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
in reality that's unlikely typically the
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
wrecks are sold
 
04:00:27.750 --> 04:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:31.520 --> 04:00:32.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:00:36.229 --> 04:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
next up is representative callie pitts
 
04:00:37.510 --> 04:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:39.910 --> 04:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
i had two questions one thing
 
04:00:41.670 --> 04:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
and and the things i really don't
 
04:00:43.750 --> 04:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
understand as i listen to you talk about
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
the wrecks and i've been here 25 years
 
04:00:50.950 --> 04:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
and a adding payments adders and doing
 
04:00:53.349 --> 04:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
things to incentivize people
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
i understand that there's a climate
 
04:00:57.990 --> 04:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
problem but
 
04:01:00.630 --> 04:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
you get a grant and i'm talking about an
 
04:01:02.950 --> 04:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
individual now get a grant to build a
 
04:01:06.070 --> 04:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
home to build a system
 
04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
you net meter
 
04:01:09.670 --> 04:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
so you don't pay
 
04:01:12.070 --> 04:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
much of an electricity you pay for trans
 
04:01:13.830 --> 04:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution and what
 
04:01:15.110 --> 04:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
you don't use
 
04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
and then you get wrecks
 
04:01:17.439 --> 04:01:18.710 align:start position:0%
and then you get wrecks
that

04:01:18.710 --> 04:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:24.950 --> 04:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
why is there a problem
 
04:01:27.910 --> 04:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
getting people to do things
 
04:01:30.389 --> 04:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
when it seems to me like
 
04:01:32.389 --> 04:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
they're really making out
 
04:01:34.710 --> 04:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
and the other question
 
04:01:34.720 --> 04:01:36.229 align:start position:0%
and the other question
that

04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:38.469 --> 04:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
comes along is
 
04:01:41.349 --> 04:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
as a business a regular businesses
 
04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
customer base
 
04:01:43.439 --> 04:01:45.429 align:start position:0%
customer base
shrinks

04:01:45.429 --> 04:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
shrinks
 
04:01:47.990 --> 04:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to pick up the slack for
 
04:01:48.000 --> 04:01:49.429 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to pick up the slack for
that

04:01:49.429 --> 04:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:49.439 --> 04:01:51.670 align:start position:0%
that
and

04:01:51.670 --> 04:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:53.670 --> 04:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be the the customer
 
04:01:56.150 --> 04:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
who's not using that business it's going
 
04:01:58.950 --> 04:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
to be the customer who is utilizing the
 
04:02:01.590 --> 04:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
business so could you try to clarify
 
04:02:04.229 --> 04:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
those two because they are really
 
04:02:06.630 --> 04:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
they have baffled me over the years and
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
i i just
 
04:02:11.429 --> 04:02:11.439 align:start position:0%
sure i don't understand it
 
04:02:14.790 --> 04:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
so um say we're talking about dan clap
 
04:02:16.389 --> 04:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
can maybe talk about this in more
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
realistic detail but i'm going to use
 
04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
some rough numbers
 
04:02:21.110 --> 04:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
say you're want to put a solar array on
 
04:02:24.070 --> 04:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
a on a typical single family house
 
04:02:26.309 --> 04:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
um here in new hampshire you're like all
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
right um it's going to be like a 7
 
04:02:31.510 --> 04:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
kilowatt array i think is pretty typical
 
04:02:33.429 --> 04:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
that might cost you
 
04:02:35.830 --> 04:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
25 000
 
04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
so you go to the puc you say hey here
 
04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's a rebate program funded from the
 
04:02:41.910 --> 04:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund can i get a rebate
 
04:02:43.830 --> 04:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
there if it's available like right now
 
04:02:45.510 --> 04:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
they would say nope sorry we're all out
 
04:02:47.590 --> 04:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
of money for this year if it's available
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
they're gonna say sure you get one
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so that lowers
 
04:02:53.830 --> 04:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
your cost from twenty five thousand to
 
04:02:55.750 --> 04:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
twenty four
 
04:02:55.760 --> 04:02:57.110 align:start position:0%
twenty four
um

04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:59.349 --> 04:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
then you apply for net metering um
 
04:03:01.750 --> 04:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully there's not a significant cost
 
04:03:03.510 --> 04:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
to interconnect your system right
 
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
eversource could say
 
04:03:06.229 --> 04:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have to replace the
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
transformer on the pole in your
 
04:03:09.030 --> 04:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhood to be able to interconnect
 
04:03:11.670 --> 04:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
your system that could make the system
 
04:03:13.750 --> 04:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
prohibitively expensive so hopefully
 
04:03:15.510 --> 04:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's no significant cost so you get
 
04:03:17.670 --> 04:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
to interconnect you get net metering
 
04:03:19.830 --> 04:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
you used to pay um
 
04:03:22.870 --> 04:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
all-in cost of say 18 to 20 cents a
 
04:03:24.710 --> 04:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour when we're talking about
 
04:03:24.720 --> 04:03:25.990 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour when we're talking about
everything

04:03:25.990 --> 04:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:03:27.429 --> 04:03:27.439 align:start position:0%
in your bill
 
04:03:29.830 --> 04:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
um the net metering credit for a small
 
04:03:32.550 --> 04:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
array is closer to
 
04:03:35.590 --> 04:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
12 to 13 cents a kilowatt hour i think
 
04:03:38.790 --> 04:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
if you're cons so it's electricity 25
 
04:03:41.910 --> 04:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
of distribution transmission
 
04:03:44.070 --> 04:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
so you're still always paying your
 
04:03:46.469 --> 04:03:46.479 align:start position:0%
customer charge your non-bypassable
 
04:03:46.479 --> 04:03:47.750 align:start position:0%
customer charge your non-bypassable
charges

04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
charges
 
04:03:51.189 --> 04:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
and 75 of the distribution system
 
04:03:52.950 --> 04:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
so you're still not
 
04:03:53.830 --> 04:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:03:56.309 --> 04:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
paying nothing you're paying the the
 
04:03:57.590 --> 04:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
commission determined that that's you're
 
04:03:59.670 --> 04:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
paying your fair share of the grid
 
04:04:01.830 --> 04:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
so you're not you know getting off
 
04:04:04.309 --> 04:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
scot-free so with all of that you're
 
04:04:07.670 --> 04:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
still looking at a significant payback
 
04:04:09.590 --> 04:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
period for your system
 
04:04:11.910 --> 04:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
that with the one thousand dollar rebate
 
04:04:13.189 --> 04:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
you're paying twenty four thousand
 
04:04:13.199 --> 04:04:14.309 align:start position:0%
you're paying twenty four thousand
dollars

04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
so even though your bill will be reduced
 
04:04:18.630 --> 04:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
with the net metering being able to net
 
04:04:21.110 --> 04:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
out your behind the meter usage
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
if you
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
exported more in august you're really
 
04:04:27.830 --> 04:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
just using that credit when your array
 
04:04:30.150 --> 04:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
produces less in winter months for
 
04:04:30.160 --> 04:04:31.590 align:start position:0%
produces less in winter months for
example

04:04:31.590 --> 04:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:04:34.229 --> 04:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
so you're still likely not zeroing out
 
04:04:36.150 --> 04:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
your electric bill
 
04:04:36.160 --> 04:04:37.269 align:start position:0%
your electric bill
and

04:04:37.269 --> 04:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:04:39.030 --> 04:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
you still have significant cost to pay
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
back so it's still a pretty big barrier
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
for folks there's financing available
 
04:04:46.150 --> 04:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
there are also federal
 
04:04:48.630 --> 04:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
tax incentives if you have the tax
 
04:04:50.229 --> 04:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
burden to be able to realize those
 
04:04:50.239 --> 04:04:51.510 align:start position:0%
burden to be able to realize those
incentives

04:04:51.510 --> 04:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
incentives
 
04:04:55.670 --> 04:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:55.680 --> 04:04:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
may i follow up mr chair yes
 
04:05:04.229 --> 04:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know where you are um would
 
04:05:07.510 --> 04:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
and the payback on that average system
 
04:05:10.150 --> 04:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
just average and the average usage what
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
they figure out
 
04:05:13.110 --> 04:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:05:16.630 --> 04:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
what about 10 years
 
04:05:18.469 --> 04:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
04:05:20.309 --> 04:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
i think so yeah about
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
i think eight to ten years
 
04:05:23.429 --> 04:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
and the system
 
04:05:25.110 --> 04:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
lasts 20 years
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
25 yeah
 
04:05:31.030 --> 04:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you okay next up is representative
 
04:05:33.920 --> 04:05:38.150 align:start position:0%
thank you okay next up is representative
sausage

04:05:38.150 --> 04:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:40.070 --> 04:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
sorry mr chairman i forgot to take down
 
04:05:43.510 --> 04:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:44.790 --> 04:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
04:05:44.800 --> 04:05:47.349 align:start position:0%
oh okay
um

04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
well i guess we're all done with
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions here then so i guess uh we can
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank ms minnow for an excellent
 
04:05:52.880 --> 04:05:54.469 align:start position:0%
thank ms minnow for an excellent
presentation

04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
04:05:56.070 --> 04:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'll stick around if
 
04:05:58.389 --> 04:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
anybody if any other questions specific
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
to me pop up after um dan and jeff speak
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay that sounds good
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
dan clapp i believe from
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
thanks representative revision energy
 
04:06:24.550 --> 04:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
revision energy okay yeah where is yours
 
04:06:26.790 --> 04:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:06:28.630 --> 04:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
i'm joining late here just got off
 
04:06:31.349 --> 04:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
another meeting so i
 
04:06:33.349 --> 04:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
don't want to i'm sure madeline did a
 
04:06:35.349 --> 04:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
wonderful job covering
 
04:06:39.189 --> 04:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
the state of um the solar market and
 
04:06:41.189 --> 04:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
financing in new hampshire so
 
04:06:43.429 --> 04:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
maybe i'll just quickly introduce myself
 
04:06:46.389 --> 04:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
the company the markets we serve
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
and then open it up for for questions um
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
yeah revision energy we're an
 
04:06:54.550 --> 04:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
employee-owned b corp we have locations
 
04:06:56.950 --> 04:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
in brentwood new hampshire
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
in enfield new hampshire so the upper
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
valley and the seacoast
 
04:07:02.309 --> 04:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
we've been operating in new hampshire
 
04:07:04.389 --> 04:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
since 2008
 
04:07:06.389 --> 04:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
we also have locations in maine and
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
massachusetts as well
 
04:07:11.110 --> 04:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
um but we serve both the residential
 
04:07:13.750 --> 04:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
market and the commercial market and
 
04:07:15.189 --> 04:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
when i say the commercial market i'm
 
04:07:17.110 --> 04:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
gonna break it down into two different
 
04:07:19.030 --> 04:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
buckets one is on-site
 
04:07:19.040 --> 04:07:20.229 align:start position:0%
buckets one is on-site
commercial

04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's a small business
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
rooftop ground mount or quote-unquote
 
04:07:26.710 --> 04:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
behind the meter when you build an array
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's service servicing load behind the
 
04:07:31.510 --> 04:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
meter and then also off-site solar so
 
04:07:33.750 --> 04:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
when you start to build some larger
 
04:07:37.189 --> 04:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
multi-megawatt systems um off-site
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
and that gets into group net metering et
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
cetera and we we build most of those in
 
04:07:44.070 --> 04:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
maine in in massachusetts not not new
 
04:07:44.080 --> 04:07:45.349 align:start position:0%
maine in in massachusetts not not new
hampshire

04:07:45.349 --> 04:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
at this point just because maybe what
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
madeline touched upon some of the
 
04:07:51.349 --> 04:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
economics but what it what it comes down
 
04:07:52.950 --> 04:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
to is
 
04:07:55.030 --> 04:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
you have your build costs or what they
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
refer to as epc
 
04:07:58.469 --> 04:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
engineering procurement construction
 
04:07:58.479 --> 04:07:59.429 align:start position:0%
engineering procurement construction
costs

04:07:59.429 --> 04:07:59.439 align:start position:0%
costs
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be dictated by where
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
the where the array is the type of the
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
array whether it's roof mount ground
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
mount the technology you're going to
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
deploy the solar panels
 
04:08:12.630 --> 04:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:14.790 --> 04:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
and it also includes some of the soft
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
costs that we have permitting
 
04:08:19.750 --> 04:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
for example which in new hampshire you
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
know it's done at the local level and so
 
04:08:24.150 --> 04:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
every every town handles a little
 
04:08:26.710 --> 04:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
differently so you know overall our soft
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
costs are relatively high in new
 
04:08:29.349 --> 04:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire just because there's no
 
04:08:29.359 --> 04:08:30.830 align:start position:0%
hampshire just because there's no
consistency

04:08:30.830 --> 04:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
consistency
 
04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
um the lack of consistency i should say
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
in some of the permitting so that comes
 
04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
down to your your actual build cost what
 
04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
madeline was talking about in her
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
example of that seven kilowatt array um
 
04:08:46.229 --> 04:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
of 25 000. now as a pr as a company
 
04:08:48.630 --> 04:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
we're constantly trying to drive those
 
04:08:50.229 --> 04:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
prices down and be as efficient as
 
04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
possible um you know and competitive in
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
the market which is which is great
 
04:08:57.670 --> 04:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
so based on those bill costs you have
 
04:08:59.189 --> 04:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
you know you got to figure out what your
 
04:09:01.510 --> 04:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
generation is and the generation is
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
based on your azimuth your pitch
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
your shading um and the system size and
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
what that's going to that's going to
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
dictate what it produces on an annual
 
04:09:11.590 --> 04:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
basis monthly and annual
 
04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
and in kilowatt hours and tied to those
 
04:09:15.910 --> 04:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours is a generation and the
 
04:09:19.269 --> 04:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
value of the kilowatt hour and that is
 
04:09:20.790 --> 04:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know your revenue stream so you're
 
04:09:20.800 --> 04:09:21.670 align:start position:0%
you know your revenue stream so you're
gonna

04:09:21.670 --> 04:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
madeline touched on rex rex's one
 
04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
revenue stream and the other one is the
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
value of the kilowatt hour and
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
i passed around i think ahead of this
 
04:09:33.269 --> 04:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
meeting just a overall policy
 
04:09:33.279 --> 04:09:34.469 align:start position:0%
meeting just a overall policy
update

04:09:34.469 --> 04:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
update
 
04:09:35.830 --> 04:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
and when it when you look at new
 
04:09:37.510 --> 04:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire and that value of the kilowatt
 
04:09:39.510 --> 04:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
hour in in our neighboring states and as
 
04:09:40.870 --> 04:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're all part of iso new
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
england you know we're on average about
 
04:09:45.750 --> 04:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
40 percent
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
less or fewer in our value of the
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour that we place on our
 
04:09:52.630 --> 04:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
generation than our neighboring states
 
04:09:54.550 --> 04:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
and that has put us at a competitive
 
04:09:56.710 --> 04:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
disadvantage in in
 
04:09:58.710 --> 04:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
and has driven our driven our payback
 
04:10:01.030 --> 04:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
times up um and
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
this number of solar adopters down so we
 
04:10:05.910 --> 04:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
have a lack of distributed generation in
 
04:10:08.070 --> 04:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
the state because our economics is not
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
as strong as our neighboring states
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
so those are two key points
 
04:10:15.189 --> 04:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
when you also look at your financials
 
04:10:18.630 --> 04:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
you also want to look at your expenses
 
04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
and solar has
 
04:10:22.790 --> 04:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
annual o m expenses operation and
 
04:10:24.150 --> 04:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance expenses they're they're
 
04:10:26.550 --> 04:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
pretty low because that system is we
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
expect it to be operational 25 plus
 
04:10:30.550 --> 04:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
years the warranties are 25 years
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
warranties are 12 years on the inverters
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
25 years in the panels
 
04:10:36.790 --> 04:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
but we also have
 
04:10:38.870 --> 04:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
taxes that we need to pay and in new
 
04:10:40.469 --> 04:10:40.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire does not have a consistent
 
04:10:40.479 --> 04:10:41.590 align:start position:0%
hampshire does not have a consistent
approach

04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
approach
 
04:10:43.990 --> 04:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
to how they tax these systems so when we
 
04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
start talking about larger commercial
 
04:10:48.710 --> 04:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
especially off-site systems that that's
 
04:10:51.670 --> 04:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
a key component on the expense side of
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
the equation
 
04:10:56.630 --> 04:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
so just balancing revenue and expenses
 
04:10:59.830 --> 04:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
and as far as you know financing it
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
really depends on the market we're
 
04:11:03.110 --> 04:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
serving right there's plenty of options
 
04:11:04.790 --> 04:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
of finance on the residential side of
 
04:11:07.269 --> 04:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
the business plenty of banks that that
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
offer a really competitive product
 
04:11:11.429 --> 04:11:11.439 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
the on-site commercial a lot of these
 
04:11:13.760 --> 04:11:15.349 align:start position:0%
the on-site commercial a lot of these
businesses

04:11:15.349 --> 04:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
will have a
 
04:11:18.630 --> 04:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
working lending relationship
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
with a bank that's willing to lend on
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
this asset because it is a revenue
 
04:11:26.150 --> 04:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
generating asset um for the business
 
04:11:28.710 --> 04:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
and then also this on the commercial
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
off-site market segment there's plenty
 
04:11:33.670 --> 04:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
of standards institutional investors
 
04:11:35.189 --> 04:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
that are willing to invest in these
 
04:11:36.950 --> 04:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
types of projects again
 
04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
i see that happening more in maine in
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
massachusetts because of much stronger
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
um incentives and
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
in a stronger value of the kilowatt hour
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
that we're placing
 
04:11:49.269 --> 04:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
um on it rather
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
than in new hampshire
 
04:11:52.710 --> 04:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
so we're seeing much higher solar
 
04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
adoption in those states than we are
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
here in in the granite state
 
04:11:57.600 --> 04:11:59.830 align:start position:0%
here in in the granite state
um

04:11:59.830 --> 04:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna just
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
stop there and and open it up to the
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
floor with any questions
 
04:12:08.389 --> 04:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
that you have um i i did if you have any
 
04:12:09.990 --> 04:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
questions specific to
 
04:12:11.910 --> 04:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
the market update that i put together
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
answer some of those as well
 
04:12:19.349 --> 04:12:19.359 align:start position:0%
okay dan thank you representative sumps
 
04:12:23.590 --> 04:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:25.349 --> 04:12:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:32.950 --> 04:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
i um to ask you about um
 
04:12:35.670 --> 04:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a couple times of the
 
04:12:37.990 --> 04:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
differences between the various states
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
that you serve massachusetts maine new
 
04:12:40.399 --> 04:12:41.910 align:start position:0%
that you serve massachusetts maine new
hampshire

04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:12:44.070 --> 04:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
and in that context you are you were
 
04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
talking about your soft costs
 
04:12:48.630 --> 04:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
and your local requirements and
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
communities um
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh in other other uh countries that are
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
doing this that they basically
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
differentiate between the cost of the
 
04:13:00.149 --> 04:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
the actual equipment the seller
 
04:13:03.269 --> 04:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
collectors versus their soft costs
 
04:13:04.710 --> 04:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
do you have can you tell me a little bit
 
04:13:06.720 --> 04:13:07.590 align:start position:0%
do you have can you tell me a little bit
about

04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:13:10.389 --> 04:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
the pricing and and the cost of those
 
04:13:13.030 --> 04:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
solar collectors historically what the
 
04:13:15.110 --> 04:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
pricing has done in the last let's say
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
10 years and also have there been any
 
04:13:20.070 --> 04:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
any improvements in this in the soft
 
04:13:22.469 --> 04:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
costs to try to reduce those as well
 
04:13:27.910 --> 04:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:30.229 --> 04:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um sure i don't
 
04:13:30.239 --> 04:13:32.070 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um sure i don't
i

04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:13:34.229 --> 04:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
did not come to this meeting with
 
04:13:34.239 --> 04:13:35.189 align:start position:0%
did not come to this meeting with
my

04:13:35.189 --> 04:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:13:36.070 --> 04:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:13:38.550 --> 04:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
cost stack per se sorry i'm not going to
 
04:13:41.429 --> 04:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
get into the details but in general the
 
04:13:43.110 --> 04:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
cost of the technology the cost of the
 
04:13:45.030 --> 04:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
equipment the hard costs the solar
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
panels the inverters
 
04:13:49.510 --> 04:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
those have come down over the past 10
 
04:13:51.990 --> 04:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
years because the inverter the modules
 
04:13:54.550 --> 04:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
and panels considerably have come down
 
04:13:57.269 --> 04:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
when i first got into the business
 
04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
we were installing seven eight nine
 
04:14:01.750 --> 04:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
dollars a watt and now we're down to two
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
to three three dollars and fifty cents a
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
watt um installed so we've seen
 
04:14:09.030 --> 04:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
tremendous decrease um
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the equipment the hard
 
04:14:11.760 --> 04:14:13.110 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the equipment the hard
costs

04:14:13.110 --> 04:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
costs
 
04:14:15.030 --> 04:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
what we've seen an uptick in is as i
 
04:14:17.110 --> 04:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned is the soft cost is permitting
 
04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
now we
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
while we have tried to roll out some
 
04:14:25.670 --> 04:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
streamlined efficiencies and you know
 
04:14:28.469 --> 04:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
every few years new codes get adopted
 
04:14:30.389 --> 04:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
and the industry adopts
 
04:14:30.399 --> 04:14:31.189 align:start position:0%
and the industry adopts
and

04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:32.950 --> 04:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
you know you need to
 
04:14:35.830 --> 04:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
you need to learn and educate and teach
 
04:14:38.149 --> 04:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
local code enforcement and vice versa
 
04:14:40.469 --> 04:14:40.479 align:start position:0%
it goes back and forth those way both
 
04:14:40.479 --> 04:14:41.349 align:start position:0%
it goes back and forth those way both
ways

04:14:41.349 --> 04:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
ways
 
04:14:44.149 --> 04:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
um and that just just that just slowly
 
04:14:46.389 --> 04:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
adds costs over time
 
04:14:47.670 --> 04:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
labor costs
 
04:14:52.149 --> 04:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
have gone up as well um
 
04:14:54.070 --> 04:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
as you probably all know
 
04:14:56.950 --> 04:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
the trades are are tight it's a tight
 
04:14:59.429 --> 04:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
job market in the trades and um
 
04:15:02.710 --> 04:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
you know those in in for good reasons
 
04:15:05.510 --> 04:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
100 of all all the installers need to be
 
04:15:07.269 --> 04:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
licensed electricians
 
04:15:09.670 --> 04:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
and re-run a in-house program
 
04:15:11.189 --> 04:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program
 
04:15:13.349 --> 04:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
for those licensed electricians but
 
04:15:13.359 --> 04:15:14.550 align:start position:0%
for those licensed electricians but
um

04:15:14.550 --> 04:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:16.309 --> 04:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
they in the the great thing is they
 
04:15:19.830 --> 04:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
offer really good well-paying jobs
 
04:15:21.269 --> 04:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
but those costs have continued to
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
increase as well so while we've seen a
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
reduction in
 
04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
the hard costs and materials we've we've
 
04:15:29.110 --> 04:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
seen an increase in both labor and soft
 
04:15:31.510 --> 04:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
costs of permitting and i'll also
 
04:15:34.229 --> 04:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
mention interconnection as well
 
04:15:35.750 --> 04:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
not so much um
 
04:15:38.229 --> 04:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
you know i believe especially on the
 
04:15:40.469 --> 04:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
small scale generator side
 
04:15:42.469 --> 04:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
interconnections relatively streamlined
 
04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
with utilities but once you get into the
 
04:15:46.149 --> 04:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
larger projects there's a lot of
 
04:15:47.990 --> 04:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
unknowns there's a lot of hard costs
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
you've got to pay with the utilities
 
04:15:51.990 --> 04:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
such as you know system impact study
 
04:15:53.670 --> 04:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
ranges anywhere from twenty to thirty
 
04:15:55.910 --> 04:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars before you can even
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
move forward with the system
 
04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
madeline mentioned an example of a
 
04:15:59.520 --> 04:16:01.189 align:start position:0%
madeline mentioned an example of a
transformer

04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
transformer
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know some of those costs do arise
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
that come up while you're building these
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
systems on the smaller scale and more
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
likely on the larger scale so those
 
04:16:15.510 --> 04:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
costs continue to creep in as well
 
04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh follow mr term
 
04:16:18.870 --> 04:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
04:16:18.880 --> 04:16:19.830 align:start position:0%
go ahead
uh

04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
mr clap could you uh give me a little
 
04:16:25.349 --> 04:16:25.359 align:start position:0%
idea of what what are your differences
 
04:16:25.359 --> 04:16:27.269 align:start position:0%
idea of what what are your differences
between

04:16:27.269 --> 04:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
how you approach a residential
 
04:16:29.279 --> 04:16:30.630 align:start position:0%
how you approach a residential
installation

04:16:30.630 --> 04:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
installation
 
04:16:38.229 --> 04:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:41.510 --> 04:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um representative are you speaking
 
04:16:42.630 --> 04:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
can you provide a little bit more
 
04:16:44.550 --> 04:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
context of what you're looking for well
 
04:16:48.070 --> 04:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
yes i'm i'm i'm thinking that uh when
 
04:16:51.030 --> 04:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
the projects go from small to big
 
04:16:52.870 --> 04:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
i assume there are things that happen
 
04:16:52.880 --> 04:16:53.910 align:start position:0%
i assume there are things that happen
that

04:16:53.910 --> 04:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:56.389 --> 04:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
on the municipal level for example
 
04:16:58.630 --> 04:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
requirements that you might have to meet
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
or or the scale is so much different
 
04:17:03.910 --> 04:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
compared to like a residential rooftop
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
installation so um
 
04:17:09.510 --> 04:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
and is that something
 
04:17:12.630 --> 04:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
that maybe the state or we as a body
 
04:17:14.030 --> 04:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
should look into some type of
 
04:17:16.149 --> 04:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
standardization of these of these
 
04:17:17.910 --> 04:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
projects so that
 
04:17:20.630 --> 04:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
that businesses can have confidence that
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
this is the standard that everyone can
 
04:17:25.269 --> 04:17:25.279 align:start position:0%
use that might improve and reduce the
 
04:17:25.279 --> 04:17:29.429 align:start position:0%
use that might improve and reduce the
cost

04:17:29.429 --> 04:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.189 --> 04:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:35.189 --> 04:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
it is true the bigger the project
 
04:17:37.349 --> 04:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
probably slightly more complex but it is
 
04:17:39.910 --> 04:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
it does come down to scale right uh
 
04:17:40.950 --> 04:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:17:43.910 --> 04:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
i the resident on the residential side
 
04:17:47.349 --> 04:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
it's relatively straightforward from a
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
pure engineering interconnection
 
04:17:49.680 --> 04:17:51.110 align:start position:0%
pure engineering interconnection
perspective

04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
04:17:53.670 --> 04:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
the bigger the project more complex it
 
04:17:53.680 --> 04:17:54.950 align:start position:0%
the bigger the project more complex it
becomes

04:17:54.950 --> 04:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
04:17:57.189 --> 04:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
mainly from you know design
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:04.149 --> 04:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
in potentially interconnection costs
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
but as far as you know i i maybe
 
04:18:09.510 --> 04:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
madeline can can jump in here just from
 
04:18:12.469 --> 04:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
a perspective of of just streamlining
 
04:18:14.469 --> 04:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
some of the permitting and stuff but you
 
04:18:16.870 --> 04:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
know we we try to
 
04:18:18.950 --> 04:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
have some guidelines that we that we
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
roll out um that we face but it's hard
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
for me to
 
04:18:26.630 --> 04:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to say there's any um
 
04:18:28.710 --> 04:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
consistency between
 
04:18:30.790 --> 04:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
between those those three those two i
 
04:18:32.790 --> 04:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
mean we we take a different approach
 
04:18:34.149 --> 04:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
where i mean residential is pretty
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
straightforward homeowner needs to make
 
04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
a decision when you start getting into
 
04:18:37.760 --> 04:18:39.110 align:start position:0%
a decision when you start getting into
larger

04:18:39.110 --> 04:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
larger
 
04:18:39.120 --> 04:18:40.309 align:start position:0%
larger
systems

04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
systems
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
um a little bit more complex with the
 
04:18:45.349 --> 04:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
business and the tax incentives
 
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
the financial arrangements so from the
 
04:18:49.590 --> 04:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities for example you start to
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
enter third party financing agreements
 
04:18:53.590 --> 04:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
or power purchase agreements to get
 
04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
these systems um capitalized and
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
financed and completed
 
04:19:00.790 --> 04:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
so from a
 
04:19:02.710 --> 04:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
capital stack perspective a lot
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
different but from more of a technology
 
04:19:05.279 --> 04:19:07.110 align:start position:0%
different but from more of a technology
interconnection

04:19:07.110 --> 04:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
interconnection
 
04:19:09.269 --> 04:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
you know it's more just your scale there
 
04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
is some more complexity
 
04:19:13.429 --> 04:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
and you know larger systems are gonna
 
04:19:13.439 --> 04:19:14.950 align:start position:0%
and you know larger systems are gonna
trigger

04:19:14.950 --> 04:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
trigger
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
um utility upgrades that smaller systems
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
would not
 
04:19:20.710 --> 04:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
and so you need to you know those larger
 
04:19:22.870 --> 04:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
systems need to be big enough scale
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to absorb some of those
 
04:19:26.550 --> 04:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
additional costs
 
04:19:29.110 --> 04:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire
 
04:19:30.630 --> 04:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
utilities have
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
in general
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's been a little bit
 
04:19:36.149 --> 04:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
tougher in general to interconnect
 
04:19:39.269 --> 04:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
larger arrays in new hampshire
 
04:19:39.279 --> 04:19:40.070 align:start position:0%
larger arrays in new hampshire
the

04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
rule of thumb is when you get you know
 
04:19:43.990 --> 04:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
over half a megawatt of 500 k 500
 
04:19:46.229 --> 04:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
kilowatts you know utilities that
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
triggers reclosures which which add a
 
04:19:51.030 --> 04:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
significant amount of cost um to the
 
04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
system and
 
04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
as everybody probably everybody on here
 
04:19:55.910 --> 04:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
knows that you know
 
04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
as as the generator you're responsible
 
04:19:59.910 --> 04:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
for those costs to upgrade and that
 
04:20:01.750 --> 04:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
becomes that that that's a benefit to
 
04:20:03.910 --> 04:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
the ratepayer um because we're we're
 
04:20:06.070 --> 04:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
paying for these um for the distribution
 
04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
lines to be upgraded
 
04:20:07.760 --> 04:20:08.870 align:start position:0%
lines to be upgraded
um

04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:10.710 --> 04:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
you know at no cost to the ratepayer
 
04:20:13.349 --> 04:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
which is which is a benefit but
 
04:20:14.550 --> 04:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answered your
 
04:20:16.790 --> 04:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
question that i kind of
 
04:20:19.030 --> 04:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
stared all over the place there but uh
 
04:20:21.510 --> 04:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i can add a little bit so as far as
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
you dan started to get into municipal
 
04:20:26.070 --> 04:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
projects and third-party ownership or
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
financing or ppas or leases so we work a
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
lot with energy committees that want to
 
04:20:34.469 --> 04:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
look at procuring a solar array for
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
example a renewable energy project for
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
their town and
 
04:20:37.199 --> 04:20:38.309 align:start position:0%
their town and
because

04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:20:41.110 --> 04:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
one of the big things that can help
 
04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
finance a
 
04:20:45.110 --> 04:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
renewable energy project is the federal
 
04:20:47.110 --> 04:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
investment tax credit
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
obviously that's not available to
 
04:20:50.070 --> 04:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
municipality because they're not paying
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
federal taxes
 
04:20:54.389 --> 04:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
so that is when we try to advise them
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
and we've developed some resources to
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
try and have them put out requests for
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
proposals that allows them to compare
 
04:21:00.479 --> 04:21:01.750 align:start position:0%
proposals that allows them to compare
both

04:21:01.750 --> 04:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
both
 
04:21:03.189 --> 04:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
what would it look like to own the
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
system and what would it look like to do
 
04:21:07.910 --> 04:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
what's called a power purchase agreement
 
04:21:11.349 --> 04:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
but have an investor on the system that
 
04:21:13.910 --> 04:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
can realize that tax credit which
 
04:21:16.070 --> 04:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
indirectly allows the municipality to
 
04:21:17.910 --> 04:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
realize the financial benefits of the
 
04:21:19.349 --> 04:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
tax credit
 
04:21:20.950 --> 04:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
and then usually there's a buy out
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
option for the municipality
 
04:21:25.269 --> 04:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
and so that's something that we i didn't
 
04:21:27.429 --> 04:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
talk too too much about but
 
04:21:30.070 --> 04:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
that federal investment tax credit
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
can be beneficial for business if
 
04:21:31.680 --> 04:21:32.710 align:start position:0%
can be beneficial for business if
they're

04:21:32.710 --> 04:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:21:34.950 --> 04:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
investing in their own system but in
 
04:21:37.269 --> 04:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
order for a municipality or non-profit
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to realize that benefit it
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
you do have to sort of go around it to
 
04:21:44.389 --> 04:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
have an investor
 
04:21:45.750 --> 04:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
04:21:48.630 --> 04:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
invest in that project or back that
 
04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
project and then effectively sell the
 
04:21:55.590 --> 04:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
electricity to the municipality
 
04:21:57.269 --> 04:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
so that the investor can realize the tax
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
credit and and transfer the value to the
 
04:22:02.229 --> 04:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
municipality and then oftentimes there's
 
04:22:03.990 --> 04:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
an option for municipality to buy out
 
04:22:08.309 --> 04:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
the project on year seven of the project
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
okay representative pimentel you have a
 
04:22:17.359 --> 04:22:23.590 align:start position:0%
okay representative pimentel you have a
question

04:22:23.590 --> 04:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:23.600 --> 04:22:24.389 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:22:24.389 --> 04:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:22:26.550 --> 04:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:22:26.560 --> 04:22:27.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

04:22:27.510 --> 04:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:30.790 --> 04:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things you mentioned uh
 
04:22:33.670 --> 04:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
mr clapp was the um
 
04:22:36.550 --> 04:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
that one of the problems with selling
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
solar panels in new hampshire
 
04:22:41.349 --> 04:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
was that our that we have a lower cost
 
04:22:43.830 --> 04:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
of energy compared to our neighboring
 
04:22:43.840 --> 04:22:45.189 align:start position:0%
of energy compared to our neighboring
states

04:22:45.189 --> 04:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:22:45.199 --> 04:22:46.950 align:start position:0%
states
um

04:22:46.950 --> 04:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
which is kind of surprising to me but
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you have any kind of
 
04:22:52.500 --> 04:22:52.510 align:start position:0%
insight on on
 
04:22:52.510 --> 04:22:53.750 align:start position:0%
insight on on
[Music]

04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:22:57.110 --> 04:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
why that is and
 
04:22:59.349 --> 04:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know obviously we want lower prices
 
04:23:05.189 --> 04:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:07.269 --> 04:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative
 
04:23:11.030 --> 04:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so i my specific uh
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
statement was not to the lower cost of
 
04:23:13.439 --> 04:23:14.870 align:start position:0%
statement was not to the lower cost of
energy

04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
energy
 
04:23:16.550 --> 04:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
compared to the other states it was the
 
04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
lower value of the that we place in the
 
04:23:20.309 --> 04:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour
 
04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
on the generation of the solar array
 
04:23:23.199 --> 04:23:25.269 align:start position:0%
on the generation of the solar array
so

04:23:25.269 --> 04:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:27.429 --> 04:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
and that that's that's basically due to
 
04:23:29.429 --> 04:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
our net metering policy
 
04:23:31.349 --> 04:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
so when you look at vermont maine and
 
04:23:31.359 --> 04:23:32.710 align:start position:0%
so when you look at vermont maine and
massachusetts

04:23:32.710 --> 04:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
on average what they're valuing the
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour to be is about 40 percent
 
04:23:37.990 --> 04:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
higher than what the what new hampshire
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
values that kilowatt hour to be
 
04:23:42.070 --> 04:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
from the generation of these of these
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
this from the distributed generate
 
04:23:46.389 --> 04:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
generators here the asset the solar
 
04:23:46.399 --> 04:23:47.670 align:start position:0%
generators here the asset the solar
assets

04:23:47.670 --> 04:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
assets
 
04:23:48.790 --> 04:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
with that lower value um and i and i
 
04:23:54.630 --> 04:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
forgot to touch touch upon
 
04:23:56.550 --> 04:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
you know we've had the investment tax
 
04:23:58.950 --> 04:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
credit the itc stepped down from 30 to
 
04:24:02.149 --> 04:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
26 now the 26 will be held for the next
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
few years before it drops to 22
 
04:24:06.630 --> 04:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
and 10
 
04:24:08.469 --> 04:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
that in addition to
 
04:24:09.510 --> 04:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:24:12.309 --> 04:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
us reducing the rebate levels
 
04:24:14.469 --> 04:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
has made the but has really tightened up
 
04:24:16.389 --> 04:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
the financials in new hampshire to the
 
04:24:17.429 --> 04:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
point where
 
04:24:19.510 --> 04:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's driving
 
04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
down roi and up payback um years
 
04:24:25.670 --> 04:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're adopting less and less we're
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
having fewer businesses
 
04:24:28.080 --> 04:24:30.389 align:start position:0%
having fewer businesses
um

04:24:30.389 --> 04:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:32.950 --> 04:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
transition to you know renewable than we
 
04:24:34.870 --> 04:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
did in the past and it's just a
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
combination of factors there so that's
 
04:24:41.910 --> 04:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:43.990 --> 04:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up security
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up
 
04:24:50.309 --> 04:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
are we are we putting our price
 
04:24:55.189 --> 04:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily low or vice versa are they
 
04:24:57.830 --> 04:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
putting theirs arbitrarily high i mean
 
04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh what how do how did those prices get
 
04:25:00.800 --> 04:25:02.630 align:start position:0%
uh what how do how did those prices get
determined

04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
determined
 
04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
04:25:09.670 --> 04:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
i might ask madeline to take this one
 
04:25:09.680 --> 04:25:10.389 align:start position:0%
i might ask madeline to take this one
but

04:25:10.389 --> 04:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:25:12.070 --> 04:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
the puc docket that came out in two was
 
04:25:17.269 --> 04:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
2015 madeline i think it wrapped in
 
04:25:17.279 --> 04:25:18.870 align:start position:0%
2015 madeline i think it wrapped in
2017.

04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
2017.
 
04:25:20.790 --> 04:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
i mean there there's multiple studies
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
through the new hampshire puc on the
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
value of solar or value distributed
 
04:25:28.080 --> 04:25:29.269 align:start position:0%
value of solar or value distributed
generation

04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
generation
 
04:25:30.790 --> 04:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
those studies have been done
 
04:25:30.800 --> 04:25:32.070 align:start position:0%
those studies have been done
independently

04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
independently
 
04:25:33.910 --> 04:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
and they've been done in other states
 
04:25:35.990 --> 04:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
and they have found conclusively that
 
04:25:38.229 --> 04:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
the value of solar is a lot higher than
 
04:25:40.149 --> 04:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
what we have placing it in new hampshire
 
04:25:41.670 --> 04:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
so we have yet to do those studies
 
04:25:43.830 --> 04:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
through our puc in the state
 
04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
other states have done so
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
um and the value is higher they have
 
04:25:50.389 --> 04:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
driven they have made sure they've taken
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
the conscious choice to
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
develop more distributed generation
 
04:25:57.910 --> 04:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
solar in particular um and that is only
 
04:25:59.910 --> 04:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
benefiting the ratepayers in the long
 
04:25:59.920 --> 04:26:00.870 align:start position:0%
benefiting the ratepayers in the long
term

04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
term
 
04:26:02.710 --> 04:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
and madeline you might probably give a
 
04:26:05.429 --> 04:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
much more detailed answer than that yeah
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
how the values have been determined in
 
04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
different states are either through
 
04:26:11.510 --> 04:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislation or regulatory processes so
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
some states will set them in legislation
 
04:26:15.910 --> 04:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
but most states are done through
 
04:26:17.750 --> 04:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory processes at the public
 
04:26:19.590 --> 04:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
utility commissions or whatever the
 
04:26:20.870 --> 04:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
equivalent of the public utility
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
commission is in that state
 
04:26:26.229 --> 04:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
um are we too low or are they too high
 
04:26:27.910 --> 04:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
um you know my candid approach would be
 
04:26:29.750 --> 04:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we're too low and they might be a
 
04:26:32.309 --> 04:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
little overly generous however those
 
04:26:34.550 --> 04:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
states have made a policy decisions that
 
04:26:37.189 --> 04:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
that is an investment they want to make
 
04:26:39.189 --> 04:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
and so if you want to get a lot of
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
development real fast then sure be
 
04:26:43.990 --> 04:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
generous and attract a lot of investment
 
04:26:45.510 --> 04:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
and a lot of new jobs and a lot of
 
04:26:47.349 --> 04:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
development to your state
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
that's a great way to get a lot of
 
04:26:51.110 --> 04:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
development in your state and some of
 
04:26:52.870 --> 04:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
those states that have made really
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
aggressive goals for renewable energy or
 
04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
emission reductions
 
04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
they're deciding that they really want
 
04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
to spur development and investment and
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
so they're doing that by having generous
 
04:27:03.760 --> 04:27:05.189 align:start position:0%
so they're doing that by having generous
incentives

04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
incentives
 
04:27:08.309 --> 04:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
i definitely think that our compensation
 
04:27:10.550 --> 04:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
is undervaluing
 
04:27:13.590 --> 04:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
distributed generation
 
04:27:15.590 --> 04:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
 
04:27:15.600 --> 04:27:16.550 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
question

04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:27:18.630 --> 04:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
i heard the speaker a couple of times
 
04:27:20.630 --> 04:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
talk about a benefit to the rape players
 
04:27:21.670 --> 04:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
was when he said uh over 500 kilowatts
 
04:27:26.790 --> 04:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
you need reclosers and those reclosers
 
04:27:29.189 --> 04:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
are because of the project otherwise
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be needed how about how is
 
04:27:34.149 --> 04:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
putting those rate poses in to take care
 
04:27:38.470 --> 04:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:38.480 --> 04:27:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:27:42.149 --> 04:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:27:45.030 --> 04:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's a it's a good point so
 
04:27:47.750 --> 04:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
in general i was talking about just
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
overall utility upgrades but a lot of
 
04:27:52.070 --> 04:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
time those re-closures they can actually
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
be smart re-closures and it gives the
 
04:27:55.510 --> 04:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
utility better control
 
04:27:55.520 --> 04:27:56.389 align:start position:0%
utility better control
um

04:27:56.389 --> 04:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:58.469 --> 04:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
over their voltage in their in their
 
04:28:00.309 --> 04:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
where the where that power is going so
 
04:28:01.750 --> 04:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
there is a benefit
 
04:28:03.429 --> 04:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
on the utility side are they taking
 
04:28:05.510 --> 04:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
advantage of that that's that's another
 
04:28:05.520 --> 04:28:06.550 align:start position:0%
advantage of that that's that's another
question

04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:28:06.560 --> 04:28:07.670 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:07.680 --> 04:28:08.630 align:start position:0%
um
but

04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:28:10.870 --> 04:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
the utility and this is where
 
04:28:13.269 --> 04:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
private developers can work closely with
 
04:28:13.279 --> 04:28:14.550 align:start position:0%
private developers can work closely with
utilities

04:28:14.550 --> 04:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
04:28:17.429 --> 04:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
and and help in in being smart about
 
04:28:19.590 --> 04:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
upgrading the distribution grid so we're
 
04:28:21.670 --> 04:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
actually working towards a smart grid of
 
04:28:23.429 --> 04:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
the future
 
04:28:25.750 --> 04:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
and this is this is one opportunity that
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
you we can we can take advantage of for
 
04:28:27.600 --> 04:28:29.830 align:start position:0%
you we can we can take advantage of for
sure

04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:28:32.229 --> 04:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
there are definitely some upgrades that
 
04:28:33.910 --> 04:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know can be significant so for
 
04:28:36.550 --> 04:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
example a utility may have said
 
04:28:38.550 --> 04:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
um over the next 10 years we need to
 
04:28:39.750 --> 04:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
make a significant upgrade to this
 
04:28:42.469 --> 04:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
substation and because a large utility
 
04:28:45.030 --> 04:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
scale project interconnects to that
 
04:28:45.040 --> 04:28:45.990 align:start position:0%
scale project interconnects to that
circuit

04:28:45.990 --> 04:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
circuit
 
04:28:48.229 --> 04:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
involving that substation they may make
 
04:28:50.790 --> 04:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
a significant investment
 
04:28:53.670 --> 04:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
to make that substation upgrade early
 
04:28:55.750 --> 04:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
then the developers make is incurring
 
04:28:58.550 --> 04:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
that cost for example and that makes it
 
04:29:00.550 --> 04:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
so that the cost that the utility was
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:29:04.149 --> 04:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
put on their rate payers in the next
 
04:29:06.790 --> 04:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
five to ten years then is not going to
 
04:29:11.349 --> 04:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative samson
 
04:29:18.630 --> 04:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:21.030 --> 04:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
yes i believe um mr haydock sent us an
 
04:29:22.710 --> 04:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
email and said that he unfortunately had
 
04:29:23.910 --> 04:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
to leave
 
04:29:25.429 --> 04:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
he did okay
 
04:29:27.110 --> 04:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh representative
 
04:29:28.389 --> 04:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
sam said you're recognized for a
 
04:29:28.399 --> 04:29:29.590 align:start position:0%
sam said you're recognized for a
question

04:29:29.590 --> 04:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:29:32.790 --> 04:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
oh thank you mr chairman um i just want
 
04:29:35.670 --> 04:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
to kind of uh follow up my understanding
 
04:29:38.149 --> 04:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
of how these um
 
04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
the net value of distributed energy uh
 
04:29:45.189 --> 04:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
kilowatts are valued uh have to do a lot
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
with not just the
 
04:29:51.110 --> 04:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
actual availability of the energy
 
04:29:53.590 --> 04:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
but mainly about the health impacts
 
04:29:56.710 --> 04:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts and also economic
 
04:29:56.720 --> 04:29:57.830 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts and also economic
impacts

04:29:57.830 --> 04:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
04:30:00.389 --> 04:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
in a particular state and those states
 
04:30:02.790 --> 04:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
have to make that judgment on their own
 
04:30:02.800 --> 04:30:03.670 align:start position:0%
have to make that judgment on their own
about

04:30:03.670 --> 04:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:30:05.830 --> 04:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
how much do they think that benefits
 
04:30:08.790 --> 04:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
their state and i think that's how these
 
04:30:11.830 --> 04:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
numbers get get put together to to come
 
04:30:14.710 --> 04:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
up with a net value of the energy
 
04:30:17.110 --> 04:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh is that is that your understanding
 
04:30:21.590 --> 04:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:21.600 --> 04:30:22.309 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:30:23.349 --> 04:30:23.359 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:30:25.830 --> 04:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
and i might defer again to madeleine
 
04:30:28.229 --> 04:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the recent report that
 
04:30:28.239 --> 04:30:29.269 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the recent report that
was

04:30:29.269 --> 04:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:30:29.279 --> 04:30:30.309 align:start position:0%
was
um

04:30:30.309 --> 04:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:31.830 --> 04:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
just completed
 
04:30:33.910 --> 04:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
right but you're right there's there's
 
04:30:35.429 --> 04:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
04:30:37.510 --> 04:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
value of that kilowatt hour generated on
 
04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
the grid
 
04:30:38.560 --> 04:30:39.670 align:start position:0%
the grid
and

04:30:39.670 --> 04:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:42.309 --> 04:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
you know reduction in capacity pricing
 
04:30:42.319 --> 04:30:43.030 align:start position:0%
you know reduction in capacity pricing
and

04:30:43.030 --> 04:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:44.389 --> 04:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
a bunch of other factors and then
 
04:30:46.070 --> 04:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's the external
 
04:30:49.590 --> 04:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
value of of societal benefits um and you
 
04:30:51.429 --> 04:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
can look at them into two different
 
04:30:53.429 --> 04:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
windows but
 
04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
other states have clear
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
state policies
 
04:31:02.149 --> 04:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
that allow their
 
04:31:04.469 --> 04:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
regulatory commissions for example
 
04:31:06.550 --> 04:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
to count the
 
04:31:08.950 --> 04:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
monetary value assigned to an
 
04:31:10.710 --> 04:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
environmental benefit
 
04:31:12.790 --> 04:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
because it goes towards achieving a
 
04:31:14.229 --> 04:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
state policy
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we have no
 
04:31:19.830 --> 04:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas reduction goal in statute
 
04:31:22.389 --> 04:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
and so we are very careful and our
 
04:31:23.910 --> 04:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission is very
 
04:31:23.920 --> 04:31:24.870 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission is very
careful

04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
careful
 
04:31:27.429 --> 04:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
to not assign a value
 
04:31:29.590 --> 04:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
that there is no state law stating it
 
04:31:30.950 --> 04:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
has a value
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
so when we are at the commission and we
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
are looking at benefit cost analyses for
 
04:31:34.960 --> 04:31:36.229 align:start position:0%
are looking at benefit cost analyses for
example

04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:31:39.110 --> 04:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
we are only looking at hard
 
04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
electricity values
 
04:31:41.279 --> 04:31:42.389 align:start position:0%
electricity values
so

04:31:42.389 --> 04:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:44.710 --> 04:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
we um i think dan was referring to the
 
04:31:47.110 --> 04:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
synapse report that we and other
 
04:31:49.030 --> 04:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
organizations commissioned
 
04:31:51.590 --> 04:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
and that looked it broke apart the cost
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
right so if you're looking just at the
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
energy value
 
04:31:57.269 --> 04:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
avoided you know the effect on the
 
04:32:00.630 --> 04:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
wholesale market in the avoided capacity
 
04:32:02.070 --> 04:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
they found that
 
04:32:05.349 --> 04:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
exported distributed solar had a value
 
04:32:06.630 --> 04:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
of over
 
04:32:06.640 --> 04:32:07.670 align:start position:0%
of over
13

04:32:07.670 --> 04:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
13
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
13 a kilowatt hour
 
04:32:12.630 --> 04:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
so that's more than our our projects are
 
04:32:12.640 --> 04:32:13.670 align:start position:0%
so that's more than our our projects are
getting

04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
getting
 
04:32:15.429 --> 04:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
if you do want to consider
 
04:32:18.790 --> 04:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
public health value environmental value
 
04:32:22.710 --> 04:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
you start to get very quickly into the
 
04:32:25.110 --> 04:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
20 cents a kilowatt hour for example
 
04:32:27.990 --> 04:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
but it is according to each state's
 
04:32:28.000 --> 04:32:29.349 align:start position:0%
but it is according to each state's
policy

04:32:29.349 --> 04:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
policy
 
04:32:31.349 --> 04:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
to decide if it is the policy of the
 
04:32:33.750 --> 04:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
state that those benefits have a value
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
that should be compensated for or not
 
04:32:37.110 --> 04:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:32:39.030 --> 04:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
we get into these arguments all the time
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
at the commission and we are told very
 
04:32:42.469 --> 04:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
clearly that since new hampshire has no
 
04:32:42.479 --> 04:32:43.429 align:start position:0%
clearly that since new hampshire has no
law

04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:32:45.429 --> 04:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
that says it would benefit
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
