plaistow i'm here as a prime sponsor of

house bill 1153 relative to absentee
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
ballot requests
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty straightforward and if
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
you look at the language it's a pretty
 
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.670 align:start position:0%
you look at the language it's a pretty
short

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
short
 
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.790 align:start position:0%
short
amendment

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does it clarifies
 
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
that an absentee ballot
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
may not be you know in this we're
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
talking about an official absentee
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
ballot may not be mailed to
 
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
an absentee voter before that absentee
 
00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:57.270 align:start position:0%
an absentee voter before that absentee
voter

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
voter
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
has um
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
signed up and
 
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.830 align:start position:0%
signed up and
and

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
is listed in the town as a voter
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
so in other words right now under
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
anybody can request an official absentee
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
ballot and you don't have to be a
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
registered voter
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
what this
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
bill does
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
it amends rsa 657 colon 12
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
in 657 12
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
ascertain if the
 
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.430 align:start position:0%
ascertain if the
applicant

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
applicant
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
on the checklist is on the checklist for
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
the town if they're not an absentee
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
official absentee ballot won't be
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh mailed
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
upon so if somebody is rejected of
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
getting an absentee ballot because then
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
they haven't registered yet they can
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
then register to vote if they're
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
legal and a resident of that town to
 
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
to vote they can
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
register to vote in such time an
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot will be sent to them so
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
this kind of puts
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
the horse before the car instead of the
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
other way around
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's a common sense bill
 
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.230 align:start position:0%
it's it's a common sense bill
that

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
requires that you are
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
registered to vote before you get an
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
official ballot and and the reason for
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
this is to ensure that um
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
again it's a vote integrity
 
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.310 align:start position:0%
again it's a vote integrity
item

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's important to keep track of ballots
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
and if we have a bunch of ballots
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
floating around going to somebody that's
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
not registered to vote that's
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
problematic so this cleans it up and
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
i hope you support the bill and with
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
that i'll take any questions that the
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
committee may have do committee members
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so does that mean that say uh
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
someone who was disabled and homebound
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
would have to make two
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
efforts to would have to register to
 
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.750 align:start position:0%
efforts to would have to register to
vote

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
by mail and then make another effort to
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
get the absentee ballot after doing that
 
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.590 align:start position:0%
get the absentee ballot after doing that
so

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
there's no exclusion in this anybody
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
that wants to vote in new hampshire has
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
registered to vote before they get the
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
the application can be sent in and you
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to so let's say you want to
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
go down to the town clerk to register to
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
vote you can do that
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
but you don't have to make another trip
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
if you're going to vote by absentee
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
ballot you can send your request in
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
this simply says you have to take care
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
of step one first being registered step
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
two is then apply for the ballot
 
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.310 align:start position:0%
two is then apply for the ballot
question

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
we're here representative bergeron ah
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
just a question there is a provision in
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
state law
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's this provision
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
it's another one
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
where if someone is registering to vote
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
by mail
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
the right to request an absentee ballot
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.509 align:start position:0%
at the same time
and

00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
both the voter registration application
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
and the absentee ballot are sent to the
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
polls on election day
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
first the voter registrar has to
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
determine whether the person is eligible
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
to be registered or not and if so then
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
the moderator can rule on whether or not
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
to cast the ballot is it your intent to
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
do away with that uh procedure
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
well again it the the
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
the intent is
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
to do as i as i
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned in testimony here to ensure
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
that when somebody
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
applies for the absentee ballot
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
that they're registered before that is
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
sent from the town clerk
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
nothing in this language prevents
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
somebody that wants to go down and same
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
day register from doing that so it
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't preclude that um
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
but it again it's it's
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
it's to prevent somebody getting an
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
absentee official absentee ballot that
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
at that point in time legally registered
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office has
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on this bill further
 
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.790 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on this bill further
questions

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative moorehead thank you madam
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i'm sitting
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
behind you unfortunately but i can see
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
you in the corner there's a mirror maybe
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
so if the intent you're adding one
 
00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:33.030 align:start position:0%
so if the intent you're adding one
sentence

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
this bill would add one sentence to
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
rsa 657-12
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
and that one sentence says that under no
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances shall a clerk mail a
 
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.230 align:start position:0%
circumstances shall a clerk mail a
ballot

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.509 align:start position:0%
ballot
unless

00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
unless
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
a person has submitted an absentee
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
ballot application so no ballot without
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
first an application that's what's being
 
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.110 align:start position:0%
first an application that's what's being
added

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the is there anything
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
here that has that speaks to whether
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
someone's been registered
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
i think this one sentence as i read it
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
only speaks to whether someone has
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
already submitted an application
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question well it
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
amends the rsa 657 colon 12
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
and and that's where it
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
indicates that um you have to be
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
registered to vote prior to the town
 
00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:18.310 align:start position:0%
registered to vote prior to the town
clerk

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
sending the ballot the absentee ballot
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
my understanding is this already occurs
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
in manchester we don't mail out ballots
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative um i consulted with the
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh now retired secretary of state on
 
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.470 align:start position:0%

this
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
and he indicated that there are cases
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
where absentee ballots go out and in
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
fact and i can't speak for the current
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
secretary of state but but the then
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.629 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
supported

00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
supported
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
the idea of making this amendment
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
terozian also signed up to speak on this
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh dan healy representing new hampshire
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
city and town clerks association um and
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
we oppose this bill
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh basically for the reasons that
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron just mentioned
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
we do currently
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
have some
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances where we send out absentee
 
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.189 align:start position:0%
circumstances where we send out absentee
ballots

00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
requests the request form to people that
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
are um
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
currently registered they have the apps
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
they request the absentee registration
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
packet and along with that we send the
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
request form to them
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
they would need to fill out everything
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
have it approved
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
before their ballots
 
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.509 align:start position:0%
before their ballots
counted

00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
counted
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
so there are a few circumstances
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
some residents that will write a letter
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
requesting an absentee ballot and we'll
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
take that as their initial request we'll
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
send the absentee request form along
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
with the ballot
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
they need to complete that request form
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
before their ballots
 
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.629 align:start position:0%
before their ballots
counted

00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
counted
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
so we don't actually count any ballots
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
without a request on file but there are
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
a few circumstances where it's
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
beneficial to send out the request
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
along with the ballot
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
people call a few days before an
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
election they don't have a printer they
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
might be elderly they don't have access
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
to print out the application and send it
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
so to save some back and forth we do
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
send the requests
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
with the belt we get that back but
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
none of our ballots are counted unless
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
there's a request attached to it
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
so i'd be open to any questions
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members for mr
 
00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:18.629 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members for mr
healey

00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you i have a question
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is sometimes this is
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
this would be people who are not
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
registered for whatever reason but they
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
want to get an absentee ballot would
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
this be
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
people who are in a nursing home in
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
derry who
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
things like that yeah sometimes it is is
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes um
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
we have made a point to go to the
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
nursing homes uh the past year or two
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's been a little bit more difficult so
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
we'll send the absentee registration
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
packets and and all that along with the
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
absentee requests and they get help from
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
the the staff they're filling it out
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's college students that
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
just turned 18 their way at college they
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
want to vote in derry where they live
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
so they'll request the absentee
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
registration packet
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
and they'll want to vote in that
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
election too so we'll send them the
 
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.470 align:start position:0%
election too so we'll send them the
request

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
and if it's you know
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
close to the election we'll send the
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
bell too but they have to complete
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
everything everything has to be done
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
correctly if their absentee registration
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
is not done correct and the supervisors
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
reject them their bell gets rejected if
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
they send the registration but not the
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot request there's no
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
request for that belt the ballot gets
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
rejected so they still have to have
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
everything done and complete
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
and sent back to us for the ballots
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
account so we're not just sending out um
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
ballots to people um
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
they have to have everything all their
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
paperwork has to line up
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
further questions for
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair so if this bill
 
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.150 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair so if this bill
passes

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
passes
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a lot of extra work
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
for both your for the staff and for the
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
person trying to vote
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
so if this bill passes we'd have to do
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
everything in steps
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
so the first step would be if they're
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
not registered to send them the absentee
 
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.230 align:start position:0%
not registered to send them the absentee
registration

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
once they get that
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
we couldn't send the belt along with
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
anything basically so it would require a
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more mailing
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
and it might
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
make it so someone doesn't have enough
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
time depending on how close the election
 
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:33.990 align:start position:0%
time depending on how close the election
to

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
to get their belt back to us depending
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
on when they do the request
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
i mean they should be doing the request
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
with with time but people don't always
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
do that it's a few days before but if we
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
send the request with the ballot um
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
then they're able to get it back to us
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
in time
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
further question
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you um so
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
just based on your experience how much
 
00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.350 align:start position:0%
just based on your experience how much
time

00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
then should someone be requesting this
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
if they're going to go to this two-step
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
process a month
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
i would i would say the earlier the
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
better we have the forms available like
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
we have the town election coming up if
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
someone is away and they and they're not
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
going to be back we could send them the
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
absentee registration now so when
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
someone calls we always recommend
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know the earlier the the better but
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
i'd say at least a few weeks to if we're
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
going back and forth with the paperwork
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify something that
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
you said because it struck me so you
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
said you don't just send votes out to
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
just anyone
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
yours are sending ballots out to just
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
anyone because you you said
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
that if i call up your office and i say
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
hey i'm
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
you know i live in derry uh it's let's
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
say it's a week before the election
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
right yeah um
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
i i need to request an absolute ballot
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
you're going you just said you are going
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
to send me a ballot
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
yes you said that right
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
so we would send about um so if you
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
don't have a printer or you don't have a
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
way to get the application to us we
 
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.230 align:start position:0%
way to get the application to us we
would

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
in circumstances we will send a belt
 
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.350 align:start position:0%
in circumstances we will send a belt
along

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
with the application but you have to
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
complete that and we're not sending it
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
to just anyone they have to initiate a
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
contact with us so a phone call or
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
whatever to us first
 
00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:29.430 align:start position:0%
whatever to us first
requesting

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
that you know they're looking to vote in
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
that election
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's mainly for the people
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
the people that utilize it now are the
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
ones that don't have a printer or they
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
don't have a way of getting the
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
application in time there's
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
there would be no no way that they would
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
have time to vote
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
if we didn't send it brian
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
thank you uh okay so in thank you for
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
that and i have uh further question if
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
said if you go through that situation
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
and you send the ballot and the the
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
request for registration and then the
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist don't
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
accept that
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
registration there's some problem they
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
don't have the paperwork correct
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
something's going on
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
they don't have proof of residency that
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
they've sent in
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
and then they send you the absentee
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
ballot what happens to the absentee
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
ballot in that case so the absentee belt
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
would be marked as rejected
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
um and it gets stored uh with all the
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
other election materials for the 22
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
month retention period um if it's a
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
state or federal election
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
and then if it's a a town it would be
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
stored for 60 days and then disposed of
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
but it would not be
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
counted further questions from committee
 
00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:46.710 align:start position:0%
counted further questions from committee
members

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
lot so i'm going to try and keep it
 
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.470 align:start position:0%
lot so i'm going to try and keep it
brief

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
brief
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
what i think this bill does and i think
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's very very necessary
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
there are other bills out there that is
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh being considered with regards to
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
college students being able to vote
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
remotely that they can that they can
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
actually sign up to they can actually
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
request an absentee that they can
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
actually request the pro
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
process six months before
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
the election that they want to vote in
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
if they if they're going to turn 18
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
before the election day so
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
with regards to college students i don't
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
think that that's causing a problem
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
because to be honest with you with
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility with
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
with privilege comes responsibility and
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
you folks have heard a lot of problems
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
with voter integrity in our state and a
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
lot of it says they say it's because of
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
the college students i don't know i'm
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
not involved in that process however it
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
would it would
 
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.750 align:start position:0%
would it would
allow

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire that don't
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
trust our election integrity a bill like
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
this would put a little bit back in
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
their hands
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
the previous
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
speakers spoke a little bit about now
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
the town is going to
 
00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.830 align:start position:0%
the town is going to
the

00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and my town has a lot of
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and assisted livings
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
we had more people vote from app by
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot in from those facilities
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
than we ever have before now am i saying
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
there's something nefarious going on
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know i didn't do i haven't done
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
the canvassing for my town however it
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
has raised concerns
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely that i have
 
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.750 align:start position:0%
absolutely that i have
since

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
the 2020 election i have
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
people that live in some of these
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
assisted livings and nursing homes and
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
said oh i've never voted
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
and i've gone to my town hall and they
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
were registered as voting in 2020.
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's a reality now did it happen
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
from my town clerk
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
did it happen from the director of the
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know the way our laws are set up
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
is it makes transparency almost
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
impossible because we allow the director
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
of the nursing home
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
say these are all legitimate ballots
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
these are all legitimate i went down my
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
entire list of residents and requested
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
ballots for them and they signed and i
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
got the absentee ballots they filled it
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
out and i'm authorizing that they're all
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
legitimate so that's taking that's
 
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:22.950 align:start position:0%
legitimate so that's taking that's
that's

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
to me that's putting the our town clerk
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
in a bad position
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
our town clerk is now saying i have to
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
trust this director
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
this executive director that that
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
they're being honest with these ballots
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's not a good place for even the
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
best town clerk in the world to be um
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
that and now with regards to i want to
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about what also what
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
happened in my town in 2020 and i don't
 
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.470 align:start position:0%
happened in my town in 2020 and i don't
think

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
i i don't know how it happened but i
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
know i have
 
00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:56.470 align:start position:0%
know i have
one

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.149 align:start position:0%
one
undeclared

00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
undeclared
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
one democrat and one republican living
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
in my house
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
that the undeclared person
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
received an absentee ballot without
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
requesting it
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
in the primary election not the general
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
election but in the primary election
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
they received an absentee ballot with
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
with um
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh actually i think it was before it was
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
after the primary and before the general
 
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.669 align:start position:0%
after the primary and before the general
election

00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
no primary you have to declare right so
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
it was before the primary delay primary
 
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.950 align:start position:0%
it was before the primary delay primary
election

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
it was before the primary election they
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
received the application to change their
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
change their party and an absentee
 
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.750 align:start position:0%
change their party and an absentee
ballot

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
only one of the two apps and ct ballots
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
so if they chose to let's say they
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
filled out the paperwork and wanted to
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
be a democrat
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
they only received one of the two
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
ballots either a republican ballot or a
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
democrat ballot
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to get into it here
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
which one they receive but definitely
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
speaks to issues with integrity do i
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
know that came from the town absolutely
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
not i don't because it was a p.o box and
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's not the po box that our town uses
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
so again we're talking about integrity
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
of elections here in the state of new
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire we're first in the nation we
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
should be above reproach
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to election
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
integrity and i think that this one
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
little sentence right here does not
 
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.909 align:start position:0%
little sentence right here does not
prevent

00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:32.870 align:start position:0%
prevent
folks

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
from um from exercising their right
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
but it puts some responsibility and
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
integrity back into that process lastly
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
our town clerks you you heard from the
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
last representative or the last person
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
that spoke
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
that our town clerks
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
have a really hard job when they get
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
those when they get those ballots back
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
they have very limited time right now
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
this would give them more time to do
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
their job correctly
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
and i believe that there would be it
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
would be less likely to have so right
 
00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:12.470 align:start position:0%
would be less likely to have so right
now

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
you send your absentee ballot in if you
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
made a mistake your vote didn't count
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
and you never know
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
unless you know enough to go online and
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
look it up because my town's very good
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
it'll say right there did you vote in
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
this election yes or no
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
um i'll speak to the special election
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
that we had last year
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
special election we had last year in my
 
00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:35.909 align:start position:0%
special election we had last year in my
town

00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
i was out of town i asked for absentee
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
ballot i used um
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
i used a
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
service that would ensure that it was
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
mailed to me in time and mailed mail to
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
my home and then it was mailed to me
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
because i was out of town unexpectedly
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
and that i mailed it back to my town all
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
within the time period
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
when i went online
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
my vote didn't count
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
i don't know why i don't know that it
 
00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:03.590 align:start position:0%
i don't know why i don't know that it
wouldn't

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
my vote wouldn't have made a difference
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
in that special election that one if it
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
had been one vote
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
i would have made a deal about it but it
 
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.029 align:start position:0%
i would have made a deal about it but it
wasn't

00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is is that the
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
you have heard a lot from me
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of months is
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
because we need to prove
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
we have lack of trust
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
we need to we need to stop the divide
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
and come together and say
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think my town's guilty
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think my town clerk's guilty i
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
don't think i don't think my moderator's
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
guilty i don't even know if the machines
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
are guilty at some point let's put
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
integrity back in these elections a
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
little even if it's only a little bit at
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
a time and this is a good start
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
miss chester
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%

katie gargano from the secretary of
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair and members of
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is katie gargano
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm representing the secretary of
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
state's office
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh the first thing i'd like to note is i
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
was not aware of the representative's
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
intent to not send a ballot without
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
being registered first i didn't
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
i didn't read that
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
in the existing um
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
bill so i'm gonna have to check with our
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
dave scalin on how this would affect our
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
current process of doing absentee
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
ballots well we might be able to ask him
 
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.549 align:start position:0%
ballots well we might be able to ask him
yes

00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
perfect timing that he walked in the
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.990 align:start position:0%
perfect timing that he walked in the
room

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
but he knows even if he's secretary of
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
state he's going to need a pink card
 
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.350 align:start position:0%
state he's going to need a pink card
okay

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
so we were originally
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill because it
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
reinforces the existing requirements to
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
request an absentee ballot and ensures
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
that best practices are followed by our
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
town and city clerks
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
but i definitely think that
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
there may be some other
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
rsas that have to be amended to to to do
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
his full intent if he doesn't want
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
ballots sent without them being
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
registered first
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
any questions sorry representative lane
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
just to clarify sorry
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
just to clarify
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
you were the opinion that it wasn't
 
00:31:41.679 --> 00:31:43.269 align:start position:0%
you were the opinion that it wasn't
requiring

00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't prohibiting sending the
 
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.630 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't prohibiting sending the
ballot

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
correct it's written
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you in the existing law yeah it's
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
it says that you can still send a ballot
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
with the paperwork if they're not
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members

is there anybody else who wants to speak
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it's necessary i think
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
the witness just answered that
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
current law requires allows sending the
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
ballot with
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
the actual application form
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%

session on
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
hb 1496.
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just so everybody who's listening
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
know i did albeit last night let
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee know that we
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
were going to be doing this and we will
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
be taking a short break afterwards this
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
is required because of this chairs
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
failure to recognize last week that when
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
we continued discussion on this bill to
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
allow a member to make an amendment it
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
is an early bill
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
which means it needs to be reported out
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
of committee today
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
i thought i had been clever and gotten
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
everything done last week
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
so this needs to happen this morning
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
because it needs to get in the calendar
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
that's being published today for session
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:44.629 align:start position:0%
next week
so

00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
with that we have
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
1496 you have
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
also received an amendment that was the
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
reason we had continued it
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
it is amendment number 2022 634
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%

00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:10.390 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
2022-0634-h

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sweeney seconds
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes madam chairman we heard about um
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
this bill this is the bill that allowed
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
um anyone to have
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
access to the electronic copy of the
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
statewide voter database
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
from the secretary of state's office uh
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
we heard extensive debate about it
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
basically the conclusion that i came to
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
belief that i've held always is that the
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
voter list is in fact public information
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
how you vote is private the fact that
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
you vote is not
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
listening to the privacy concerns um
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's it i tried to find a middle ground
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
and a path forward so that the secretary
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
of state's office wasn't inundated with
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of requests for copies
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
of the statewide database
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
but the simple fact of the matter is
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
that the database is public you can go
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
into any town clerk's office or wherever
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
the town is hosting that voter checklist
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
and you may view that checklist
 
00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.990 align:start position:0%
and you may view that checklist
currently

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
you may also request physical copies of
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
that checklist
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
but you may not get an electronic copy
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
so what i did was a min 1496 so that any
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
registered voter of a town may request
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
the voting list from that town so they
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
do not get access to the statewide list
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
but if you are you know throughout town
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
out you are in bedford a bedford
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
registered voter may request from the
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
bedford town clerk or supervise the
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
checklist an electronic copy of the
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
bedford checklist
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
i put in certain kind of stop points so
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
that you don't have somebody submitting
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
a request you know day after day after
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
day they can only request it once per
 
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:55.910 align:start position:0%
day they can only request it once per
month

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the town clerk or moderator only has
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
to provide a checklist that is current
 
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
up until the last month so that way they
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
don't have to pull
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
a new checklist every single day
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
they can pull a checklist hypothetically
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
on the first of the month and dole that
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
checklist out for the remainder of the
 
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.670 align:start position:0%
checklist out for the remainder of the
month

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
um so that is uh that is what i i did
 
00:37:16.079 --> 00:37:16.870 align:start position:0%
um so that is uh that is what i i did
there

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
um and i'm happy to do am i allowed to
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
take questions in a second
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take to take questions or
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
the occasional grilling
 
00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.510 align:start position:0%
the occasional grilling
um

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
and i hope we pass this
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.950 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
we did have a discussion on this we did
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
hear from the
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
former dean of the house as to privacy
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
issues and a couple of other things
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote against the amendment
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
and if adopted i'll be voting against
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
par partly because
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
in some aspects the changes really
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
aren't needed
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh beginning with line seven where
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
the checklist shall be furnished as a
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
physical copy or an electro electronic
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
copy in spreadsheet form or using comma
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
separated files is existing law already
 
00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.870 align:start position:0%
separated files is existing law already
says

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
the supervisors of the checklist may
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
provide the public check checklist on
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
paper disk tape electronic transfer or
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
any other form so
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
existing language already covers this
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
this proposed amendment
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
the second objection i have is that
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
electronic lists shall be the version
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
updated within the last 31 days the
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist do not meet
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
every month
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
a voter registration form is an
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
application to be added to the checklist
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
and it's only when the supervisors of
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
the checklist actually take the action
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
to add these people's names to the
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
checklist are they added to the
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
checklist so i don't know if this is
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
going to imply or require that the
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist meet every
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
month uh so that that's kind of vague
 
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.190 align:start position:0%
month uh so that that's kind of vague
there

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
and then although i appreciate the the
 
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:58.950 align:start position:0%
and then although i appreciate the the
change

00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor of the amendment has
 
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.750 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor of the amendment has
made

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh limiting the availability of these
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
lists to uh residents of the respective
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
town or city the checklist is available
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
for public inspection in the clerk's
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
office at any time
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
i i still think it's an intrusion on a
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
person's privacy to to make this
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
available in a broader uh broader way
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
and i really don't see any need for it
 
00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:24.870 align:start position:0%
and i really don't see any need for it
um

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
i i just i just think it's invasion of
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
privacy at this point it's public
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
information anybody can view it
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it needs to be
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
distributed in electronic form
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion on the
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
floor which is
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
enough to adopt the amendment
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i would like to
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
ask the
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative barry um
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
it says here the supervisor of the
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
checklist or city or town clerk shall
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
furnish one or more physical copies or

an electronic copy in spreadsheet form
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
is that at the discretion of the
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
the supervisor checklist or clerk
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
whether they provide physical or
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
electronic or is that at the
 
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.510 align:start position:0%
electronic or is that at the
um

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
discretion of the person requesting i'm
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
not sure that i see the clarity here
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so uh lines
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
nine to ten electronic copies shall only
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
be available to residents of the
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
respective town um
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
electronic list shall be the version
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
updated um but the way i would read it
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
is the shall furnish is leaving the
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
discretion to the person requesting it's
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
clearly the intent of the bill
 
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.710 align:start position:0%
clearly the intent of the bill
that

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
and of the of the amendment that it
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
shall be up to the person requesting it
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
i i guess if you really want i i don't
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
read it like that but i guess if you if
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
you wanted to get really into the into
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
the into the legal aspect of it but no
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
definitely the the legislative intent is
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
it shall be furnished in electronic form
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
if it is requested as such
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
um also uh
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
that that um to to representative
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
bergeron's point it is not the intention
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
that they will be meeting every day
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
every 31 days it's just the most current
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
version within the last 30 days so if
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
they haven't updated it
 
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.349 align:start position:0%
they haven't updated it
then

00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion on the
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
floor which is the adoption of an
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%

654-31 roman numeral
four

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
where it says you get the the list of
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
registered voters and voter history so
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
i'm really wondering does voter history
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
is voter history included in
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
this part of the law that your bill
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
addresses um i i do not believe that it
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
is because it's the it's the copy of the
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
checklist that's publicly available so
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's the electronic version if you were
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
to walk into the town of hanover's town
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
clerk's office and look at the checklist
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
it would be the electronic version of
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.390 align:start position:0%
madam chair
representative

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
barry i mean i hear what you're saying
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
about you intended for it to be at the
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
discretion of the person making the
 
00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:50.710 align:start position:0%
discretion of the person making the
request

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that when you read it
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily what it says so my question
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
to you is do we need another amendment
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
sorry if we have time for that at this
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
point um i mean if if we need to clarify
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
it i'm happy to work with the senate on
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
it i don't want to see this go away
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm not i'm not gonna go out go die
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
on the hill of language and that's the
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
intent but i will i'm happy to fix it um
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
if that gets you on board i will commit
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
to that um and if it does need to be
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
tightened up i'm happy to do that but i
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if we have time at this point
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
further questions i will say i had an
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
amendment sent to me
 
00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.670 align:start position:0%

that's what i want and i just sent it an
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%

microphones that can be on at the same
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%

this bill
 
01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.430 align:start position:0%
this bill
is

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
is

01:04:23.039 --> 01:04:24.829 align:start position:0%
electors
are

01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
allocated from new hampshire after a
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
presidential election currently we
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
allocate all four electors
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
as a group to whoever wins the highest
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
number of votes for the president
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh this bill
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:04:46.319 --> 01:04:48.069 align:start position:0%
based on
on

01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:04:48.079 --> 01:04:49.589 align:start position:0%
on
proportion

01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
proportion
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
of votes
 
01:04:51.119 --> 01:04:52.829 align:start position:0%
of votes
for

01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
candidates uh it's
 
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.910 align:start position:0%
candidates uh it's
and

01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
based on this
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
most likely
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
every presidential election
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
two votes would go to the republican and
 
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
two votes would go to the democrat
 
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.390 align:start position:0%
two votes would go to the democrat
because

01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
we're fairly evenly split
 
01:05:10.799 --> 01:05:12.150 align:start position:0%
we're fairly evenly split
and

01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
usually there's not a
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
significant third party or independent
 
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.750 align:start position:0%
significant third party or independent
candidate

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.829 align:start position:0%
 
hypothetical

01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
hypothetical
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
strong third party or uh
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
independent candidate such as
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
ross perot or
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
john anderson or a few of the others
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
in this case candidates a b and c
 
01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.309 align:start position:0%
in this case candidates a b and c
getting

01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
44 43 and 13 respectively
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
this formula gives
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
1.76 which rounds up to two votes
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
b at 43 percent gets 1.72 which rounds
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
up the two vote and c gets 13
 
01:06:04.559 --> 01:06:05.190 align:start position:0%
up the two vote and c gets 13
or

01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
at 13 gets 0.52 which rounds up to one
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
vote which adds up to five so
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
then the instruction on line 12
 
01:06:13.359 --> 01:06:15.109 align:start position:0%
then the instruction on line 12
um

01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
takes away the a vote from the second
 
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
highest vote getter
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
which then results in a having two votes
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
b having one vote and c having one vote
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
and in this particular case the
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
candidate who is almost tied for first
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
place loses a vote while the distant
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
beginning on line 24 with if complaints
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
are filed attesting to voter fraud
 
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
i think that suggests that two or more
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
complaints would require the senate to
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
begin public hearings
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
suggest two as a minimum since the word
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
complaints is pluralized
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
and it should be easy enough to get
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
two complaints in any election in the
 
01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.029 align:start position:0%
two complaints in any election in the
state

01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much and and
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on 1324 is david
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
is that for all committee members
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
you have to push it so that the red
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
shows in the microphone thank you thank
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
you madam chair members of the committee
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
i'm david scanlon secretary of state and
 
01:07:53.119 --> 01:07:54.069 align:start position:0%
i'm david scanlon secretary of state and
uh

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
alvin c just did a great job giving my
 
01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.910 align:start position:0%
alvin c just did a great job giving my
testimony

01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.950 align:start position:0%
testimony
so

01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
i am going to be very brief um right now
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
four electoral votes are a prize
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
to whichever presidential candidate
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
happens to win new hampshire
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
in the general election
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
if house bill 1324 were to pass
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
unless a candidate won by a landslide in
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
but both candidates would effectively
 
01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
both candidates of the major political
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
parties would effectively get the same
 
01:08:30.159 --> 01:08:30.950 align:start position:0%
parties would effectively get the same
two

01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.749 align:start position:0%
two
uh

01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
electoral votes each
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
and if that were to happen there would
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
be really little incentive for a
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
candidate to come to new hampshire and
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
campaign here because
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
the outcome is
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
there there
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
could be an instance as alvin c
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned where there would be a strong
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
third party candidate
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
that could actually
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know by winning
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
13 14 15 percent
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
of the votes in new hampshire claim an
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
electoral vote
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
and actually take take that vote away
 
01:09:06.159 --> 01:09:07.510 align:start position:0%
and actually take take that vote away
from

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
the second place candidate
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
who might have a very strong showing
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
um and you know i think you have to
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
question the fairness
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
of that happening
 
01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.309 align:start position:0%
of that happening
um

01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
what i passed around was simply uh an
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
example very similar to the one that
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
alvin c gave of uh
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
playing out the formula that is in the
 
01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.030 align:start position:0%
playing out the formula that is in the
statute

01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh and you can see the same results
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
on this example that he gave in his
 
01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:36.789 align:start position:0%
on this example that he gave in his
testimony

01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%

01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire being very unique
 
01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.630 align:start position:0%
new hampshire being very unique
having

01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
each town having its own government and
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
having such a large legislative body we
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
find that we have a great need for
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
several candidates and sometimes a very
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
small pool of people that wish to
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
perform those
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
history has shown that we have several
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
elected officials that often perform
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
more than one role
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
this bill was intended to solve the
 
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
this bill was intended to solve the
concern

01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
on election day to secure that everybody
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
is essentially following the same rules
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
our town moderator for i'm sorry our
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
school moderator for several years over
 
01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:39.590 align:start position:0%
school moderator for several years over
10

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
10
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
was also a state representative
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
he always would go out get a lawn chair
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
sit outside kind of mingle with
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
everybody else i thought that was the
 
01:12:50.159 --> 01:12:51.590 align:start position:0%
everybody else i thought that was the
law

01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
so imagine my surprise
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
last year when i was running in five
 
01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:56.870 align:start position:0%
last year when i was running in five
towns

01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
to find out the one of
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
my actual opponent
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
was actually a moderator and was inside
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
all day
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
then i was told that not only was he
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
inside all day but he was actually
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
escorting some people to the curtain
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
with phrases like let's make sure you
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
know who you're voting for today
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
now i recognize that that probably
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen with every single town or
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
school moderator but the fact of the
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
matter is everybody says that it doesn't
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
happen until it does
 
01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.510 align:start position:0%
happen until it does
so

01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
this has come to my attention that
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
there's been several bills over the
 
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
years that have been presented to
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
address this however none of them have
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
ever passed so that tells me that
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
obviously there is a concern
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
i also am not the only representative
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
that wrote
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
similar bills like this um
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
the reason mine is the one that you're
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
hearing today is because i was first
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
my town clerk um
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with me over his
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
concern of the language and this was
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
before the bill was actually finished
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
and he explained that he's actually
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
elected to run the election and that
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
somebody does have to run the election
 
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
so before everything was finalized i
 
01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.750 align:start position:0%
so before everything was finalized i
talked

01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
talked
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
with ols and asked him to please
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
exclude the clerk
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
because i heard his concerns
 
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.510 align:start position:0%
because i heard his concerns
however

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
imagine my surprise when i found out
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire municipal association
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
had this bill as the number one bill of
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
the season to kill
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
so with that i had a conversation with
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
and i do think that it was actually
 
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
a very productive one
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
so during our conversation we came to
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that really what i was
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
trying to say is if a person is in a
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
contested race
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
i believe that they should have to
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
follow the same rules as everybody else
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
i also was under
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
given a little bit of an education that
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
the moderators and i'm sure i will be
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
corrected if i am wrong
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
most of their duties do occur on the
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
your deliberative sessions and yes they
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
do perform work on election day i'm not
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
saying that they don't
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
however i also believe that we that you
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
are able to have backup moderators
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
you're also able to have volunteers so
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
after my discussion with the new
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association it came
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
to one of their biggest concerns was the
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
lack of volunteers
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
and i found it a really little bit
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
discouraging to think that something
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
that could potentially be a really good
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
may be opposed because of lack of
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
volunteers when the fact is that the
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
moderators have never really had to get
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
a volunteer so we don't really know
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
right now that that is a problem
 
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
so we did come to what i believe is a
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
compromise and we do have an amendment
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
that you all have that basically says
 
01:15:36.239 --> 01:15:37.030 align:start position:0%
that you all have that basically says
that

01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
if the con if the race is a contested
 
01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.270 align:start position:0%
if the con if the race is a contested
race

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
race
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
that is where basically everybody will
 
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
follow the same rules be outside behind
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
the line
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
however sitting here with mr graves um
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
he's actually now thinking that all
 
01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:52.870 align:start position:0%
he's actually now thinking that all
right

01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
mr graves can testify for himself okay
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
he's going to i know i know he's here
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll let nhma say what um
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to say thank you madam
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
chairman so um basically
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
where i was going from that was the
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
conversation we had i was going to ask
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
if you would let him please have that
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
conversation instead of asking me to
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
address that
 
01:16:14.239 --> 01:16:15.270 align:start position:0%
address that
um

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
and that is pretty much
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
i do believe that this is a happy
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
compromise for a solution to the problem
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative does anybody
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
have any questions for representative
 
01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.390 align:start position:0%
have any questions for representative
rhodes

01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
rhodes
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
my question is regarding um selectmen
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
specifically elected in like the city of
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
manchester when their sole position is
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
to run the election
 
01:16:44.159 --> 01:16:45.669 align:start position:0%
to run the election
um

01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
i understand the clerk the clerk
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
position but have you thought about also
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
removing the position of selectmen from
 
01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.350 align:start position:0%
removing the position of selectmen from
um

01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
this bill because that's their only job
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
is to do that is to count votes
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.870 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
i think where a lot of the confusion
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
comes in is a lot of towns have
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
their own rules when it comes to
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
election day
 
01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.310 align:start position:0%
election day
our

01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
our five selectmen if they are on the
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
ballot they actually do get volunteers
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
for the day and they don't work inside
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
the polls
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
all right just for clarification for so
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
everybody is aware um like
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes i come from a town
 
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
and we have selectmen um but cities also
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
have selectmen and they're only ju
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
they're elected by ward and truly their
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
only function
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
run the election on election day there
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
are other staff who do other things so i
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
think that's what representative
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
alexander was referring to follow-up
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative alexander um thank you
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair that's exactly what i was
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
referring to that the the definition of
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
selectmen in a town like goffstown is
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
far different than the definition of
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
further questions there was one
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you uh
 
01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.270 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you uh
representative

01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
were you aware that part second article
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
32 of the new hampshire constitution
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
states that the moderator in the
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
presence of the selectmen and the clerk
 
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
shall conduct elections
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it also be a second part of
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
that isn't your
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
bill therefore
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
possibly unconstitutional by trying to
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
restrict these elected officials from
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
performing the duties
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
given to them under our state
 
01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.470 align:start position:0%
given to them under our state
constitution

01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question my my
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
intention is certainly not to go against
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution i do
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
believe that we would all say that
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of questions
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
surrounding election lately and what is
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
fair and what is not fair and i believe
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
that if you have a person that is on the
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
ballot and they're standing inside the
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
election the actual election place
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
and they're shaking hands with people
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
and introducing themselves when
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
everybody else is outside behind the
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
line i just don't think that that's an
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
equal playing field
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative lane did i see your hand
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
that was your question all right further
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.189 align:start position:0%
 
c9

01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
c9
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative hamer
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
would you believe in manchester alone
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
there would be at least 176
 
01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.790 align:start position:0%
there would be at least 176
volunteer

01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
elected positions
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated during an election in
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
manchester alone
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i live in a
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
town that has four thousand people i do
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
not live in a city
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
so i do not know what takes place in the
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
city election
 
01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:34.630 align:start position:0%
city election
so

01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
who would be running a follow-up
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
question a follow-up who would be
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
running manchester's elections if these
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
people are on the ballot
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up question i
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
believe they you do have town clerks
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
you do have selectmen and you do have
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
moderators not every single person
 
01:19:59.630 --> 01:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
576 of them are
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
in contested races yes
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
well i think it's it's very unfortunate
 
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
for the people that that are standing
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
outside if there's 176 people that are
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
inside working the ballot and also on it
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
so i i i i share representative
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
bergeron's concern about article 30 can
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
you get a little closer to the mic i
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're getting picked up
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say that generally i'm sort
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
of having a hard time hearing people in
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
the room and i'm sure that people are
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
having a hard time picking up the
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
amplification so i i share
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron's concern about
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
article 32 because it says the election
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
shall be governed by the moderator um
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
we've we've talked about
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
the what i believe in this my question i
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
believe is the intent of your bill is
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
you don't want people
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
unfairly campaigning or receiving a leg
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
up that are also basically using their
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
position as an election worker to
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
get the last the last
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
pass out of voter if you will before
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
they go that's that's what you're trying
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
to get at right thank you representative
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
barry that that is exactly and i would
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
like to really stress to you all that
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
that there are town there are moderators
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
that i know for a fact that have sat out
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
of the election while they were also on
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
the ballot so if they were you know
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
running for state representative they're
 
01:21:24.159 --> 01:21:25.189 align:start position:0%
running for state representative they're
also

01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
the moderator they would set out that
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
election and i did talk to several
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
moderators and
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
several of them said to me well this
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
bill isn't necessary because so and so
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
already does sit out
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
and then i would explain that well not
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
further questions representative lane
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
so so i am from a city not from a town
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
so but
 
01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.390 align:start position:0%
so but
um

01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that a moderator can
 
01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.470 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that a moderator can
govern

01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
govern
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
without being physically present
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
so govern the the voting process and
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
govern the election without physically
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
being there
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
when i had the discussion with the
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
moderators i spoke to they told me that
 
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
when they were not actually working in
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
the election that day that they had
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
somebody that replaced them either an
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
assistant moderator or they had another
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
volunteer for the day and they actually
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
are there they were just outside
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
further question
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh one other question as i read it i
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
noticed that
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
it's just selectmen inspector is there
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
any reason about is it any candidate so
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
like if i'm running on the ballot
 
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
could i volunteer as a poll worker
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
am i going to be prohibited from working
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
as a poll
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
to help my town because a lot of reps do
 
01:22:50.639 --> 01:22:51.510 align:start position:0%
to help my town because a lot of reps do
that

01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
and again in in my town in the towns
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
that i've spoken to if you are on the
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
actual ballot that day you are not
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
inside working on the at the polls and i
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
will say that's the case in my town and
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
most of the towns i know that if you're
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
on the ballot you are not working the
 
01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.669 align:start position:0%
on the ballot you are not working the
poll

01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
so i never know whether people are
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
really being genuine when they tell me
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
not to run because they want me to work
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
the election or whether they just really
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to see me on the ballot
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative perez
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i i want to say i'm coming
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
from a town as well and then um
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
if you're on the ballot you're not
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
allowed to to volunteer as well right
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative hamer sorry i did see you
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
before hi representative rhodes when you
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
said your moderator escorted people to
 
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
the voting booths
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
and they were talking
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
isn't that called electioneering
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i do believe
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
so that shouldn't have been
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct that should
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
see none thank you thank you for your
 
01:24:05.679 --> 01:24:07.669 align:start position:0%
see none thank you thank you for your
time

01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
i'm tina gilford i'm the town and school
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
moderator in derry
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
i'm really glad that someone brought up
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
the constitution
 
01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.629 align:start position:0%
the constitution
because

01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
it is the moderator who governs an
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
election not a clerk
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
and this bill basically takes the
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
moderator's duties and tries to hand
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
them off to the clerk because the clerk
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
can be inside but the moderator can't
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
i do understand
 
01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.189 align:start position:0%
i do understand
that

01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
no one wants electioneering to go on
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
and i do understand that not everyone is
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
me i get that because i don't do it
 
01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.390 align:start position:0%
me i get that because i don't do it
um

01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
and i think anyone who is on the ballot
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
definitely cannot handle a marked ballot
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
should not be counting ballots
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
i have i have no problem with those
 
01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.189 align:start position:0%
i have i have no problem with those
things

01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
but there are other duties during the
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
day um so for example in derry
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
we have some we have what's called
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
they are people who have gone to court
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
and have a court order
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
to have their name hidden from the
 
01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.390 align:start position:0%
to have their name hidden from the
checklist

01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
those absentee ballots are to be
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
processed by the moderator and the clerk
 
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
i do not feel comfortable handing those
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
kind of duties to anyone
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm elected to do is to do
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
the job of the moderator
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
i've been in front of you recently
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
testifying that you know you want to
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
come after an elected official someone
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
who's put their name on the ballot and
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
be responsible for what goes on on
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
election day and i had no problem with
 
01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.510 align:start position:0%
election day and i had no problem with
that

01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
but you guys are now saying you know
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
this bill says so you're just going to
 
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
hand the whole process off to somebody
 
01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:22.950 align:start position:0%
hand the whole process off to somebody
else

01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
and you have to be outside
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
because the lower part of this bill
 
01:26:28.639 --> 01:26:30.790 align:start position:0%
because the lower part of this bill
um

01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know with the only the exception
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
who does not run the election
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
uh basically says unless you're casting
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
your own vote you're required to be
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
outside because the rsa that's
 
01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.669 align:start position:0%
outside because the rsa that's
referenced

01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
is the rsa that sets the no
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
electioneering in the preferred
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
electioneering zone outside
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
any member of the public can go to any
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
polling place on election day
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
and can go in and observe from the
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
public observation area
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
obviously except if
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
this pertains to you because it sounds
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
i think people elect
 
01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
their moderators their clerks their
 
01:27:21.189 --> 01:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
to do their job
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
and while you can appoint someone to
 
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.510 align:start position:0%
and while you can appoint someone to
assist

01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
assist
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
they don't know the ins and outs of rsa
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
they don't know how to quickly look them
 
01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.110 align:start position:0%
they don't know how to quickly look them
up

01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
trust me voters don't want to wait if
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's any kind of
 
01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:39.750 align:start position:0%
there's any kind of
issue

01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
they want it handled they want to come
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
in they want to vote they want to leave
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
they want to be there less than 15
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
minutes um
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
i i do think
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
if there are people glad handing in a
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
polling place that to me would fall
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
under electioneering
 
01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.470 align:start position:0%
under electioneering
and

01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:59.669 --> 01:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
that would be an issue that you know
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
bring it to the attention of the
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
attorney general there there are
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
electioneering laws already on the books
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
use them
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
um i i think that
 
01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.149 align:start position:0%
um i i think that
most

01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
most people are doing the right thing
 
01:28:13.679 --> 01:28:14.550 align:start position:0%
most people are doing the right thing
but

01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
the moderator is the one who runs the
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
election not the clerk and that's in our
 
01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:21.430 align:start position:0%
election not the clerk and that's in our
constitution

01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions

01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
you couldn't be present whether
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
this legislation passed or for some
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
other reason
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
could could
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
one of those or a combination of some of
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
the assistants run the election in your
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%

very very
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh insightful questions
 
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
i want to cut down to a little bit of an
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
anecdotal thing
 
01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
in my town a friend of mine was running
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh for city council
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
and i was going to help him out and
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
stand with him outside
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
the polling place so we got to the
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
polling place and i see his opponent
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
standing outside
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
all nice and dressed up and everything
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
and then i see his opponent go inside
 
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.189 align:start position:0%
and then i see his opponent go inside
now

01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:30:29.199 --> 01:30:29.990 align:start position:0%
now
what

01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
what struck me incredibly wrong about
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
this is my father
 
01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:37.189 align:start position:0%
this is my father
um

01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.199 --> 01:30:38.629 align:start position:0%
 
earlier

01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
in the year or a couple years ago when
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
he went in to go and vote for me for
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
this position
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
he was turned away because he had a
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
but yet
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
this gentleman could stand inside
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
what better
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
advertising is there then while you're
 
01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.669 align:start position:0%
advertising is there then while you're
inside

01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
inside
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
it's an unfair advantage it shouldn't be
 
01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:09.750 align:start position:0%
it's an unfair advantage it shouldn't be
allowed

01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
the problem with it is not
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
somebody doing their job elections come
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
along every couple of couple of years
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
every four years
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
you can plan for this this is not a
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
really big deal
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
if you're worried about
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
any kind of election problems which
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
we've had or the perception of this
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
stuff the person who's running should
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
not be in the room that the election is
 
01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:35.750 align:start position:0%
not be in the room that the election is
happening

01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
go to a different ward go to i mean
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
there's got to be other remedies there's
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
got to be other things it's just not a
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
great look it doesn't serve anybody and
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
it casts doubt on our election process
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
so my uh my whole purpose here is just
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
to support this i like the amendment
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
i like the bill itself whichever way you
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
decided to go i would i would definitely
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
be in support of and if you have any
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
other questions i'd be happy to answer
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%

association
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
we oppose this bill
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
most of our reasons were covered
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
by my town moderator tina gilford
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
i don't want to run an election without
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
our moderator she's the one
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
that knows
 
01:33:01.679 --> 01:33:02.709 align:start position:0%
that knows
the

01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
the most
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
about what's going on that day
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
we worked really well as a team and i
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
don't want her to be sitting outside not
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
even allowed in the building
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
on the day of the election just because
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
her name's on the ballot i believe
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
if anyone has concerns about someone
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
working the election and being on the
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
ballot if they've seen things
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's they can report them for
 
01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
electioneering if they believe they're
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
doing something improper inside
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
i don't believe they should be banned
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're elected by the people in the
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
town or the city to do that job the
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
people in the town have the confidence
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
in them to do that job
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
and this bill making it so they can't do
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
what they are elected to do
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
is not something that we can support um
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
so i'd be open to any questions thank
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
you questions for mr healey
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative terozian thank you madam
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
chair thank you mr healey for taking the
 
01:33:58.719 --> 01:33:59.990 align:start position:0%
chair thank you mr healey for taking the
question

01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:02.470 align:start position:0%
do you
um

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
believe that the current law that
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
requires um candidates
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
just regular candidates not town clerks
 
01:34:12.149 --> 01:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
or moderators
 
01:34:12.159 --> 01:34:13.030 align:start position:0%
or moderators
to

01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that they don't election air or
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
or campaign
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
during election that they're required to
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
be in a separate spot away from the
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
voters do you think that is a good law
 
01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:26.550 align:start position:0%
voters do you think that is a good law
yes

01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:27.510 align:start position:0%
yes
follow-up

01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
so help me understand how you reconcile
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
somebody that's on the ballot being able
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
to be inside of the guide rail in that
 
01:34:34.719 --> 01:34:35.910 align:start position:0%
to be inside of the guide rail in that
then

01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
so for example our town moderator a town
 
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
water is elected by the people
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
of the town they put the confidence in
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
the town moderator to perform the job in
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
an unbiased way
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
in the current law now at the end of the
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
night when we're on the ballot we don't
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
handle the marked ballots
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
and i believe that's a good solution
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
we do our job throughout the day
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of the night
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
they're not near any any of the marked
 
01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.030 align:start position:0%
they're not near any any of the marked
ballots

01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
i have a question mr haley is that not
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
handling of the ballots
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
your decision your moderator's decision
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's the marked ballots only so we can
 
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
pass out
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
um the blank ballots before
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%

01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and nate grace for
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
we do oppose the bill as written and
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
just to be clear we do oppose the
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
amendment although i do want to thank
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
the sponsor for being willing to work
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
with me
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
um to try to come to a compromise on the
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
amendment i think that's probably as
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
close as we were we're going to be able
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
to come
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
i certainly sympathize with the sponsor
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
and representative huff's concerns about
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
the last person
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
that a voter will see in the
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh in the polling place may also be a
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
candidate for office in a contested
 
01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:19.590 align:start position:0%
candidate for office in a contested
election

01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
um but we do oppose the the bill um and
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
we oppose it for the reasons you've
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
you've already heard today i don't want
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
to prolong this hearing so i'm happy to
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:32.550 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
questions

01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairs so
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
putting aside the constitutional issue
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
could you
 
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
go through why you oppose it sorry to
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
make you do it but i would just really
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
like to know why the association opposes
 
01:36:45.679 --> 01:36:46.390 align:start position:0%
like to know why the association opposes
it

01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
sure so the uh
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
the election statutes are quite complex
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
and the role that everyone
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
everyone has in uh running the election
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
very clearly defined and litigated over
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
the years
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
and of course
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
our major one of our major reasons is
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
that it's very hard to find volunteers
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
in a place like manchester you know
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
you're looking at replacing 172 i think
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
it was individuals
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
for the election
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's going to be very difficult
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
to find those people um we've certainly
 
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:20.870 align:start position:0%
to find those people um we've certainly
heard

01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:21.590 align:start position:0%
heard
and

01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
i can say from personal experience i
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
know that they're they're open positions
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
in in my warden have been for years
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
where i live
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
um and it's just incredibly difficult to
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
find people um and we certainly
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
understand the concern we want to make
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
sure that elections are are done with
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
integrity um
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
but it's uh we don't think that
 
01:37:43.679 --> 01:37:45.109 align:start position:0%
but it's uh we don't think that
um

01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:45.119 --> 01:37:46.709 align:start position:0%
um
there

01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
that there is an issue here
 
01:37:55.590 --> 01:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
representative teresian thank you madam
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank you sir for taking the
 
01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.830 align:start position:0%
chair thank you sir for taking the
question

01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.550 align:start position:0%
question
so

01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:03.669 align:start position:0%
so
don't

01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
don't you think we're sending a
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
potentially conflicting message to
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
voters that we say
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
for good reason
 
01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:11.669 align:start position:0%
for good reason
candidates

01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
that are on the ballot can't be in that
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
position but if you're one of
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
the individuals in one of those
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
positions you can be isn't that
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know i think i think dealing with um
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
the issues of
 
01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.750 align:start position:0%
the issues of
uh

01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
who voters are last to see in a
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
contested race is is a difficult um
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
policy choice um
 
01:38:39.189 --> 01:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's one that uh
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
i mean the reality is
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
our state has so many elected positions
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
we already have a strong law against
 
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
electioneering that
 
01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:49.510 align:start position:0%
electioneering that
it

01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think it merits a change to the
 
01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:54.709 align:start position:0%
i don't think it merits a change to the
law

01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
thank you so as a follow-up
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
if you feel the electioneering laws are
 
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
strong enough then why not let everybody
 
01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:03.830 align:start position:0%
strong enough then why not let everybody
um

01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
well only the people who are election
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
officials are allowed to run the
 
01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:14.310 align:start position:0%
officials are allowed to run the
election

01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
unless i'm misunderstanding the question
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
well let me clarify if i may so
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
i heard your answer that
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's a we have electioneering laws so
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's sufficient for say a town clerk
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
or a town moderator that's that's inside
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
the guide rail if you will
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
so if you feel comfortable with that why
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
not allow other candidates be inside the
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
well because only the people running the
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
election are allowed inside the guard
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
rail to make sure that they're going to
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
run the election properly
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
further questions follow let me ask a
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up to representative derozan to
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:39:50.719 --> 01:39:52.629 align:start position:0%
sort of
um

01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
following up on what he said
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we allow candidates to
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
stand inside the polling place outside
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
the guardrail because you're certainly
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
entitled to observe
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
as a resident of the community what goes
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
on you let the moderator know that's
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
what you're doing you go stand and you
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
watch so why wouldn't we why then are we
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
if there's a candidate inside the rails
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
why can't we have a candidate standing
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.109 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's a policy decision um for
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:32.229 align:start position:0%
the legislature
um

01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
certainly it has been long-standing
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
tradition and we've seen that candidates
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
who are electioneering are
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
outside in the designated area
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
outside the polls um there is the
 
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
ability for the public to observe
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
presumably if a candidate didn't want to
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know wear paraphernalia that had
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
their name on it or slogan or anything
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
that would be barred by the
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
electioneering statutes presumably they
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
could go in and sit and watch the
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
election like any other member of the
 
01:40:58.239 --> 01:41:00.229 align:start position:0%
election like any other member of the
public

01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you also signed up to
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
speak on this is
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
um this is a really important bill for
 
01:41:23.669 --> 01:41:23.679 align:start position:0%
me personally for the town that i live
 
01:41:23.679 --> 01:41:24.470 align:start position:0%
me personally for the town that i live
in

01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh there is current
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
currently some issues with regards to
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
how our elections were run in 2020
 
01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
missing ballots absentee ballots
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh a number of other things
 
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
and there were some people in the
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
elected positions
 
01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:44.149 align:start position:0%
elected positions
that

01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
i knew before this time and i witnessed
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
them inside because they've been running
 
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
for years and years and years and most
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
of the time unopposed they are inside
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
and they and they do cause because i
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
know them by face if they're the ones
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
checking off whether i'm whether i'm
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
how i'm voting like they're if they're
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
if they're standing on the exit and i'm
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
putting my machine in
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
and they tell me that i have to put it
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
in face up that's creating a chilling
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
effect on me because i know that's
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
what's gonna happen and i know that
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's gonna be my um my uh let's say
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
my um
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
town clerk is sitting there and she's on
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
the ballot
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
and she's at the exit
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
and she's gonna know if i left because
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
most the time in my town these folks are
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
running unopposed
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
not by choice but because our town does
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
not seem to want to have the
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
transparency that i'm hearing that um
 
01:42:49.590 --> 01:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
even manchester seems to have and dairy
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
seems to have more transparency
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
we were not allowed as what we should
 
01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
have been allowed but because we don't
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
because i did not know that the town
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
clerk is responsible for providing me
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
with everybody who is running for the
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
election in on march 8th
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
i did not know that that's public
 
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
information and that she had to give it
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
so when i asked if certain people were
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
running unopposed because i felt
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
strongly that we needed if someone was
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
running unopposed i was going to run
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
against them because of integrity issues
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
that are currently being investigated by
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
based on that
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
i was not provided that information i
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
didn't know enough to turn around and
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
say it's a requirement you have to tell
 
01:43:39.199 --> 01:43:39.990 align:start position:0%
say it's a requirement you have to tell
me

01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
so i am on the ballot but i'm on the
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
ballot for a position
 
01:43:44.159 --> 01:43:45.030 align:start position:0%
ballot for a position
that

01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
i would have been on the ballot for a
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
different position had i known that one
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the persons that i personally have
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
integrity issues with is on the ballot
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
running unopposed um the bottom line is
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
is the way
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
i don't see a huge problem with
 
01:44:00.159 --> 01:44:01.510 align:start position:0%
i don't see a huge problem with
volunteers

01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue for me is this is our
 
01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:04.629 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue for me is this is our
vote

01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
i mean this is this is important and i
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
can't understand why an elected official
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
or or a candidate would want to be put
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
in that position where they may have
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
integrity issues or people believe that
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be trusted
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
to this day i don't know if the people
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
that are being investigated by the
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office made mistakes
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
if there was something nefarious or if
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
it was even had anything to do with my
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
town officials
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is is that even in a
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
city like manchester she says is 176
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
volunteers just change wards they're so
 
01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:45.910 align:start position:0%
volunteers just change wards they're so
close

01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
close
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
i can tell you i witnessed i didn't even
 
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
know what electioneering was
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
but in 2020 i witnessed it in multiple
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
awards in manchester
 
01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:56.390 align:start position:0%
awards in manchester
um

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
and but i didn't know it at the time
 
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
because all i was doing was driving
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
folks to there and some of them were
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
elderly um or disabled so all i did was
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
drive them to their ward go in with them
 
01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:09.270 align:start position:0%
drive them to their ward go in with them
and

01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:10.550 align:start position:0%
and
and

01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
basically give them the information
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
this is how you you know this is how you
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
go through the process um
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
i saw electioneering happening i saw it
 
01:45:23.590 --> 01:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
happening so
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't know these elderly folks didn't
 
01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:27.109 align:start position:0%
i didn't know these elderly folks didn't
know

01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
but they have the right for the they
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
have the right not to be silenced
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
they have the right not to be
 
01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.189 align:start position:0%
they have the right not to be
manipulated

01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
manipulated
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
and this bill allows that it gives our
 
01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:39.669 align:start position:0%
and this bill allows that it gives our
voters

01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
integrity it gives our voters voters
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
they are not going to be coerced or
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
manipulated it also in my opinion gives
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
our candidates
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
something to say there absolutely was
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
nothing bad going on because i wasn't
 
01:45:57.679 --> 01:46:00.470 align:start position:0%
nothing bad going on because i wasn't
involved

01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you does anybody have any
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative hamer thank you for
 
01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:10.840 align:start position:0%

176. volunteers in manchester were
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
assigned to our awards which we live in
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
we can't be going from ward to ward to
 
01:46:20.239 --> 01:46:21.109 align:start position:0%
we can't be going from ward to ward to
work

01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be on the ballot
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%

volunteers

01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh volunteers that go into the
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
go that are right now are currently
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%

01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative hamer i'm not sure it was
 
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
a question i i think and i'm doing a
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
little representative floor action did
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
you understand that in cities where
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
someone has volunteered to work an award
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
they must volunteer in the ward in which
 
01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
they reside and may not be simply
 
01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
flipped to other wards to work
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
regardless of how close they are
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions for
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
miss chester from the committee
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative for clarifying that for
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
me thank you i would i would just like
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
if you believe as i do
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
that most people who go to vote have
 
01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
already made up their mind they knew who
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
the candidate is and they walked by the
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
excellent electioneering section with
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
their eyes focused which would be why
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
the moderator in goffstown has always
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
made us stand at the end of the driveway
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
where people can aim for us with their
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
cars not their hands
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%

presented to us by a group of
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
constituents that we share who had a
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
desire to clarify the voter registration
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
process and establish a provisional
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
ballot process in order that we may have
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
more confidence in the integrity of our
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
elections it's the overall objective we
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
all want
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
specifically ensuring that only those
 
01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
people who are legally allowed to vote
 
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire are registering and
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
subsequently voting in our elections and
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
that people are voting in the proper
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
places as well
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%

01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%

people uh to answer those questions the
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
specifics about it would be the actual
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%

the committee might have
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
that's all right why don't we deal with
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
that if for purposes of presenting it
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%

with all the paperwork in front of you
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
um all right mr rivers if you want to
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
come up uh because it's um
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
a little unusual that i've got no
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor that apparently can speak to the
 
01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:05.669 align:start position:0%
sponsor that apparently can speak to the
bill

01:52:05.669 --> 01:52:05.679 align:start position:0%

01:52:05.679 --> 01:52:06.790 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
though of course we earlier had a bill
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
that this we had no sponsor so
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
um we're trying to sort of do this as we
 
01:52:14.239 --> 01:52:15.910 align:start position:0%
um we're trying to sort of do this as we
can

01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:16.950 align:start position:0%

the the reason for the bill and the
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
purpose is is that
 
01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
our small towns

i have many examples here from
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
our attorney general
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%

01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
husband down in massachusetts and decide

she just claimed that we know that
 
01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
because we're our
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
neighbors anyways
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
moving on to the bill
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
we thought
 
01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:42.310 align:start position:0%
we thought
that

01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
rather than send complaint after
 
01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:46.229 align:start position:0%
rather than send complaint after
complaint

01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
we thought that we could introduce
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
at the registration
 
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
a system of checks and balances
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:54:58.080 --> 01:54:59.669 align:start position:0%
for example
in

01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire once you register to
 
01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
vote you're clearing you're declaring
 
01:55:03.599 --> 01:55:04.550 align:start position:0%
vote you're clearing you're declaring
yourself

01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
domicile resident
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
once you do that
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
there are certain things that you have
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
to do the
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle laws in the state
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
require that you register your motor
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle and also
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
provide a license
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
all we're doing in the bill
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
balance between the two
 
01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
also it introduces the checks and
 
01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
balance on for example on page four
 
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
of the our introduce bill
 
01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:39.270 align:start position:0%

01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
before that but the what where what
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
we're saying is that they're telling
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
them that within 60 days they have to
 
01:56:00.639 --> 01:56:01.430 align:start position:0%
them that within 60 days they have to
get

01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:02.950 align:start position:0%
get
licensed

01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
and and register their vehicles
 
01:56:06.239 --> 01:56:07.030 align:start position:0%
and and register their vehicles
they

01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
it also says
 
01:56:12.149 --> 01:56:12.159 align:start position:0%
tells the clerk to follow up with the
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles
 
01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
and they are to confirm that those
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
people now we are also introducing this
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
for provisional ballots
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
the provisional ballots are required
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
because it takes time to verify people
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
show up last minute within a few days
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
they can go down register to vote any
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
any time they want because our attorney
 
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
general has told them that they can do
 
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
that they can they can just say make up
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
any story that they want
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
and become a registered voter in the
 
01:56:49.599 --> 01:56:50.870 align:start position:0%
and become a registered voter in the
state

01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
it it
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
there's no checks and balances so we're
 
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that the uh
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
registration creates those checks and
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
balances as it goes through
 
01:57:02.639 --> 01:57:03.830 align:start position:0%
balances as it goes through
um

01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's what i have to do have some more
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
and esteemed members of the committee
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
my name is dave rivers i live in
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
thornton a town next door to campton
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
a person i respect once said what you
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
need to vote in new hampshire is a new
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire state of mind
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
we think that's a little uh
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
an exaggeration but uh the the purpose
 
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
of what what it is that we're doing is
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
to tighten up our voter registration
 
01:57:39.679 --> 01:57:40.790 align:start position:0%
to tighten up our voter registration
process

01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
in hopes of introducing clarity
 
01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
and certainty where historically these
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
two characteristics have been missing
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
as evidenced by the
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state uh supreme court
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh declaring uh the
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
predecessor of the the bill prior to
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
this or the rsa prior to this is
 
01:58:00.239 --> 01:58:02.070 align:start position:0%
this or the rsa prior to this is
unconstitutional

01:58:02.070 --> 01:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
because the
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh wording was uh incomprehensible
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
so there's obviously a need and the need
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
has been confirmed by the new hampshire
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
supreme court uh briefly the goal is to
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
give everybody a ballot
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that they fill out the
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
registration form completely and
 
01:58:20.639 --> 01:58:21.910 align:start position:0%
registration form completely and
accurately

01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
accurately
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
and again the issue of time is my
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
partner here ned has mentioned
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh if we have same-day registration in
 
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
high volumes
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
i've never worked this but i can see and
 
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
i've observed that it's somewhat chaotic
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
and the ability to verify
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
at that point in time
 
01:58:39.119 --> 01:58:41.350 align:start position:0%
at that point in time
is

01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's difficult so
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
our process is
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
come in
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
if we can't validate your registration
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
and we've completed a very thorough
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
completion of the form you can't
 
01:58:56.070 --> 01:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
complete that to the satisfaction of the
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
people doing the checklist in the town
 
01:58:58.159 --> 01:58:59.030 align:start position:0%
people doing the checklist in the town
clerk

01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
01:59:01.109 --> 01:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
then we'll still give you a ballot you
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
could it would be a provisional ballot
 
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
you put an envelope seal the envelope
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
attach your uh application to it
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
and uh if we can verify
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
prior to accounting then so be it if we
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
can't then we'll put it aside and
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
depending on the majority
 
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
or the difference in the votes whether
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
these provisional ballots are necessary
 
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
to make a difference in the in the
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
outcome then they will be counted and
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
those that can't be verified have to be
 
01:59:29.910 --> 01:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
put aside and held and not counted
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's essentially the
 
01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:00:06.070 --> 02:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
back up we are back up all right
 
02:00:09.679 --> 02:00:13.990 align:start position:0%
back up we are back up all right
alvin

02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
we don't need no yt
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:21.669 --> 02:00:21.679 align:start position:0%
questions i think i was recognizing
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh so a going back mr mcilroy to the
 
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
person in your community who
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
you say you don't think should be voting
 
02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:38.629 align:start position:0%
you say you don't think should be voting
there

02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
she's a school teacher her children
 
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
attend school in massachusetts
 
02:00:45.669 --> 02:00:45.679 align:start position:0%
and she
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
was working remotely at i guess it would
 
02:00:52.229 --> 02:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
be a second property in campton right
 
02:00:52.239 --> 02:00:53.189 align:start position:0%
be a second property in campton right
okay

02:00:53.189 --> 02:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
did she have her automobile registered
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:00:58.320 --> 02:00:59.510 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
yes

02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
she also licensed in new hampshire
 
02:01:04.229 --> 02:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
then in that case would she
 
02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
be considered a resident under the
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
provisions of this
 
02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
proposed bill here
 
02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
that she would not even be a provisional
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
voter she would be able to vote just
 
02:01:18.239 --> 02:01:22.550 align:start position:0%
voter she would be able to vote just
fine

02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
is that the case
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
one would uh need to get into a great
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
deal of more detail that perhaps would
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
be an invasion of privacy but
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
if one registers their car in new
 
02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire you're going to pay an awful
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
lot less money than if you registered in
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and the checks and
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
balances to make sure that that person
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
was completely honest is somewhat
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
suspect so the answer to the question is
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes the car was registered but indeed
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
was it registered legally and all right
 
02:01:51.669 --> 02:01:51.679 align:start position:0%
but notwithstanding let's stick to the
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions in the bill the question is
 
02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:56.229 align:start position:0%
questions in the bill the question is
notwithstanding

02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
whether or not the registration itself
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
was legal because trust me
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
election law is not getting into motor
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration legality we are not
 
02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:08.149 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration legality we are not
um

02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
no representative derozan please hold so
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
the question was
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
if under your bill
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
under this bill it's not your bill it's
 
02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
two representatives under hb 1543 if
 
02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
someone presents a new ham a valid new
 
02:02:28.229 --> 02:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire motor vehicle registration
 
02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
will will that
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
be proof of domicile slash residence the
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
change you've made in your bill
 
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
allowing them to be given a ballot
 
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you all right
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative tarosian
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:02:47.189 --> 02:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
just as a further clarification so if
 
02:02:47.199 --> 02:02:48.070 align:start position:0%
just as a further clarification so if
this

02:02:48.070 --> 02:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
proposed bill was law would that in any
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
i believe it would it could let me put
 
02:02:59.910 --> 02:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
it that way no i think the answer that
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
the witnesses that the witness just gave
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
before that was that it would not that
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
what the witness just said is if you
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
present a valid motor vehicle
 
02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
registration under this law you would be
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
entitled to use that as proof of
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
domicile and be able to vote we're not
 
02:03:16.149 --> 02:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
getting into the legality or even
 
02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
suggesting that our election law
 
02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:19.430 align:start position:0%
suggesting that our election law
officials

02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
officials
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
are someone to be questioning whether or
 
02:03:23.669 --> 02:03:23.679 align:start position:0%
not a motor vehicle registration is
 
02:03:23.679 --> 02:03:27.189 align:start position:0%
not a motor vehicle registration is
valid

02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative hamer
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um what
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
about a new voter who doesn't have a
 
02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:35.750 align:start position:0%
about a new voter who doesn't have a
vehicle

02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
maybe they're disabled or they're
 
02:03:37.679 --> 02:03:41.510 align:start position:0%
maybe they're disabled or they're
elderly

02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have a vehicle to
 
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
register so part of this
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and law
 
02:03:49.189 --> 02:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:03:49.199 --> 02:03:51.750 align:start position:0%
would be
nil

02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
thank you it would not apply to that
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
person if you are a driver or if you are
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
owner of an automobile but these are
 
02:03:59.589 --> 02:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
really secondary issues
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
but our bill suggests that no tells you
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
that you need to follow the existing
 
02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
rsas in the motor vehicle rsa section
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh and we think that that tightens
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
things up a little bit but yes you're
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
right if they didn't drive or they
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
didn't own a car then that would not
 
02:04:16.229 --> 02:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from
 
02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none thanks for coming and
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
thanks for going through the bill a bit
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this is alvin
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
c and we are going to be doing three
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman members of
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name's alvin c and i'm
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
from loudoun and i'm here to speak in
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
i would like to point out and and this
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
is just a real quick thing on page 2
 
02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.990 align:start position:0%
is just a real quick thing on page 2
line

02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
21 actions
 
02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that reveal your intent
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
to make new hampshire
 
02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
you play
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
i think that should be your
 
02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
include but are not limited to
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
and it gives several things but the one
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
on line 24 which says registering to
 
02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
on line 24 which says registering to
vote

02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
i think should be stricken because it's
 
02:05:23.669 --> 02:05:23.679 align:start position:0%
a circular argument if you're filling
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
out this form to register to vote
 
02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:28.149 align:start position:0%
out this form to register to vote
then

02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
then by by
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
usually it's just telemarketers but
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
anyhow registering to vote
 
02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
by definition then becomes one of the
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
items that shows that you
 
02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
make new hampshire your domicile so
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
i think that should be sticking out
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
that's all i really had on this
 
02:06:02.470 --> 02:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for mr c
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anything
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:28.790 align:start position:0%
 
hi

02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
hi
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
dan healy town clerk of derry
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
representing our new hampshire city and
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
town clerks association
 
02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this bill
 
02:06:38.079 --> 02:06:38.870 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this bill
um

02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
going through the bill i'd like to point
 
02:06:42.550 --> 02:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
out a few things
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
on page 4
 
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
it says the town clerk shall follow up
 
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
with the dmv to ensure applicant has
 
02:06:54.550 --> 02:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
acquired a new hampshire driver's
 
02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:55.510 align:start position:0%
acquired a new hampshire driver's
license

02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:06:58.870 --> 02:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
after 60 days
 
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how town clerks would do
 
02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't provide any type of
 
02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:04.790 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't provide any type of
procedure

02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure the dmv is just going to
 
02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
give us give out information like that
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say how we are to get that
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
information how the dmv is supplied to
 
02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:14.629 align:start position:0%
information how the dmv is supplied to
us

02:07:14.629 --> 02:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
if if town clerks are even
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
able to get that information
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:33.679 --> 02:07:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
suggests does the applicant own any
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles subject to new hampshire
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration requirements
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
ensure follow up with applicant to
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
verify new hampshire registration has
 
02:07:49.109 --> 02:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
been completed
 
02:07:51.669 --> 02:07:51.679 align:start position:0%
not all town and city clerks register
 
02:07:51.679 --> 02:07:53.270 align:start position:0%
not all town and city clerks register
vehicles

02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
so that's going to be a problem for the
 
02:07:56.790 --> 02:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
clerks that don't
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
in derry our tax collector actually
 
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
handles the vehicles i don't have access
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
to any of the motor vehicle information
 
02:08:05.189 --> 02:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
so it's telling the town clerk
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
to follow up to to see if they
 
02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
registered a vehicle but i don't have
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
lines 21 through 20
 
02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:33.669 align:start position:0%
lines 21 through 20
27

02:08:33.669 --> 02:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
the the main part of this is if the town
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
clerk or city declare determined such
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
registration to be complete and accurate
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
he or she shall sign the registration
 
02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:45.109 align:start position:0%
he or she shall sign the registration
form

02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
form
 
02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
the town clerk doesn't sign the voter
 
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
registration form that would be the
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist they're the
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
ones responsible for approving or
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
denying a voter registration
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
so it's telling the town clerk now that
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that would approve or
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
or deny the registration on election day
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
and that's not really the town clerk's
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
job it's more of a supervisor function
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
and then our last concern
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
is on the same page page 8
 
02:09:18.310 --> 02:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
lines 35-37
 
02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's basically saying that if there's a
 
02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
close race those provisional ballots
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
account within 24 hours
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know what more information we're
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to find out in the 24 hours that
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have known the night before
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of a moot point to then
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
count them 24 hours later
 
02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't really even have time to
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
verify any of the the other information
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
if we even could
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
so those are our association's concerns
 
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
with with this bill and i'd be open to
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%

uh i'd just like to uh voice my uh
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
approval of this bill and my support for
 
02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:35.750 align:start position:0%
approval of this bill and my support for
the

02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
hb 1543.
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
most emphatically the provisional ballot
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of and i'm quite surprised
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire hasn't established
 
02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
this already particularly with the fact
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
that there's a same-day voting process
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
here in the state
 
02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:52.550 align:start position:0%
here in the state
and

02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:55.109 --> 02:10:55.119 align:start position:0%
as already has been mentioned
 
02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
that process was is quite uh
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
hectic on the day of voting
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
could most likely arise uh questions
 
02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:04.790 align:start position:0%
could most likely arise uh questions
after

02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
after
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
after the fact
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
and my understanding in new hampshire
 
02:11:11.109 --> 02:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm going to cite it off of a
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3 which i pulled off of
 
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
the state web page
 
02:11:18.149 --> 02:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong i i'm assuming
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
that that for those these provisions are
 
02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
still in effect in law
 
02:11:22.239 --> 02:11:23.109 align:start position:0%
still in effect in law
but

02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
it states in that uh in that bill
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
and these these are guidance
 
02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
identified as registering to vote in new
 
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire guidelines
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
in that provision it states regarding
 
02:11:39.109 --> 02:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
regarding voting same day same day
 
02:11:39.119 --> 02:11:39.990 align:start position:0%
regarding voting same day same day
voting

02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
registration or shortly there before
 
02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
it says if you do not have documents to
 
02:11:46.950 --> 02:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
establish your qualifications please
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
bring them
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
if if you have documents to establish
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
your qualifications please bring them
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
when you register if you do not have
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
documents or forget to bring them it has
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
three bullets identifying the next steps
 
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
it states in bold capital letters you
 
02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
will be able to register to vote
 
02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
second bullet states you will be able to
 
02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
vote and the third bullet states you
 
02:12:11.109 --> 02:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
will use a regular election day ballot
 
02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
that is counted on election day
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
if they're same day voting and those are
 
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
the established criteria
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
i cannot understand how a provisional
 
02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
ballot cannot be at hand
 
02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:25.589 align:start position:0%
ballot cannot be at hand
because

02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
after the fact which would be after
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
there may be found
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
with the registrant's
 
02:12:35.199 --> 02:12:35.990 align:start position:0%
with the registrant's
uh

02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
facts and if if it's found that that
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
person was in
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
voted invalid
 
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
there's no way
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
to go back and correct the ballot that's
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
already been cast
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
a provisional ballot will not
 
02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
prohibit someone from casting the ballot
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
but it will put in a proper procedure
 
02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
that will allow for security
 
02:13:00.069 --> 02:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
and a fair voting process
 
02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
so for that the provisional ballot part
 
02:13:05.830 --> 02:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill i think is is essential i
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
cannot understand how a fair and secure
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
election could be conducted
 
02:13:11.669 --> 02:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
with those
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
rules that are already in place on
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
allowing same-day
 
02:13:17.350 --> 02:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
registration or shortly before election
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
day registration with these provisions
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
without a provisional ballot
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
and with that that's uh conclusion my my
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
thoughts thank you thank you does
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any
 
02:13:32.229 --> 02:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:45.270 --> 02:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
may i pass out my
 
02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:46.470 align:start position:0%
may i pass out my
testimony

02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:13:46.480 --> 02:14:01.270 align:start position:0%
testimony
thanks

02:14:01.270 --> 02:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is liz tentarelli
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
i live in newbury new hampshire and i
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
will first speak
 
02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
personally representing only myself to
 
02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
address the provisional ballot part of
 
02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:15.350 align:start position:0%
address the provisional ballot part of
this

02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
people don't like provisional ballots
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
i wonder
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
what would happen to our first in the
 
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
nation primary status
 
02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
if we were to use provisional ballots
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
candidates the press and the voters want
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
instant gratification we want those
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
results right away
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
i realize how important first in the
 
02:14:40.229 --> 02:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
nation presidential primary status is to
 
02:14:41.589 --> 02:14:41.599 align:start position:0%
many people
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
so i'd like you to think about that
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
related to provisional ballots
 
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
next i would like to speak representing
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
the league of women voters and i would
 
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
like to correct a statement from the
 
02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:56.629 align:start position:0%
like to correct a statement from the
previous

02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
previous
 
02:15:00.310 --> 02:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
person testifying that sb3 is in effect
 
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
02:15:03.589 --> 02:15:03.599 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
is not in effect the new hampshire
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
supreme court ruled it unconstitutional
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
because it quote placed an undue burden
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
on the right to vote
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the first part of
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
this bill the registration process
 
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
tries to do exactly the same thing
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
so my written testimony gives a number
 
02:15:28.159 --> 02:15:29.189 align:start position:0%
so my written testimony gives a number
of

02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
reasons and specifics and i thank alvin
 
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
c for pointing out the circular logic on
 
02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
page two
 
02:15:40.629 --> 02:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
that's in my testimony as well
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
and in fact a lot of this is circular
 
02:15:48.229 --> 02:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
logic and confusing to potential voters
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
if people try to vote fraudulently they
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
should be prosecuted
 
02:15:57.510 --> 02:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
but for the huge majority of people who
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
want to register
 
02:16:02.550 --> 02:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
want to participate in our government
 
02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
this is an undue complication it is not
 
02:16:06.159 --> 02:16:08.390 align:start position:0%
this is an undue complication it is not
necessary

02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
and i do point out that the state paid
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
over four million dollars and hundreds
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
of hours of staff time to fight sb3
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
and while this is not worded the same as
 
02:16:24.629 --> 02:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
sb3 the confusing status
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
the attempt to suppress voting uh is is
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
the same intent
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we want to go through
 
02:16:33.669 --> 02:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
that again
 
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
so i thank you for this opportunity to
 
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
speak both as an individual and
 
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
representing league of women voters and
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
if there are any questions i'd be glad
 
02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
to address them any questions from
 
02:16:46.309 --> 02:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you also
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on this bill is
 
02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair
 
02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:06.389 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair
i'm

02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
mostly here to introduce the next bill
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
but i figured i need to chime in on this
 
02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
one in opposition there's a couple of uh
 
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
couple of points in particular one as
 
02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
we're going on about the
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
driver's license and the driver
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
registration those are of course not
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
requirements to vote but also
 
02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:25.669 align:start position:0%
requirements to vote but also
moreover

02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
moreover
 
02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
having a the wrong address on your
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
driver's license or having a incorrect
 
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle registration is it's not a
 
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
felony so it doesn't
 
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
disqualify you from voting it doesn't
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
take away any of your other civil rights
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
you know it's just a minor motor vehicle
 
02:17:39.599 --> 02:17:40.870 align:start position:0%
you know it's just a minor motor vehicle
uh

02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
violation so uh
 
02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:44.549 align:start position:0%
violation so uh
normally

02:17:44.549 --> 02:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
normally
 
02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
normally for violations of that uh
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
magnitude in other areas nobody would
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
say that you should lose your right to
 
02:17:52.469 --> 02:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
vote over those um also especially with
 
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses
 
02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
we have a reciprocal agreement with
 
02:17:59.110 --> 02:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
every other state in the union and uh
 
02:18:02.709 --> 02:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
also all the canadian provinces and
 
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm by no means an expert on either but
 
02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:06.150 align:start position:0%
i'm by no means an expert on either but
basically

02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of identification the
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
purpose of proving your authorized to
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
drive any state's driver's license is as
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
good as any other
 
02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
true even when you're registering to
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
vote you do need another document to
 
02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
prove your uh your
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
your citizenship and your address but
 
02:18:25.509 --> 02:18:25.519 align:start position:0%
that's a sufficient proof of who you are
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
02:18:27.439 --> 02:18:28.469 align:start position:0%
and there are
um

02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
there are other uh there are like other
 
02:18:30.479 --> 02:18:31.190 align:start position:0%
there are other uh there are like other
uh

02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
other things there are other things you
 
02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
can show in addition to driver's license
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
prove your identity like your uh armed
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
forces id or your which uh also are not
 
02:18:39.359 --> 02:18:40.870 align:start position:0%
forces id or your which uh also are not
necessarily

02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
tied just to this address where you are
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
currently and also
 
02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
the provisional ballots um it's very
 
02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:48.070 align:start position:0%
the provisional ballots um it's very
very

02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
complicated or like we're having enough
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
trouble uh you know it's we should keep
 
02:18:54.389 --> 02:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
our elections as simple as possible and
 
02:18:54.399 --> 02:18:55.830 align:start position:0%
our elections as simple as possible and
um

02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
that also if we have a close election um
 
02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
that'll create a lot of doubt about the
 
02:19:03.509 --> 02:19:03.519 align:start position:0%
validity of the uh results we certainly
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
almost had uh
 
02:19:06.870 --> 02:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
we nearly had a very tragic situation
 
02:19:08.790 --> 02:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
nationwide with the 2020 presidential
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
election i know there's a wide
 
02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
range of opinions about that but
 
02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure everybody agrees that uh
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
that at least the losing candidate had
 
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
pretty severe doubts about the validity
 
02:19:21.509 --> 02:19:21.519 align:start position:0%
of the election and that uh kind of
 
02:19:23.429 --> 02:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
complicated the peaceful transfer of
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
power although it did happen and that
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
could happen on a statewide level
 
02:19:26.319 --> 02:19:27.270 align:start position:0%
could happen on a statewide level
senator

02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
senator
 
02:19:29.830 --> 02:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to insist at this point that
 
02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
you speak
 
02:19:33.030 --> 02:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
to the bill okay i was speaking about
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
just showing his example why provisional
 
02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
ballots are over complication and a bad
 
02:19:38.830 --> 02:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
idea um so that's um
 
02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:40.950 align:start position:0%
idea um so that's um
[Music]

02:19:40.950 --> 02:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
such basically those two issues and also
 
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
just historically going back in the
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
history uh back in you know
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
the uh 19th 18th century you didn't need
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
to own a horse or register your horse
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
and even today you know you don't need
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
to own a car to drive there are at least
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
you don't even need to be registered
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
don't even have a driver's license i
 
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
know there are at least three members of
 
02:20:02.469 --> 02:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
this legislature who do not have
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses because they cannot
 
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
physically cannot drive and you know
 
02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:08.070 align:start position:0%
physically cannot drive and you know
there's

02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
other reasons why people
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know so you don't need to have a
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
driver's license to vote although it's
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
certainly a good thing to happen
 
02:20:16.630 --> 02:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
and also it's a good thing to people
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
again if you can wrap it up okay that's
 
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
about what i had
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
had to say that it's uh
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
you know that this is just a necessary
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
complication and um so i just thought
 
02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'd bring up try to bring up those
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
points before i went and introduced my
 
02:20:30.389 --> 02:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
bill which those issues may come up in
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
that one too so thank you thank you
 
02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill as
 
02:20:47.349 --> 02:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:48.870 --> 02:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
hi thank you madam chair i'm the
 
02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
committee for taking my testimony my
 
02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
name is louise spencer i'm from concord
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm co-founder of the kent street
 
02:20:58.150 --> 02:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
coalition which is an all volunteer
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
grassroots advocacy organization
 
02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
but i speak today here on my own behalf
 
02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:07.030 align:start position:0%
but i speak today here on my own behalf
i

02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
find this bill to be
 
02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:10.230 align:start position:0%
find this bill to be
beyond

02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:11.510 align:start position:0%
beyond
disturbing

02:21:11.510 --> 02:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
disturbing
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
i have to say
 
02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
the idea that we would create
 
02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
two classes of voters some of which are
 
02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:22.230 align:start position:0%
two classes of voters some of which are
essentially

02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
being deemed as second-class
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
citizens who
 
02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:27.990 align:start position:0%
citizens who
are

02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
having to use a different ballot who are
 
02:21:33.750 --> 02:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
having to vote in a different booth
 
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
or could potentially
 
02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
lead people to
 
02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
interpret them as being somehow less
 
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
worthy of voting or cast suspicion on
 
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
their right to vote
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
is beyond offensive in a democracy
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
it is not the way we've done things here
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it certainly is not the
 
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
way i hope that we do things
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:04.070 align:start position:0%
in the future
also

02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
being from away is not a
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
disqualification for voting in new
 
02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:10.150 align:start position:0%
disqualification for voting in new
hampshire

02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
we are encouraging people to move to
 
02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
this state
 
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
we need people to move to this state
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
especially young people
 
02:22:21.910 --> 02:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
and this idea that
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
somebody can be questioned in whether
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
they belong to a particular town or they
 
02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't belong
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
is problematic particularly in the
 
02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
instance cited
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
where in fact the person appeared to
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
have met the requirements for voting
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
it was reviewed by the ag and yet her
 
02:22:46.950 --> 02:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
right to vote was still being questioned
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
i find that
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
and as someone who was involved with the
 
02:22:55.120 --> 02:22:56.150 align:start position:0%
and as someone who was involved with the
um

02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
sb3 lawsuit which dragged on for a long
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
three years at great expense
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
of time and effort
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
i certainly would hope that we would not
 
02:23:08.710 --> 02:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
go down a bill which clearly burdens the
 
02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
right to vote in many of the same ways
 
02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:13.270 align:start position:0%
right to vote in many of the same ways
that

02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
the court found that sb3
 
02:23:18.070 --> 02:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
burden the right to the fundamental
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
right to vote
 
02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
and i do want to also end with
 
02:23:25.349 --> 02:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
underscoring that point the right to
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
vote is a right it is not a privilege
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
it is a right
 
02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
and any law
 
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
being looked at
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
to impact that
 
02:23:39.389 --> 02:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
that right that fundamental
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional right
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
both under u.s and state constitution
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be tread people need to tread
 
02:23:50.950 --> 02:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
very very carefully
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
so as not to
 
02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:54.950 align:start position:0%
so as not to
upend

02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
upend
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
that essential right of democracy so
 
02:24:00.070 --> 02:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
with that i will end my testimony thank
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
you does anybody have any questions for
 
02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none thank you thank you so

hello again
 
02:24:33.429 --> 02:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is katie gargano
 
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm representing the secretary of
 
02:24:37.830 --> 02:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
state's office i'm speaking on behalf of
 
02:24:40.389 --> 02:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
house bill 1543 for informational
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
purposes only and i'd like to raise a
 
02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
few concerns that we found within the
 
02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:45.990 align:start position:0%
few concerns that we found within the
bill

02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
the bill brings many changes to our
 
02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
existing voter registration form
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
on page 1 line 11 states that the form
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
shall be no larger than eight and a half
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
by 11 inches
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
but the next almost five pages of the
 
02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
bill are items that must appear on the
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
form so
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
that may need some work
 
02:25:08.309 --> 02:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
the information that's requested
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
has many duplicates there's as an
 
02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
example there
 
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
are asking for the voter's name and
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
address multiple times throughout the
 
02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:17.910 align:start position:0%
address multiple times throughout the
bill

02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
and it would uh this would increase wait
 
02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
times at the polls and longer lines that
 
02:25:24.309 --> 02:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
the supervisors of the checklist table
 
02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
if voters had to fill out a form as it's
 
02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:29.030 align:start position:0%
if voters had to fill out a form as it's
presented

02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
presented
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
i won't be speaking about the
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
provisional balance section because
 
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
there's already been multiple bills out
 
02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
there that you've heard
 
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
that is the last speaker that i had
 
02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.240 align:start position:0%

02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:25:58.389 --> 02:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
with an amendment that's been presented
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%

minute ago that i'm representative
 
02:26:43.510 --> 02:26:43.520 align:start position:0%

testimony on this bill i uh my
 
02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:00.469 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill i uh my
scheduler

02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
scheduler
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
somehow had the idea that this hearing
 
02:27:04.870 --> 02:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
was on march 10th and it was february
 
02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
10th and i i've i've
 
02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:08.389 align:start position:0%
10th and i i've i've
i've

02:27:08.389 --> 02:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
i've
 
02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
i've discussed that extensively with
 
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
that member of my staff and uh he's very
 
02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
sorry for the mistake he made but but
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
i'm here and i do from what i wrote last
 
02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
year about fb
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
hb 538 and i hope it's okay to
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledge at least that uh both the
 
02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
well actually all through the 2020
 
02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
legislative session the 2020 legislative
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
session and this one all took place
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
under unique circumstances so we kind of
 
02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
did things
 
02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
differently than we did
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
we would have otherwise and you know
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing the best we can and um
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
and the committee this hb 1203 was a
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
basically an identical bill aside from
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
the dates which went before this
 
02:27:47.510 --> 02:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee and um
 
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
you did decide to find it inexpedient to
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
legislate and normally that would have
 
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
been the end of the story except it
 
02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
never made it to the floor of the house
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
it wasn't even tabled so you know the
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
rules allow me to bring it back so here
 
02:28:02.309 --> 02:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
i am again and um if you
 
02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan i just missed it
 
02:28:05.349 --> 02:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
can you give me the number from the
 
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
first year again oh this is uh virtually
 
02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
identical to uh hb i'm sorry i may have
 
02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
hp 538 is i may have said hb 1203 which
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
is the bill i'm talking about right okay
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
and um so we we
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
we had a hearing on it last year and um
 
02:28:21.670 --> 02:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know it did come out of the
 
02:28:24.309 --> 02:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
committee itl 11 to 9 which i'm i'm
 
02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
going to guess that that's the same as
 
02:28:27.750 --> 02:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
the number of members of that time from
 
02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
each party but i don't remember don't
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
know who exactly who voted how but
 
02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.030 align:start position:0%
know who exactly who voted how but
um

02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
that was then this was now and then
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
hp 538 in terms of combination two bills
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
which i sponsored in 2019 which actually
 
02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh passed the house and senate before
 
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
being vetoed by the uh by the governor
 
02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
and even under the
 
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
free pandemic rules the way we did
 
02:28:55.670 --> 02:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
things veto bills can be reintroduced
 
02:28:57.590 --> 02:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
next year so i decided to introduce
 
02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
those two bills and the uh
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
that time they were actually tabled so
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
like the governor never got it they
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
never even made it to to the senate but
 
02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:07.429 align:start position:0%
never even made it to to the senate but
um

02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:08.950 --> 02:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
and this so
 
02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's um there's it it's a lot more
 
02:29:13.670 --> 02:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
complicated than looks i'm basically
 
02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
just overturning three bills um
 
02:29:19.270 --> 02:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
sb3 which was in 2017 you heard a lot
 
02:29:21.750 --> 02:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
about there's an early one sp 318 which
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
covered some of the same ground as sp3
 
02:29:25.309 --> 02:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
and then hp
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
1264. and um
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
so the
 
02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
part about sp3 makes up the first 15
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
sections of the 17 section bill and i'm
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
sure you've all read it and memorized it
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
or probably not but um
 
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
so the first thing it does is just as i
 
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
said the first thing the sb3 uh
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
forms which actually are the laws not
 
02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
currently being enforced because it was
 
02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh challenged in federal court but just
 
02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
just greatly complicated and made the uh
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
made the forms a lot more duplicative
 
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
put a lot of pretty scary language so
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's intimidating the voters and it was
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
also written at a phd level of reading
 
02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
of a reading comprehension and um i we
 
02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
actually my town actually does have a
 
02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
few phds living there but i think even
 
02:30:11.590 --> 02:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
they found them i mean they filled out
 
02:30:13.270 --> 02:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
the forms they plowed through it i've
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
watched uh
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
i watched unh students some of whom were
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
undergraduates and graduates alike and
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
they all managed to fill out the forms
 
02:30:23.750 --> 02:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
but it was just unnecessarily cumbersome
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's like they were trying to take out a
 
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
mortgage or something so that's
 
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
and there's also
 
02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
two things about residency so they added
 
02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:34.230 align:start position:0%
two things about residency so they added
uh

02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:30:36.070 --> 02:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
they added the phrase for the indefinite
 
02:30:37.750 --> 02:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
future uh
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
there they actually took it out of the
 
02:30:40.790 --> 02:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
law and i'm trying to put it back in
 
02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
either way it's kind of a
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
meaningless phrase because
 
02:30:46.790 --> 02:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
everybody's future is indefinite but it
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
did seem at least be interpreted by
 
02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
someone's attempt to prevent uh students
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
and other people who are
 
02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
transient to move around a lot from
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
voting in new hampshire and that's uh
 
02:30:58.389 --> 02:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
for sure that's unconstitutional there's
 
02:30:58.399 --> 02:30:59.429 align:start position:0%
for sure that's unconstitutional there's
uh

02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:30:59.439 --> 02:31:00.389 align:start position:0%
uh
several

02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
several
 
02:31:02.309 --> 02:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
federal court cases including the famous
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
neuberger course which was a dartmouth
 
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
student who uh
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
basically his parents were dead and he
 
02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
lived in hawaii so he had no residence
 
02:31:11.830 --> 02:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
other than than hanover but
 
02:31:13.270 --> 02:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
he wasn't sure where you live in hanover
 
02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's also like the
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
sims decision in texas which had to do
 
02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
with a uh historically black college
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
that was located in uh you know as a
 
02:31:22.950 --> 02:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
suburb of houston and there's a conflict
 
02:31:24.870 --> 02:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know with the county
 
02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
elections commission specifically
 
02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:27.670 align:start position:0%
elections commission specifically
guaranteed

02:31:27.670 --> 02:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
guaranteed
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
college students the right to vote on
 
02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
their at their college addresses because
 
02:31:32.230 --> 02:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
i know there's a lot of talk about
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
residents permanent residents blah blah
 
02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
blah but um
 
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
college students like are not um
 
02:31:40.150 --> 02:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
are residents of the place where they're
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
living most of the year
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
and they are entitled to claim that as
 
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
their domicile and there's really no
 
02:31:49.429 --> 02:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
good way in law to distinguish them from
 
02:31:51.510 --> 02:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
other people who move there for other
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
reasons you know they all
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
pay rent they pay taxes they hold jobs
 
02:31:56.950 --> 02:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
they do everything else everybody else
 
02:31:59.750 --> 02:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
does in new hampshire and
 
02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
any attempt to
 
02:32:02.950 --> 02:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise them aside from being a
 
02:32:05.030 --> 02:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
bad idea and unconstitutional it's going
 
02:32:06.710 --> 02:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
to take in a lot of other people who
 
02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
you're not trying to get you know who
 
02:32:11.110 --> 02:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
aren't students you're not trying to uh
 
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's just essentially uh essentially
 
02:32:18.230 --> 02:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
unfair and unwise for many reasons also
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
if you actually
 
02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
did manage to come up with some formula
 
02:32:24.469 --> 02:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
that somehow would exclude students for
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire but
 
02:32:28.150 --> 02:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
allow everybody else who's moved there
 
02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
relatively recently a long time ago
 
02:32:31.750 --> 02:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to probably create a class
 
02:32:32.950 --> 02:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
of people who
 
02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
can't vote anywhere and i don't think
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
anybody wants that
 
02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
has been represented
 
02:32:40.309 --> 02:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
well they can just vote absentee back
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
home but absentee voting is you know
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
they often attach the adverb simply to
 
02:32:47.030 --> 02:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
it and synthetic voting is not simple
 
02:32:48.550 --> 02:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's getting more complicated there's no
 
02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:51.429 align:start position:0%
it's getting more complicated there's no
guarantee

02:32:51.429 --> 02:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
yeah there's no guarantee that uh you
 
02:32:54.790 --> 02:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
know someone who's a student at one of
 
02:32:56.630 --> 02:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
our colleges universities could simply
 
02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
vote absentee back home they may not
 
02:32:59.750 --> 02:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements there but they
 
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
certainly are residents at the place
 
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
where they're living when they're going
 
02:33:05.349 --> 02:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
to college and that also is by the way
 
02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
where the census counts them so the uh
 
02:33:11.750 --> 02:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'm we're still working under the uh
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
2010 census but the 16 000 or so uh
 
02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
inhabitants of my district who are
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
enumerated in
 
02:33:23.429 --> 02:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
in 2010 included uh included all the
 
02:33:25.349 --> 02:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
students who were living on campus or on
 
02:33:27.349 --> 02:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
off-campus student-oriented residences
 
02:33:27.359 --> 02:33:28.150 align:start position:0%
off-campus student-oriented residences
and

02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
the same was also true with the 2020
 
02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
census as uh which many of you have been
 
02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
on the registration committee so that's
 
02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
basically basically my bill just changes
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
a couple of uh
 
02:33:41.190 --> 02:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
unwise changes to the law back it's a
 
02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
lot simpler than it looked as many pages
 
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
long and um
 
02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
i apologize for not having written
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
testimony just on this bill i had a
 
02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:48.469 align:start position:0%
testimony just on this bill i had a
little

02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
little
 
02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of a
 
02:33:52.070 --> 02:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
as i said my scheduler screwed it up and
 
02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:52.870 align:start position:0%
as i said my scheduler screwed it up and
then

02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
we also then
 
02:33:56.950 --> 02:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
i then also like the technology down in
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
the new uh
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
work area down where the smoking areas
 
02:34:01.750 --> 02:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's they still haven't got all the bugs
 
02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
worked out of it so even though i knew
 
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
in principle how to
 
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
copy and paste and
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
make a new set of testimony for this
 
02:34:11.190 --> 02:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
bill uh just take what i did in march
 
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
2021 and adapt it to now but i was just
 
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
not able to do it in time so

with my good friend representative
horrigan

02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
horrigan
 
02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
for some years now but there is
 
02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
something in this bill that i can agree
 
02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
on with him and i'll get to that in a
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
minute um
 
02:35:06.950 --> 02:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
there's a history with this bill related
 
02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
to the definition of domicile and
 
02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:13.510 align:start position:0%
to the definition of domicile and
residency

02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
residency
 
02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:14.389 align:start position:0%
residency
and

02:35:14.389 --> 02:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
at the
 
02:35:17.910 --> 02:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
beginning of the century you know in the
 
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
2000s there were some statutory changes
 
02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
and some court rulings
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
created a fuzzy definition of just what
 
02:35:28.870 --> 02:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
domicile in new hampshire meant
 
02:35:31.590 --> 02:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
especially for the purposes of voting
 
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
and that created a situation where we
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
were unique among the 50 states
 
02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:37.750 align:start position:0%
were unique among the 50 states
um

02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:38.710 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
it was that the laws were such that
 
02:35:43.349 --> 02:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
a person that would otherwise be
 
02:35:45.270 --> 02:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
considered transient
 
02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
not a not a resident of the state but
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
somebody just passing through
 
02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
for a period of time could register and
 
02:35:52.150 --> 02:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
vote here
 
02:35:54.309 --> 02:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
and so more recently the laws have
 
02:35:56.950 --> 02:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
changed and we had an advisory
 
02:35:59.590 --> 02:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
opinion from the supreme court
 
02:36:02.469 --> 02:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
that said that domicile and residency
 
02:36:04.790 --> 02:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
are now effectively the same thing and
 
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
02:36:07.670 --> 02:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
and that puts us in alignment with the
 
02:36:10.550 --> 02:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
other 49 states in that regard
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with college
 
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
students it just simply has to do with
 
02:36:18.950 --> 02:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
a single standard on what residency and
 
02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
domicile means
 
02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:36:25.270 --> 02:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
as long as a college student considers
 
02:36:27.429 --> 02:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire their residents and they
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
agree to abide by the same laws as any
 
02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
other state
 
02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
then they're fully entitled to vote here
 
02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
just like any other resident
 
02:36:37.110 --> 02:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
if they're not willing to
 
02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
take those steps and make that
 
02:36:40.469 --> 02:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
commitment then they should be voting
 
02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
from the place that they came from as an
 
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
absentee voter and it's that basic
 
02:36:48.950 --> 02:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
other states in their statutes you know
 
02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
apply uh
 
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
some exemptions for students and i won't
 
02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
go into all of those but
 
02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:57.510 align:start position:0%
go into all of those but
um

02:36:57.510 --> 02:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:59.190 --> 02:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know our neighboring states treat
 
02:37:01.429 --> 02:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
college students differently outside of
 
02:37:03.750 --> 02:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
the single stat standard that you have
 
02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
to be a resident
 
02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:07.429 align:start position:0%
to be a resident
um

02:37:07.429 --> 02:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:09.750 --> 02:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
so you know i i believe that the
 
02:37:12.070 --> 02:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
statutes in terms of the definition of
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
residency and domicile are where they
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and we should leave it alone the
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
one area in the bill that does need some
 
02:37:25.030 --> 02:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
work is that as has been mentioned
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
the state lost the lawsuit uh on the
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
enactment of senate bill 3.
 
02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
that language that we cannot enforce or
 
02:37:35.349 --> 02:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
administer is
 
02:37:37.670 --> 02:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh in some significant portions of our
 
02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:38.950 align:start position:0%
uh in some significant portions of our
statute

02:37:38.950 --> 02:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's confusing and you heard
 
02:37:42.790 --> 02:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
testimony on another bill from a couple
 
02:37:44.389 --> 02:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
of gentlemen that were
 
02:37:47.429 --> 02:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
talking about that language as if it was
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
02:37:50.389 --> 02:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
it isn't a statute but it's not
 
02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
enforceable so to make our statutes
 
02:37:55.110 --> 02:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
clear we probably should take a look at
 
02:37:55.120 --> 02:37:55.990 align:start position:0%
clear we probably should take a look at
uh

02:37:55.990 --> 02:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:37:57.990 --> 02:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
at cleaning that up so
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
the language reads uh
 
02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:01.830 align:start position:0%
the language reads uh
um

02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:06.469 --> 02:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:08.389 --> 02:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
along those lines i you know i've i've
 
02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
heard the the the uh
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of money thrown out there
 
02:38:13.990 --> 02:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
that the state spent four million
 
02:38:15.750 --> 02:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
dollars on defending
 
02:38:17.190 --> 02:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
that lawsuit
 
02:38:19.270 --> 02:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
which when a suit is made has to be
 
02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:20.630 align:start position:0%
which when a suit is made has to be
defended

02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
defended
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
of that four million dollars
 
02:38:25.349 --> 02:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
around a million dollars was spent by
 
02:38:26.469 --> 02:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:38:28.309 --> 02:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
with its expert witnesses and the
 
02:38:30.870 --> 02:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys that were used on the case
 
02:38:33.190 --> 02:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
over three million of that was having to
 
02:38:35.670 --> 02:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
pay the plaintiffs attorney fees and so
 
02:38:37.830 --> 02:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's how much the other side spent uh
 
02:38:39.510 --> 02:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
arguing that case
 
02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
and it's standard that when the state
 
02:38:44.950 --> 02:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
loses they pay those fees
 
02:38:47.349 --> 02:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
i will also add that when senate bill 3
 
02:38:47.359 --> 02:38:48.389 align:start position:0%
i will also add that when senate bill 3
was

02:38:48.389 --> 02:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:38:52.469 --> 02:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.630 --> 02:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
using those statutes and that election
 
02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
ran very very smoothly and it was after
 
02:38:56.880 --> 02:38:57.670 align:start position:0%
ran very very smoothly and it was after
that

02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
that the court uh made their ruling that
 
02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
it was uh unconstitutional based on
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
whatever reasoning it was that uh
 
02:39:07.270 --> 02:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
that they felt was appropriate so with
 
02:39:08.469 --> 02:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
that i'd be happy to answer any
 
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
questions questions from committee
 
02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:11.750 align:start position:0%
questions questions from committee
members

02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
members

cacr17

03:38:30.710 --> 03:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
cacr17
 
03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
this is relating to ballot measures and
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
it provides that upon petition by voters
 
03:38:46.870 --> 03:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes madam chairman i move that cacr
 
03:38:52.630 --> 03:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
17 be inexpedient to legislate
 
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:59.189 --> 03:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh very briefly madam chairman as i said
 
03:39:01.269 --> 03:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
during the hearing new hampshire elects
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
its state government every two years
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
we're one of the very few states that
 
03:39:05.670 --> 03:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
change out every facet of state
 
03:39:07.189 --> 03:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
government every two years
 
03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
by such
 
03:39:09.750 --> 03:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
and given that we have such small state
 
03:39:12.070 --> 03:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative districts we are already
 
03:39:14.070 --> 03:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
incredibly responsive to the people and
 
03:39:16.389 --> 03:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
that this i view this as unnecessary
 
03:39:19.830 --> 03:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
given our current form of government
 
03:39:21.590 --> 03:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on this
 
03:39:24.150 --> 03:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron um i also will
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
support the motion i
 
03:39:27.349 --> 03:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know here in new hampshire every
 
03:39:28.870 --> 03:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
bill gets a hearing and a vote and i
 
03:39:30.150 --> 03:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
think we had a good experience this
 
03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
morning that shows it's not that hard to
 
03:39:34.150 --> 03:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
get a bill before the committee to to be
 
03:39:34.160 --> 03:39:35.590 align:start position:0%
get a bill before the committee to to be
considered

03:39:35.590 --> 03:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
considered
 
03:39:37.590 --> 03:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
i think our legislative body is very
 
03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
responsive to our constituents and if
 
03:39:41.110 --> 03:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
they want a bill put before us we we do
 
03:39:44.469 --> 03:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
it for them and so i will also
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
vote to find this in expedient to
 
03:39:46.080 --> 03:39:47.590 align:start position:0%
vote to find this in expedient to
legislate

03:39:47.590 --> 03:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
03:39:49.269 --> 03:39:49.279 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
i want to say that this is an issue that
 
03:39:53.110 --> 03:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
is not new
 
03:39:55.349 --> 03:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
for legislation to be brought before the
 
03:39:58.229 --> 03:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
legislature um whether there is a direct
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
petition or relating to a referendum
 
03:40:04.229 --> 03:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
power of citizens um this is sort of a
 
03:40:06.790 --> 03:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
session reoccurrence not to diminish its
 
03:40:06.800 --> 03:40:07.990 align:start position:0%
session reoccurrence not to diminish its
importance

03:40:07.990 --> 03:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
importance
 
03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
um and i will just note
 
03:40:10.720 --> 03:40:11.910 align:start position:0%
um and i will just note
that

03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:14.550 --> 03:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
in my review of notes i actually ended
 
03:40:15.870 --> 03:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
up pulling up
 
03:40:15.880 --> 03:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
up pulling up
cacr17

03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
cacr17
 
03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:18.389 align:start position:0%
cacr17
on

03:40:18.389 --> 03:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:40:21.189 --> 03:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
statewide referendum powers only it was
 
03:40:21.199 --> 03:40:21.990 align:start position:0%
statewide referendum powers only it was
from

03:40:21.990 --> 03:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:40:23.750 --> 03:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
two sessions ago
 
03:40:23.760 --> 03:40:24.790 align:start position:0%
two sessions ago
so

03:40:24.790 --> 03:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:26.790 --> 03:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
it comes up so often we actually
 
03:40:28.469 --> 03:40:28.479 align:start position:0%
randomly can get the same number
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
assigned to it
 
03:40:31.590 --> 03:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
i also want to say and i don't know that
 
03:40:33.429 --> 03:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
this really came up my concern about
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:40:37.269 --> 03:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
and this process and i understand the
 
03:40:39.189 --> 03:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
desire for it
 
03:40:41.189 --> 03:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire is very local we
 
03:40:44.710 --> 03:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
have local elections i like to think um
 
03:40:48.309 --> 03:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
that that as a people we have very local
 
03:40:50.469 --> 03:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
control over what happens even up to the
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
state government and i think that this
 
03:40:52.800 --> 03:40:53.590 align:start position:0%
state government and i think that this
type

03:40:53.590 --> 03:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
type
 
03:40:55.830 --> 03:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
of an ability the ability to do this
 
03:40:57.189 --> 03:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
type of thing
 
03:41:01.349 --> 03:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
um would encourage out of state money
 
03:41:04.630 --> 03:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:04.640 --> 03:41:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
issues

03:41:05.910 --> 03:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:41:08.950 --> 03:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
directly by virtue of the power of the
 
03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
dollar as compared through legislation
 
03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
which is i view much more the power of
 
03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
the people so um i
 
03:41:20.950 --> 03:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
v i understand the need for this but
 
03:41:23.429 --> 03:41:23.439 align:start position:0%
in a state governed the way it is i am
 
03:41:26.710 --> 03:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
not sure it is appropriate
 
03:41:29.510 --> 03:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
anything else before i call the vote
 
03:41:30.790 --> 03:41:30.800 align:start position:0%

uh very briefly madam chairman um it's
 
03:43:24.790 --> 03:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
not the right time for this legislation
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
it should be something that we should
 
03:43:27.590 --> 03:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
consider in the future um you know
 
03:43:28.870 --> 03:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes these sponsors can get a
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
little off the wall but i think it's
 
03:43:35.590 --> 03:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:37.830 --> 03:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm
 
03:43:40.150 --> 03:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
i just want to echo that uh sometimes
 
03:43:41.670 --> 03:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
the sponsors can be a little off the
 
03:43:41.680 --> 03:43:46.070 align:start position:0%
the sponsors can be a little off the
wall

03:43:46.070 --> 03:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:48.229 --> 03:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
so i will also be both uh i'm putting
 
03:43:48.239 --> 03:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
so i will also be both uh i'm putting
itl

03:43:50.820 --> 03:43:50.830 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:50.830 --> 03:43:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:43:55.920 --> 03:43:57.269 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
um

03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:59.429 --> 03:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the the persons who
 
03:44:03.510 --> 03:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
moved this and seconded this um
 
03:44:06.070 --> 03:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
i when i looked at this bill i pondered
 
03:44:06.080 --> 03:44:07.429 align:start position:0%
i when i looked at this bill i pondered
in

03:44:07.429 --> 03:44:07.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:44:09.349 --> 03:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
the second year of the session going
 
03:44:11.349 --> 03:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
into elections where we would find three
 
03:44:14.070 --> 03:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
members of the senate governor and
 
03:44:16.469 --> 03:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
secretary of state that would be willing
 
03:44:18.469 --> 03:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
to to serve on this
 
03:44:19.990 --> 03:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
03:44:23.110 --> 03:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
underlying this there might be a
 
03:44:25.670 --> 03:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
question about whether
 
03:44:28.630 --> 03:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
allowing elections to be held all at the
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
same time of year instead of going
 
03:44:32.469 --> 03:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
through what we're going through now
 
03:44:34.710 --> 03:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
which is elections in march
 
03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
might be something that would be
 
03:44:37.910 --> 03:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
interesting to look at
 
03:44:37.920 --> 03:44:38.710 align:start position:0%
interesting to look at
um

03:44:38.710 --> 03:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:41.189 --> 03:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
but i agree that
 
03:44:43.189 --> 03:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
this is probably not appropriate at this
 
03:44:45.269 --> 03:44:45.279 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
03:44:47.670 --> 03:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
any further discussion yeah
 
03:44:49.670 --> 03:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
fortunately there are not minutes taken
 
03:44:52.389 --> 03:44:52.399 align:start position:0%

may be watching um i want to thank
 
03:46:03.670 --> 03:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney who participated
 
03:46:06.070 --> 03:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
in the motion and voted it was if you're
 
03:46:07.510 --> 03:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
not watching you if you're watching you
 
03:46:09.830 --> 03:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
don't know this the bill we just
 
03:46:09.840 --> 03:46:11.269 align:start position:0%
don't know this the bill we just
essentially

03:46:11.269 --> 03:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:46:14.070 --> 03:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
said go away to was a bill proposed by
 
03:46:14.080 --> 03:46:14.950 align:start position:0%
said go away to was a bill proposed by
him

03:46:14.950 --> 03:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
him
 
03:46:14.960 --> 03:46:16.070 align:start position:0%
him
so

03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:18.150 --> 03:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
hence the little joviality here we were
 
03:46:19.670 --> 03:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
not trying to be disrespectful to
 
03:46:19.680 --> 03:46:21.510 align:start position:0%
not trying to be disrespectful to
anybody

03:46:21.510 --> 03:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
03:46:23.510 --> 03:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
well maybe some people were trying to be
 
03:46:23.520 --> 03:46:27.510 align:start position:0%
well maybe some people were trying to be
disrespectful

03:46:27.510 --> 03:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:28.790 --> 03:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
all right the next bill we have
 
03:46:32.030 --> 03:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
scheduled for executive session is hb
 
03:46:32.040 --> 03:46:33.670 align:start position:0%

03:46:41.030 --> 03:46:41.040 align:start position:0%

03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
tennessee maine and new hampshire where
 
03:47:00.880 --> 03:47:02.870 align:start position:0%
tennessee maine and new hampshire where
these

03:47:02.870 --> 03:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:47:05.110 --> 03:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional officers are selected by
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
03:47:10.389 --> 03:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
and the experience in maine where i
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
spoke to
 
03:47:14.150 --> 03:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
bruce peliquin he's you probably all
 
03:47:15.990 --> 03:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
know him as the former congressman from
 
03:47:19.110 --> 03:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
maine but prior to that he was
 
03:47:20.790 --> 03:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
he was the treasurer of maine and then
 
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
prior to that he was in the financial
 
03:47:25.750 --> 03:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
services business spoke to the treasurer
 
03:47:27.030 --> 03:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
of maine
 
03:47:29.429 --> 03:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
a man named mr shapiro um
 
03:47:31.110 --> 03:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
this was many this is back in the early
 
03:47:34.950 --> 03:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
80s and mr shapiro had a pack
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
and was
 
03:47:39.189 --> 03:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
requesting money for that pack
 
03:47:39.199 --> 03:47:40.070 align:start position:0%
requesting money for that pack
and

03:47:40.070 --> 03:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:47:42.630 --> 03:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
he mr peliquin was quite surprised about
 
03:47:45.030 --> 03:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
that because of the conflict of interest
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
and not long after that the um the
 
03:47:50.710 --> 03:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
legislature in maine passed a bill very
 
03:47:53.189 --> 03:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
similar to the one that we uh have here
 
03:47:55.990 --> 03:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
today in front of us and for that reason
 
03:47:58.389 --> 03:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
um i believe that this should be uh this
 
03:48:00.950 --> 03:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
should this this should pass and
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
i'd be voting yes on ought to pass
 
03:48:06.070 --> 03:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative o'brien anyone
 
03:48:08.469 --> 03:48:08.479 align:start position:0%
else uh wish to comment on this
 
03:48:11.429 --> 03:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
motion mr westchester yes
 
03:48:13.349 --> 03:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcdonald
 
03:48:15.510 --> 03:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
i'll be voting against the uh the motion
 
03:48:18.550 --> 03:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
of vote to pass we took this up uh
 
03:48:21.349 --> 03:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
i think most recently in 2019
 
03:48:24.309 --> 03:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
and um at that time it was pointed out
 
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
that the right to participate in
 
03:48:26.870 --> 03:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
democracy through political
 
03:48:29.429 --> 03:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
contributions has been protected by the
 
03:48:31.030 --> 03:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
first amendment and that was the supreme
 
03:48:34.469 --> 03:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
court's ruling in buckley versus vallejo
 
03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
so in addition to to acknowledging that
 
03:48:39.349 --> 03:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
we do have a first amendment right to
 
03:48:42.150 --> 03:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
raise funds for campaign purposes i
 
03:48:43.189 --> 03:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
would just note that the way the
 
03:48:46.389 --> 03:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
legislation is written
 
03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
it may prohibit the candidate from
 
03:48:49.990 --> 03:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
forming a political committee but that
 
03:48:52.150 --> 03:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that no one else can do it
 
03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
on their behalf
 
03:48:55.189 --> 03:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
and then just donate the funds to the
 
03:48:57.510 --> 03:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
person running for that office so
 
03:48:59.670 --> 03:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
i don't see where the legislation would
 
03:49:01.830 --> 03:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
be effective and i also believe it
 
03:49:04.389 --> 03:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
would not stand up to a constitutional
 
03:49:04.399 --> 03:49:07.030 align:start position:0%
would not stand up to a constitutional
challenge

03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:09.750 --> 03:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
03:49:11.830 --> 03:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
o'brien thank you i just want to add to
 
03:49:14.229 --> 03:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
that not exactly um in response to mr
 
03:49:15.429 --> 03:49:15.439 align:start position:0%

in tennessee that i spoke to back when i
first

03:49:23.670 --> 03:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill a few years ago
 
03:49:28.550 --> 03:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
said the uh the state the state
 
03:49:30.150 --> 03:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
legislature in tennessee would would
 
03:49:32.710 --> 03:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
write him out on you know on
 
03:49:34.950 --> 03:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
out of town if he tried to
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
create a political action committee in
 
03:49:39.030 --> 03:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
running for secretary of state
 
03:49:41.429 --> 03:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
just a smaller legislature maybe
 
03:49:44.150 --> 03:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
education among the the members is is a
 
03:49:44.160 --> 03:49:44.950 align:start position:0%
education among the the members is is a
little

03:49:44.950 --> 03:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
little
 
03:49:46.710 --> 03:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
different the way that that goes they
 
03:49:48.389 --> 03:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
have fewer newcomers each year for
 
03:49:48.399 --> 03:49:50.070 align:start position:0%
have fewer newcomers each year for
example

03:49:50.070 --> 03:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
example
 
03:49:50.080 --> 03:49:51.269 align:start position:0%
example
so

03:49:51.269 --> 03:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:54.550 --> 03:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
that was one of the concerns in addition
 
03:49:56.870 --> 03:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's a whole month two months month
 
03:49:58.870 --> 03:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
and a half or so between when people are
 
03:50:01.110 --> 03:50:01.120 align:start position:0%

03:50:10.710 --> 03:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
position enough time to contact each and
 
03:50:12.309 --> 03:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
every one of us even though there are a
 
03:50:14.309 --> 03:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
lot of us that they do have the option
 
03:50:16.150 --> 03:50:16.160 align:start position:0%

03:52:46.710 --> 03:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
this bill reduces by two-thirds the

hampshire
 
03:52:57.910 --> 03:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony that this would
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
very likely crowd the ballots make it
 
03:53:02.229 --> 03:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
make the ballots more
 
03:53:03.670 --> 03:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
03:53:05.349 --> 03:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
and i can particularly understand that
 
03:53:09.429 --> 03:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
in races like
 
03:53:12.309 --> 03:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
president united states senator governor
 
03:53:14.950 --> 03:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
where under this bill only a thousand
 
03:53:16.870 --> 03:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
registered voters would be required for
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
those nomination papers
 
03:53:22.309 --> 03:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
i think that the current threshold that
 
03:53:24.870 --> 03:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
we have in law are adequate and they
 
03:53:27.110 --> 03:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
should remain
 
03:53:29.189 --> 03:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on hb
 
03:53:29.199 --> 03:53:32.469 align:start position:0%

sponsor of this talked about how it was
 
03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
very simple and clarified just as to

where the location of the challengers
 
03:55:45.990 --> 03:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
was as is often the case when i look at
 
03:55:47.110 --> 03:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
03:55:48.950 --> 03:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
what one party thinks is simple and
 
03:55:52.389 --> 03:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
clarifies i think might cloud the issue
 
03:55:55.349 --> 03:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
so i had a discussion with the sponsor
 
03:55:57.590 --> 03:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to clarify two things
 
03:55:59.189 --> 03:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
because i felt the bill as written did
 
03:56:00.790 --> 03:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
not do it
 
03:56:04.389 --> 03:56:04.399 align:start position:0%
um one was in regards to
 
03:56:06.630 --> 03:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
being close to the location where
 
03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
ballots are hand counted and ballots are
 
03:56:11.990 --> 03:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
hand counted or
 
03:56:14.309 --> 03:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons one is for
 
03:56:14.319 --> 03:56:15.910 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons one is for
tabulation

03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
tabulation
 
03:56:17.590 --> 03:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
and one is to count the number of
 
03:56:17.600 --> 03:56:19.590 align:start position:0%
and one is to count the number of
ballots

03:56:19.590 --> 03:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
03:56:22.710 --> 03:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
and those occur at two
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
different times or places in a polling
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
place i know in my polling place when we
 
03:56:28.950 --> 03:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
are going through the ballot set of each
 
03:56:31.030 --> 03:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
machine at the end of the night we have
 
03:56:32.630 --> 03:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
round tables set up in a number of
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
locations in the gymnasium and there
 
03:56:36.630 --> 03:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
would really be no effective way of
 
03:56:38.469 --> 03:56:38.479 align:start position:0%
putting anybody within six feet of those
 
03:56:40.070 --> 03:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
tables because we have a number of
 
03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
tables um going through just counting
 
03:56:46.469 --> 03:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
the physical ballot as compared to
 
03:56:48.389 --> 03:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh ballots that are rejected by the
 
03:56:48.399 --> 03:56:49.349 align:start position:0%
uh ballots that are rejected by the
machine

03:56:49.349 --> 03:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
machine
 
03:56:51.189 --> 03:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
over voted ballots which are being
 
03:56:53.429 --> 03:56:53.439 align:start position:0%
looked at by
 
03:56:55.590 --> 03:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
workers at the polls which is a
 
03:56:58.469 --> 03:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
different exercise than counting so i
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
spoke to the sponsor to clarify what his
 
03:57:03.670 --> 03:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
intent was and the intent was to be able
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
to watch
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
where a completed ballot is being
 
03:57:09.830 --> 03:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
interpreted by an election worker for
 
03:57:11.750 --> 03:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
the purposes of counting
 
03:57:15.590 --> 03:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
so i asked ols to make a change to that
 
03:57:17.750 --> 03:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
so i had them change the language to
 
03:57:19.830 --> 03:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
provide that it would be for the hand
 
03:57:22.070 --> 03:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
counting of ballots for the tabulation
 
03:57:23.670 --> 03:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
of votes
 
03:57:25.510 --> 03:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the night when
 
03:57:28.150 --> 03:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
we're counting our piles of 25 and cross
 
03:57:29.590 --> 03:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
changing them i don't know that anybody
 
03:57:32.710 --> 03:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
really cares about viewing that
 
03:57:35.590 --> 03:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
the second thing was the regards to the
 
03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
line of sight for an electronic ballot
 
03:57:39.830 --> 03:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
counting device um
 
03:57:42.389 --> 03:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
i didn't um oh excuse me in the the
 
03:57:46.309 --> 03:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
second part of that was the language
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
was uh within
 
03:57:52.070 --> 03:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
stand within six feet
 
03:57:54.550 --> 03:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
and i just was uncomfortable with that
 
03:57:56.630 --> 03:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
language and i asked them to change the
 
03:57:59.429 --> 03:57:59.439 align:start position:0%
language of not more than six feet um
 
03:58:01.269 --> 03:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
because i didn't want people to be able
 
03:58:03.670 --> 03:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
to say i want to be a foot within six
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
feet i wanted to have the limit that the
 
03:58:10.389 --> 03:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:10.399 --> 03:58:11.429 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:58:11.429 --> 03:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:58:13.269 --> 03:58:13.279 align:start position:0%
those were the two changes that were
 
03:58:14.950 --> 03:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
made i didn't really think that there
 
03:58:16.870 --> 03:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
was an issue in regards to maintaining a
 
03:58:19.030 --> 03:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
lighter line of sight on the actual
 
03:58:21.510 --> 03:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
ballot counting machines
 
03:58:24.150 --> 03:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
that seems pretty straightforward
 
03:58:26.710 --> 03:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
and there's no requirement in my opinion
 
03:58:28.550 --> 03:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
to be close to that to see that they're
 
03:58:30.950 --> 03:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
operating or who's
 
03:58:33.750 --> 03:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
using them just approaching it
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
so that those were the reasons that you
 
03:58:38.630 --> 03:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
have an amendment before you
 
03:58:40.550 --> 03:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
questions or discussion question
 
03:58:42.630 --> 03:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
chair um just for clarification
 
03:58:47.510 --> 03:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
you said the intent of the amendment is
 
03:58:47.520 --> 03:58:48.389 align:start position:0%
you said the intent of the amendment is
to

03:58:48.389 --> 03:58:48.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:58:48.399 --> 03:58:49.269 align:start position:0%
to
uh

03:58:49.269 --> 03:58:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:58:51.590 --> 03:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
just allow for the watching or the close
 
03:58:53.830 --> 03:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
viewing of the actual counting of the
 
03:58:53.840 --> 03:58:54.870 align:start position:0%
viewing of the actual counting of the
ballots

03:58:54.870 --> 03:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
03:58:57.429 --> 03:58:57.439 align:start position:0%
um so one of the diverters have been
 
03:58:59.030 --> 03:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
removed from the accuvope machines in
 
03:59:01.189 --> 03:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
most towns and cities and so now
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
election officials have to physically
 
03:59:04.630 --> 03:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
sort through all those ballots to find
 
03:59:06.870 --> 03:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
any with write-ins
 
03:59:08.469 --> 03:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
that work wouldn't necessarily have to
 
03:59:10.630 --> 03:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
be within six feet of observers that
 
03:59:12.070 --> 03:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
would be my position that's why i
 
03:59:14.630 --> 03:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
specifically tied it to tabulating votes
 
03:59:19.590 --> 03:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:21.510 --> 03:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative hamlet
 
03:59:24.150 --> 03:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
 
03:59:27.590 --> 03:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
does this mean that the moderator could
 
03:59:29.429 --> 03:59:29.439 align:start position:0%
set a limit of
 
03:59:31.590 --> 03:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
four feet they can't
 
03:59:33.349 --> 03:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
right does it he couldn't set a limit of
 
03:59:34.710 --> 03:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
eight feet
 
03:59:36.550 --> 03:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
he couldn't set eight feet but anything
 
03:59:36.560 --> 03:59:37.830 align:start position:0%
he couldn't set eight feet but anything
up

03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:59:40.070 --> 03:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
six feet but if if he said it at six
 
03:59:40.080 --> 03:59:41.110 align:start position:0%
six feet but if if he said it at six
feet

03:59:41.110 --> 03:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
feet
 
03:59:42.710 --> 03:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
i think the other one it would have been
 
03:59:45.670 --> 03:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
five you know five eleven there there
 
03:59:48.070 --> 03:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
could have been at least a discussion
 
03:59:51.510 --> 03:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
about no i wanna be closer i i wanted to
 
03:59:53.269 --> 03:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
make it clear that it was something that
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
could be set within the six feet
 
03:59:55.680 --> 03:59:56.469 align:start position:0%
could be set within the six feet
and

03:59:56.469 --> 03:59:56.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
it would be what it was going to be
 
04:00:01.670 --> 04:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
right so for the question sure so
 
04:00:03.030 --> 04:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
so the um
 
04:00:05.030 --> 04:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
if the challenger said i i want i need
 
04:00:07.830 --> 04:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
to stand one foot away so i can see
 
04:00:10.389 --> 04:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
the moderator has the option to go up to
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
six feet yeah
 
04:00:12.239 --> 04:00:13.269 align:start position:0%
six feet yeah
okay

04:00:13.269 --> 04:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:00:13.279 --> 04:00:16.229 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

04:00:16.229 --> 04:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:00:20.469 --> 04:00:20.479 align:start position:0%
i have to tell you 20 years ago i
 
04:00:22.229 --> 04:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
probably would have thought six feet was
 
04:00:24.309 --> 04:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
way too close but as i get older i think
 
04:00:29.429 --> 04:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:32.469 --> 04:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the amendment
 
04:00:33.990 --> 04:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to ask the clerk
 
04:00:37.110 --> 04:00:37.120 align:start position:0%

04:00:40.630 --> 04:00:40.640 align:start position:0%

representative sweeney uh yes thank you
 
04:04:53.429 --> 04:04:53.439 align:start position:0%
madam chair very briefly uh this bill
 
04:04:56.070 --> 04:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
would change the threshold for
 
04:04:58.870 --> 04:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
party access to the ballot uh from four
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
or party recognition in the state of new
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire excuse me from the current
 
04:05:04.710 --> 04:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
four percent threshold in the preceding
 
04:05:06.229 --> 04:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
statewide election
 
04:05:08.070 --> 04:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
to just one percent in the preceding
 
04:05:10.150 --> 04:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
statewide election
 
04:05:13.030 --> 04:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
we have a fairly simple system in new
 
04:05:15.189 --> 04:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire for third party candidates to
 
04:05:17.349 --> 04:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
get on the ballot to prove with
 
04:05:19.269 --> 04:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
signature petitions that they can
 
04:05:21.030 --> 04:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
currently get on the ballot and if a
 
04:05:23.189 --> 04:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
third party candidate does not meet the
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
sufficient signature requirements we
 
04:05:27.030 --> 04:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
then go a step further and allow for
 
04:05:29.429 --> 04:05:29.439 align:start position:0%
write-in candidacies for any office on
 
04:05:30.469 --> 04:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
the ballot
 
04:05:32.710 --> 04:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
if someone were so motivated to organize
 
04:05:34.550 --> 04:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
their campaign that way
 
04:05:36.790 --> 04:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
in recent years we've seen a third party
 
04:05:36.800 --> 04:05:37.750 align:start position:0%
in recent years we've seen a third party
achieve

04:05:37.750 --> 04:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
04:05:39.750 --> 04:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
party recognition status in the save new
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire in 2016 the libertarian party
 
04:05:43.830 --> 04:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
had more than four percent in the
 
04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial election
 
04:05:47.990 --> 04:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
and they gained party recognition status
 
04:05:49.830 --> 04:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh but they were not able to maintain it
 
04:05:51.830 --> 04:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
and they lost it after the 2018
 
04:05:51.840 --> 04:05:53.030 align:start position:0%
and they lost it after the 2018
elections

04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
elections
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
so i think currently our our laws on
 
04:05:57.510 --> 04:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
party recognition are fair uh and this
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
proposal and any of the amendments that
 
04:06:01.750 --> 04:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
were associated with this bill do not
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
need to go into effect at this point
 
04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:06:07.830 --> 04:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on hb
 
04:06:07.840 --> 04:06:09.349 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on hb
1197

04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
1197
 
04:06:11.750 --> 04:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you i
 
04:06:14.229 --> 04:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
agree with representative sweeney
 
04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
and i would just add though while there
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
are some who might feel that the four
 
04:06:20.309 --> 04:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
percent is a high threshold uh the one
 
04:06:21.670 --> 04:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
percent that's proposed in this
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
legislation is by all means much too low
 
04:06:26.550 --> 04:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
and therefore i'll support the emotion
 
04:06:30.870 --> 04:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:38.070 --> 04:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
i got to figure out when we don't need
 
04:06:42.710 --> 04:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
if there's no further discussion i'm
 
04:06:49.030 --> 04:06:49.040 align:start position:0%

04:08:20.229 --> 04:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
to legislate for house bill 1252 is
 
04:08:22.630 --> 04:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
04:08:24.070 --> 04:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'll say that
 
04:08:26.469 --> 04:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sweeney would
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion
 
04:08:31.269 --> 04:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
representative terosian yes thank you
 
04:08:34.469 --> 04:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
so i actually like many parts of this
 
04:08:34.479 --> 04:08:36.469 align:start position:0%
so i actually like many parts of this
bill

04:08:36.469 --> 04:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
i think the intent is good
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
i certainly
 
04:08:43.750 --> 04:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it's good practice for
 
04:08:45.990 --> 04:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
businesses to take state money and then
 
04:08:47.830 --> 04:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
contribute money to candidates that are
 
04:08:49.349 --> 04:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
going to ensure you know in particular
 
04:08:50.790 --> 04:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
in a grant that are going to ensure that
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
that grant continues
 
04:08:54.870 --> 04:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
so however the
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
as the language is written it's just too
 
04:08:56.560 --> 04:08:57.670 align:start position:0%
as the language is written it's just too
broad

04:08:57.670 --> 04:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
broad
 
04:08:57.680 --> 04:08:58.469 align:start position:0%
broad
so

04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:58.479 --> 04:08:59.670 align:start position:0%
so
i

04:08:59.670 --> 04:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:09:01.349 --> 04:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
hope that the
 
04:09:01.359 --> 04:09:02.389 align:start position:0%
hope that the
uh

04:09:02.389 --> 04:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:04.550 --> 04:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor and or other people next term
 
04:09:06.309 --> 04:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
considered bringing something back that
 
04:09:08.790 --> 04:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
that i could support with title language
 
04:09:11.429 --> 04:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
but at this time it's it's not doable so
 
04:09:15.269 --> 04:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
hence the motion of itl thank you
 
04:09:16.710 --> 04:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
does anybody else want to speak to the
 
04:09:16.720 --> 04:09:21.110 align:start position:0%
does anybody else want to speak to the
motion

04:09:21.110 --> 04:09:21.120 align:start position:0%

work out the uh
 
04:11:01.189 --> 04:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
the issues um so that it's a it's a more

streamlined process for the town clerks
 
04:11:06.790 --> 04:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
and the supervisors just the town clerks

so that we can all we can execute the
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
attention of the legislation that we
 
04:11:14.309 --> 04:11:14.319 align:start position:0%
passed without having to overburden them
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
all right i am going to honor that
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
request and we are going to continue
 
04:11:21.910 --> 04:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
executive session on 1383 to
 
04:11:24.389 --> 04:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
allow time for further work
 
04:11:28.149 --> 04:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
the next bill scheduled is 1567
 
04:11:28.159 --> 04:11:30.309 align:start position:0%
the next bill scheduled is 1567
and

04:11:30.309 --> 04:11:30.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:33.030 --> 04:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
i am actually asking the
 
04:11:34.469 --> 04:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
letting the committee know that i am
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
asking for a continuance and going to
 
04:11:38.309 --> 04:11:38.319 align:start position:0%
reschedule this so i can work on an
 
04:11:40.149 --> 04:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
amendment for this you already have an
 
04:11:45.349 --> 04:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
this spill is in regards to the removal
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
of election officials from office
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
this bill was amended to try to address
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment we have some of the
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
concerns that were brought to us in uh
 
04:11:58.319 --> 04:11:59.750 align:start position:0%
concerns that were brought to us in uh
public

04:11:59.750 --> 04:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on this
 
04:12:04.469 --> 04:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
however i i think there are some other
 
04:12:06.389 --> 04:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
things that maybe might be appropriate
 
04:12:08.870 --> 04:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
to try to do in regards to the
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
performance of duties of by election
 
04:12:12.630 --> 04:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
officials within
 
04:12:15.429 --> 04:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
their own municipality that may stop
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
short of removal and i would like an
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to explore to see if an
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
amendment could be done so with that
 
04:12:25.269 --> 04:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
our executive session for today is
 
04:12:25.279 --> 04:12:27.030 align:start position:0%
our executive session for today is
finished

04:12:27.030 --> 04:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
finished
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
going forward committee members as you
 
04:12:31.910 --> 04:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
know we have session next week on the
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
session for this committee next week
 
04:12:43.269 --> 04:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:12:45.670 --> 04:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
actually and i don't quite know how this
 
04:12:48.950 --> 04:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
happened i believe we have one bill left
 
04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
for public hearing i don't know quite
 
04:12:53.670 --> 04:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
how my scheduling managed to do that
 
04:12:57.269 --> 04:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
so 1163 relative to over voted ballots
 
04:12:58.950 --> 04:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
unless somebody remembers the public
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:06.389 --> 04:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
well no no we have other i'm talking
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
about public hearings
 
04:13:09.750 --> 04:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
so we have one bill that we have not had
 
04:13:11.269 --> 04:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
a public hearing on as far as the
 
04:13:12.630 --> 04:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
records show
 
04:13:14.630 --> 04:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
04:13:17.670 --> 04:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh exact at this point about half of our
 
04:13:17.680 --> 04:13:18.790 align:start position:0%
uh exact at this point about half of our
bills

04:13:18.790 --> 04:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:13:21.510 --> 04:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
so i am anticipating a meeting either
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
the last week in february or the first
 
04:13:26.229 --> 04:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
week in march as soon as i said it i
 
04:13:28.149 --> 04:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
will let you know regardless of getting
 
04:13:29.670 --> 04:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
things into the calendar to deal with
 
04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
the last public hearing an executive
 
04:13:35.110 --> 04:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
session on on i'm hoping many of the
 
04:13:35.120 --> 04:13:36.149 align:start position:0%
session on on i'm hoping many of the
bills

04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:13:39.269 --> 04:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
and then we will be having one meeting
 
04:13:41.830 --> 04:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
either the 9th or 10th
 
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
of march after town meetings
 
04:13:47.189 --> 04:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
most town meetings will have occurred
 
04:13:50.710 --> 04:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
because our report out date is the 10th
 
04:13:52.870 --> 04:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
um so it will have to be the 9th or the
 
04:13:54.870 --> 04:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
10th but i there are certain bills that
 
04:13:56.149 --> 04:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:13:57.429 --> 04:13:57.439 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate for the committee
 
04:13:59.670 --> 04:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
to address after town meetings occur so
 
04:14:01.349 --> 04:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
that is a plan i will let you know as
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
soon as i have figured out when we're
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
going to meet the last week in february
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
first week in march and i will let you
 
04:14:08.309 --> 04:14:08.319 align:start position:0%
know as soon as i figure out whether it
 
04:14:10.630 --> 04:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
is the 9th or the 10th and with that
 
04:14:13.030 --> 04:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming today uh
 
04:14:15.189 --> 04:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
this meeting is adjourned thank you for
 
04:14:18.070 --> 04:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
