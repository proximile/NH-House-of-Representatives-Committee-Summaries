were handed a document I hope you guys

read it that's this document for those

highlight
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
talks about our spending and on page two
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
in a very nice pie chart it describes
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
our spending as
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:16.379 align:start position:0%
several Pages after that it points out
 
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
our revenue for General funds
 
00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:22.379 align:start position:0%
that's 3.73
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
billion a shortage of 220 million
 
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.190 align:start position:0%
billion a shortage of 220 million
dollars

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
in my household we don't choose to spend
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
more than we take in because that leads
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
to things like bankruptcy that's not
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
our state benefited
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
because we had revenues that were above
 
00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
projections because we had cut certain
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
taxes the economy was doing well
 
00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
the last legislature underestimated
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
revenues and with all of that we ended
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
up with a significant balance
 
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
approximately 800 million dollars in
 
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue
 
00:35:05.329 --> 00:35:05.339 align:start position:0%
the last legislature and even some of
 
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
the bills this year use that in Wise
 
00:35:07.619 --> 00:35:09.470 align:start position:0%
the bills this year use that in Wise
ways

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
ways
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
but it did in fact
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
we can't count on all of that to prop us
 
00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.349 align:start position:0%
we can't count on all of that to prop us
up

00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
our spending needs to be below our
 
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.870 align:start position:0%
our spending needs to be below our
revenues

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:23.339 align:start position:0%
anything short of that is being fiscally
 
00:35:23.339 --> 00:35:27.589 align:start position:0%
anything short of that is being fiscally
irresponsible

00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
as a member of Finance
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
I had a decision to make I could have
 
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
voted nay on the on the auto pass motion
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
I chose not to show up that day and ask
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
for a substitute
 
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
I did that to respect my party
 
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
but I did want to point out
 
00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:47.579 align:start position:0%
that there are in fact
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of spending in this
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
budget it grows
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
over the last budget 18.2 percent
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of new spending
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
and that is not something that is
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible I would ask that
 
00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
you would oppose the committee Amendment
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
so that we can bring up another
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that puts us in line with the
 
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
rate of inflation and population growth
 
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
do you recognize the representative
 
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:24.170 align:start position:0%
do you recognize the representative
Weiler

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
when the governor gives me a proposal I
 
00:36:35.089 --> 00:36:35.099 align:start position:0%
don't call it the governor's budget I
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
call it the governor's input
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
for convenience I label them hp1 and hb2
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
and then we go and change them because
 
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
this is where the budget is created
 
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
that's what the Constitution says what
 
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
we do is the budget what everybody else
 
00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:53.579 align:start position:0%
does are changes
 
00:36:53.579 --> 00:36:54.770 align:start position:0%
does are changes
so

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
we have looked at
 
00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
a comparison now between let me explain
 
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
things I just think I heard of why
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
thing with the pie charts you have head
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
handed out
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
the money that will be appropriated and
 
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.589 align:start position:0%
the money that will be appropriated and
spent

00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
spent
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
and page
 
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.950 align:start position:0%
and page
five

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
which is what we expect to take in in
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
the next two years
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
so there's a difference of a couple
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
hundred million
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
but remember we expect
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
all our agencies not to spend everything
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
they should lapse some money
 
00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
and now that lapse comes into page two
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's the extra 200 million that's why
 
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:51.950 align:start position:0%
that's the extra 200 million that's why
that's

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
gives us more money to spend than what
 
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimates will be going
 
00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.329 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimates will be going
forward

00:37:59.329 --> 00:37:59.339 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:02.579 align:start position:0%
so we're very closely divided house
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
so we believe we put things in this
 
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
budget to please both sides
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear about that in the future
 
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.810 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear about that in the future
so

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
we want to expedite the retirement of
 
00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
the interest interest and dividends tax
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
and there's also
 
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
some big pay increases
 
00:38:26.829 --> 00:38:26.839 align:start position:0%
now when we compare the budget
 
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
2425 to what 2223 passed two years ago
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
that is a very different comparison to
 
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
what the actual spending is from 23
 
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
verses 24 25. it is not an 18 increase
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
from what is presently being spent in
 
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
this present biennium because there is
 
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
so much hundreds of millions of federal
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
money in Recovery Act and so on that
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
have salute this thing so the actual
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
increase over the the actual adjusted
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
authorized in this present budget is
 
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
more like seven percent
 
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
it's still a big increase but look at
 
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
what's happened in the last two years
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
I asked the LBA to compute
 
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
the inter the inflation adjustment which
 
00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:19.820 align:start position:0%
we normally use when we look at a budget
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
12.7 percent over the two years and then
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
when we use What's called the tax
 
00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
expenditure limitation we try not to
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
exceed the inflation rate for the
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
previous period plus the population
 
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
growth the population growth was one and
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
a half percent those two figures
 
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
together add up to 14.2 percent
 
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
that's a big increase that it's hired to
 
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.010 align:start position:0%
that's a big increase that it's hired to
overlook

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
overlook
 
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
so when the when the budget came to us
 
00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.510 align:start position:0%
so when the when the budget came to us
with

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
actually the input came to us
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
with a 10 percent increase in 24 and a
 
00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
two percent increase in 25.
 
00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
we didn't give an increase in the
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
previous budget but now that total 12
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
percent is roughly around the rate of
 
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.370 align:start position:0%
percent is roughly around the rate of
inflation

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
that's something you can't Overlook
 
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
we're all witnessing it at the gas pump
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%
the grocery store and all our electric
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
bills and every other Bill we pay
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
inflation is is not a good thing but
 
00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
we've got to face it
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
we've got to work with it thankfully the
 
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
revenue has come in well
 
00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
so we have the money
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
to cover what is needed even with the
 
00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
inflation adjustments we have to
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
understand that it's more than I'd like
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
to see an increase but
 
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
the same thing happens when I fill up my
 
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
gas tank I go to the grocery stores
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
it's not an increase I'd like to see but
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's reality we have to face reality and
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
adjust to it
 
00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.089 align:start position:0%
adjust to it
so

00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:50.099 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
the budget has a lot of things that are
 
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
different now the reason we talk about
 
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
hp2 before we talk about hb1 because in
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
that same Constitution it says hb1 can
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
only contain the spreadsheets in effect
 
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
the numbers that go with all the
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
agencies we have if you've looked at the
 
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
thousand plus pages that go in a hb1
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
each one is a spreadsheet for an agency
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
or part of an agency
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
if there's any change that takes place
 
00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
as I say we passed 50 bills out of this
 
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.870 align:start position:0%
as I say we passed 50 bills out of this
house

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
that are mostly included in the in the
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
budget and that added 165 million which
 
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
we've endeavored to include in the
 
00:41:34.609 --> 00:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
budget that we passed so that money is
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
there that helped to increase the budget
 
00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.349 align:start position:0%
there that helped to increase the budget
but

00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
we have to adjust to all these things as
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
and those are the realities so we're
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
giving a pay increase we're taking care
 
00:41:53.569 --> 00:41:53.579 align:start position:0%
of a problem from 2011 with mainly
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
affected group two
 
00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
that's going to be an expensive fix
 
00:41:59.170 --> 00:41:59.180 align:start position:0%
we're giving cost of living increase
 
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
those are things that are all pressured
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
by inflation
 
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
so I ask for your patience and
 
00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
understanding that we have a bill that
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
hp2 needs to pass because it contains
 
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
the enabling legislation so if there's
 
00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:20.180 align:start position:0%
any change in an organization of a
 
00:42:22.849 --> 00:42:22.859 align:start position:0%
department or
 
00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:26.420 align:start position:0%
people leaving people gaining new
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
equipment new
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of a lot of money spent on
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
information technology so all that has
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
written about in hp2 So it explains what
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheets contain and why all
 
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
those figures are there and mostly when
 
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
you look at hb2 hb1 it shows previous
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
year spending and then current
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
projection and there will be a
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
difference based upon many of those
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
bills we passed and many of the facts
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
that have come before us every virtually
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
every agency has said to us we can't
 
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
hire people we're losing people we're
 
00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:05.579 align:start position:0%
short people we have all these vacancies
 
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
in some ways those vacancies help us to
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
fund the pay increase
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
but they also make the dealing a little
 
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
bit harder for some of the agencies and
 
00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
we'll hear about it when people come to
 
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
us and say why do I have to wait so long
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
in line to get my registration for my
 
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.250 align:start position:0%
in line to get my registration for my
car

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
car
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
because they're short people
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's happening and almost every agency
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
will deal with let's hope this budget
 
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
will help to mend it so I ask for your
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
support and those things that seem out
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
of line with history because we need to
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
do that and another thing that I've been
 
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
questioned on was
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
I was fortunate to be here in 1999 when
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
we created the education trust fund and
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
created what we considered adequacy and
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
funded it
 
00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
and education trust fund was only there
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
to fund adequacy and we actually kept it
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit below what we needed
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
because if it went over that froze money
 
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
we couldn't spend elsewhere
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
so we had to adjust
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund it had gone a
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
while without being adjusted last budget
 
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
we took 100 million
 
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
out of the swept fund because it was
 
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
producing so much money
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
we're back down about a third of the
 
00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
enrollment from 20 years ago
 
00:44:29.089 --> 00:44:29.099 align:start position:0%
so you can't keep expecting to spend
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
more money on fewer people
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
meanwhile Medicaid is growing like crazy
 
00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
so there has to be a shift from some of
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
the funds still we spent more on
 
00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
education than we have in the past so
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
I've adjusted the
 
00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:47.099 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund so we don't tie
 
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
up money that we would need somewhere
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
else because the education trust fund
 
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
takes a piece a big piece of the general
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
fund we need that money in the general
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
fund because sometimes we add it to the
 
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game fund sometimes we add it
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
to the highway fund depending on how bad
 
00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
the weather is every year
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
so hp2 this amendment before you
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
if you are supporting any further
 
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment you've got to vote for this
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise those further amendments are
 
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
meaningless they'll be referring to a
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
section that no longer exists
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
so hb2
 
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment must be passed
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
you understand why because all the rest
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
of it is meaningless if we don't I thank
 
00:45:35.089 --> 00:45:35.099 align:start position:0%
you for your attention as a member of
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you Mr

chairman for taking my question is it
 
00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
correct that this budget presented to us
 
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
by the finance committee is balanced
 
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
that it contains no new taxes and fees
 
00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
and that it in fact contains a small tax
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:02.220 align:start position:0%

also correct that much of what is
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
referred to as spending in this budget
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
is in fact paying down debt as well as
 
00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
paying for large capital projects that
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
would normally be included in the
 
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:23.339 align:start position:0%
capital budget and is in fact saving
 
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
so first of all I want to thank the
 
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
finance committee for all of their hard
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
work over the last several weeks I know
 
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
I can speak for most of us here that you
 
00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
couldn't probably pay me enough to do
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
what they do for free and we thank them
 
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
for their service and I hope they don't
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
look too kindly on uh or unkindly on
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
those of us who are now going to jump in
 
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:17.099 align:start position:0%
at the end of the fourth quarter and try
 
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
to run a few plays before the clock Runs
 
00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.050 align:start position:0%
to run a few plays before the clock Runs
Out

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
Out
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
um I took the opportunity yesterday to
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
sit down with my friend from Manchester
 
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:27.300 align:start position:0%
to hammer out a few things that that we
 
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
think will help smooth our way to uh to
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
a widespread yes vote on the uh ought to
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
pass as amended uh later on today
 
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
and maybe we'll uh induce some more
 
00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
withdrawals of some floor amendments
 
00:50:43.609 --> 00:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
that are that are still hanging out
 
00:50:43.619 --> 00:50:44.510 align:start position:0%
that are that are still hanging out
there

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh just real quickly uh to point out a
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
few of the things that are contained
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
within this amendment
 
00:50:51.359 --> 00:50:52.250 align:start position:0%
within this amendment
um

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
it was brought to my attention that we
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
had put some language into hb2 regarding
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
the efas that had passed on the house
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
floor that were sponsored by Republicans
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
and that there were some other EFA bills
 
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
sponsored by democrats that did not make
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
their way into hb2 and I just uh that
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
didn't sit right with me and it seems
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
unfair and I'm sure my friend from
 
00:51:17.569 --> 00:51:17.579 align:start position:0%
Manchester agreed with that so we uh we
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
agreed to pull that out of hb2
 
00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
and uh my friend was also kind enough to
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
allow us to put in to hb2 by this
 
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
amendment the language from HB 127 uh
 
00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:35.099 align:start position:0%
reforming uh the the state of emergency
 
00:51:35.099 --> 00:51:36.470 align:start position:0%
reforming uh the the state of emergency
procedures

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
real estate which we have passed in this
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
house a few times at this point so I I
 
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
appreciate my friend for uh for agreeing
 
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
to do that with me there's also a few
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
spending items that we added in there
 
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
that I think will uh will help smooth
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
things along today and there is a larger
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
item that I'm going to ask of the
 
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
education committee to speak about
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
having to do with adequacy funding this
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
was uh exactly the same as an amendment
 
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
that was going to be brought forth by uh
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
rep the leadership from the education
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee as well as the leadership from
 
00:52:10.849 --> 00:52:10.859 align:start position:0%
division two of finance and they all
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
agree that this is the way that we
 
00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:14.660 align:start position:0%
should be going
 
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
I think most of us will be agreeable to
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
what they're proposing
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
and uh so I'll turn it over to other
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
people to talk about that so thank you
 
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420 align:start position:0%

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:48.900 align:start position:0%

00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
the budget and deliver on key policy
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
priorities including affordable housing
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
public education and health care which
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
are all important to New Hampshire
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
families as well as New Hampshire
 
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.109 align:start position:0%
families as well as New Hampshire
employers

00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
let's start first with housing it's no
 
00:53:34.609 --> 00:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
secret that New Hampshire is in an
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
affordable housing crisis New
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's unhoused population is
 
00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:40.460 align:start position:0%
spiking and rent is continuing to rise
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
just this winter Mayors across the state
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
wrote to the governor expressing an
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
urgent need for more concerted support
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
for warming centers and shelters
 
00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire needs housing that our
 
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
Workforce our families and our seniors
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
can afford New Hampshire housing
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
estimates that we need 20 000 more
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
housing units and that number will
 
00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
continue to grow in the coming years
 
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
rents have risen by over 30 percent in
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
the last five years alone and Home
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
Ownership is Out Of Reach for many
 
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
emergency housing assistance for
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
individuals expired in March and a
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
recent report shows that rent is rising
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire faster than in most
 
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.349 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire faster than in most
States

00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
we need more funding for affordable
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
housing not less which is why I'm
 
00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
pleased that this bipartisan Amendment
 
00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
restores 15 million to the affordable
 
00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
housing fund
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
second is public education
 
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
this bipartisan Amendment maintains the

poverty
 
00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
it also brings down the line item for
 
00:54:47.809 --> 00:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
vouchers from 60 million to 40 million
 
00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:50.339 align:start position:0%
over the biennium freeing up funds to
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
reinvest in our Public Schools
 
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
Additionally the amendment includes
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
bipartisan lab luno school funding
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
formula which more adequately and
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
equitably supports our Public Schools
 
00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
especially in communities like Berlin
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
and Claremont that need it the most
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
third is health care right now hospitals
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
and community health centers are
 
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
struggling to care for granted Staters
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
because of Staffing and funding issues
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
pleased that this bipartisan amendment
 
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
makes impactful and data-driven
 
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
investments in our state's Health Care
 
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
System providing preventative physical
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
and mental health care is an important
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
way to keep patients out of our
 
00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:29.930 align:start position:0%
way to keep patients out of our
hospitals

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
this bipartisan amendment invests five
 
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars in system of care and
 
00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
two million dollars in the Family

the health care needs of our
 
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
constituents in their own homes and in
 
00:55:43.609 --> 00:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
their own communities
 
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
additionally Community Mental Health
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
leaders have made it clear if the
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement rate does not
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
increase over the next few years
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
psychiatric patients will continue to
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
suffer long wait times and low care
 
00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.190 align:start position:0%
suffer long wait times and low care
availability

00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
availability
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
this bipartisan Amendment invests an
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
additional 40 million dollars to boost
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid provider rates which will help
 
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
address our state's ability to attract
 
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
and retain the workforce that it needs
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
for our health care System
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker we need a budget that
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
reflects our priorities as a state and
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
that is fair to everyone
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan amendment makes critical
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
Investments to address our Statewide
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
housing crisis brings balance to our
 
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
public education system and delivers
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
community-based Health Care Solutions to
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of granite Staters by
 
00:56:31.609 --> 00:56:31.619 align:start position:0%
bolstering its Workforce
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
it's also a testament to the fact that
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
when we come together in good faith and
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
we listen to one another we disagree
 
00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
without being disagreeable and find
 
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
common ground and compromise where we
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
can Republicans win Democrats win
 
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
but most importantly Granite Staters win
 
00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:50.339 align:start position:0%
because when we are able to deliver
 
00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:53.579 align:start position:0%
results on education housing and health
 
00:56:53.579 --> 00:56:55.970 align:start position:0%
results on education housing and health
care

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
those are the reasons that our
 
00:56:58.730 --> 00:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
constituents sent us here and it's
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
exactly what this bipartisan budget
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
amendment does that's why I'm urging my
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
vote Yes on this amendment so we can get
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
closer to delivering on a budget that
 
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
works for all Granite Staters thank you
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to thank the bipartisan
 
00:57:29.569 --> 00:57:29.579 align:start position:0%
group I had the opportunity to work with
 
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
in trying to craft legislation
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
that would best meet the needs of our
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
students throughout this state and so
 
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
thank you to the representative from
 
00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.309 align:start position:0%

Grafton County where I come from
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
in Rockingham the four of you including
 
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
myself I think did a remarkable job in
 
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
in trying to support our children
 
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
there is a handout which was in the back
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
the room in the ante room and most of
 
00:58:02.089 --> 00:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
you might have at this point in time
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
which reflects the proposal from our
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
governor and the proposal that came out
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
of Finance for hb2 and then a Amendment
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
which we're speaking about right now
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
1285 H which has been incorporated into
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment on the screen behind me
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
that is the floor amendment in which we
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
worked diligently over a number of days
 
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
and weeks in fact this goes right back
 
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
over years when I first came into this
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
house in 2008
 
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
when I looked at the Joint legislative
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
oversight group that costed out an
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
adequate education then in 2018
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
the formula that came out of that
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
education study committee and then in
 
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
2020 the commission report they all had
 
00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:56.180 align:start position:0%
some common
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
areas which we can come to agree on one
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
of those areas is yes we have to look at
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
the amount of funding we're providing
 
00:59:08.569 --> 00:59:08.579 align:start position:0%
education but even just as important and
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps even more important how we
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
distribute those funds to various
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
communities and municipalities
 
00:59:20.289 --> 00:59:20.299 align:start position:0%
on the spreadsheet you see there's 245
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities identified and you can
 
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
walk across and see how those monies are
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
allocated out
 
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
the formula which came out of the
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
finance committee and that which you see
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
in 1285 which is part of the amendment
 
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
on the screen behind you are almost
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
identical in the revenues needed to make
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
it work
 
00:59:46.809 --> 00:59:46.819 align:start position:0%
but the difference is that in the
 
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
formula that's on the board now and came
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
from that group of four that met
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
we looked at base cost of adequacy and
 
00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
the base cost is on the left hand side
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the formula the side of the formula
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
that every student every municipality in
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
the state receives that amount of money
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
per pupil
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
every time we increase Base adequacy by
 
01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:14.579 align:start position:0%
one hundred dollars that requires 16
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Appropriations to
 
01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.589 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Appropriations to
support

01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
when I learned that the formula that was
 
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
being presented earlier where we're
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
upping the Annie from thirty nine
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars to four thousand seven
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
that would have upped the Annie on the
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
left-hand side by 128 million dollars
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
is that where we need to be putting our
 
01:00:41.329 --> 01:00:41.339 align:start position:0%
adequacy money now Two Towns which
 
01:00:44.089 --> 01:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
receive perhaps in sweat money more
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
money than is necessary to cost out an
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
or should we be planning that money and
 
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
distributing to towns
 
01:00:56.049 --> 01:00:56.059 align:start position:0%
that need this because of a number of
 
01:00:58.849 --> 01:00:58.859 align:start position:0%
costing efficiencies
 
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
operational efficiencies unique
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
characteristics those municipalities
 
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
that was watching the budget in under
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity Aid in 2008 we
 
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
took it out in 2011. we've discussed it
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
in 2018 and 2020
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
this is what we have now coming back
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
into our budget where we're taking the
 
01:01:23.329 --> 01:01:23.339 align:start position:0%
monies and distributing it to the towns
 
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
the property poor towns that need that
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
support you will also notice in this
 
01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.430 align:start position:0%
support you will also notice in this
amendment

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
notes our community loses money the
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
majority of communities that need this
 
01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue are receiving it and that's well
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
over approximately 185 communities out
 
01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:44.339 align:start position:0%
of the 245.
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
secondly we looked at in this
 
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment the need to support our
 
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
Charter Public Schools as well
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
and our goal was of course Charter
 
01:01:59.450 --> 01:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
Public Schools are funded now on the
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
base amount that's the 3 900 in this
 
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
bill it's 40 40 4 000 dollars
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
differentiated eight is added into that
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
excluding the special education so that
 
01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
brings with the extra five thousand
 
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
dollars charter schools now will be
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
receiving per pupil nine thousand
 
01:02:19.849 --> 01:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
dollars plus those amounts in
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid that that child will
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
bring excluding special education
 
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
so our goal is not to have a broken
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
formula where stabilization
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
is there because we're not doing what we
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
should be doing on the left-hand side or
 
01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
even on the granting side we're now
 
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
allocating our resources to best support
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
our children in the state so I ask all
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
here today this is a bipartisan
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%

I am here to speak on behalf of this
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
amendment which preserves two years of
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
the interest and dividends reductions
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
but does not accelerate future cuts to
 
01:06:16.609 --> 01:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
the biennium which would be harmful to
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the IND tax the IND
 
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
tax is scheduled to be eliminated by
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
2027 in current law through a bill
 
01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
the IND tax is mostly paid by the
 
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
wealthiest granted Staters only 14
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
percent of granite stateers pay any IND
 
01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
tax and more than half of the revenue
 
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
comes from people receiving two hundred
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or more in interest in
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
dividend income
 
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
under our constitution every person is
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
meant to share in paying the cost of
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
government as they are able and we are
 
01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.789 align:start position:0%
government as they are able and we are
proposing

01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
01:06:55.799 --> 01:06:57.170 align:start position:0%
proposing
uh

01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:59.210 --> 01:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
in the budget we just passed to
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
eliminate the only tax that makes our
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
wealthiest citizen share in that burden
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax is our
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
fifth largest tax Moody's has been
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
giving us favorable ratings despite our
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
Decades of budget Cliffhangers partly
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
because of our Diversified tax system
 
01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
which helps us survive major crisis
 
01:07:26.329 --> 01:07:26.339 align:start position:0%
in the past hb2 Amendment this tax would
 
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
be eliminated entirely in this biennium
 
01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
by 2025.
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
those that are in support of
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
accelerating the IND phase out indicate
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
that the impact is 17.4 million in this
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
budget but almost all the revenue impact
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
will show up only in the following
 
01:07:49.609 --> 01:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
biennium 2627 and it'll be substantial
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
well not part of the legislature when
 
01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
the phase out was passed I heard some of
 
01:07:55.609 --> 01:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
the debates
 
01:07:55.619 --> 01:07:57.349 align:start position:0%
the debates
proponents

01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
proponents
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
of the phase out
 
01:08:01.609 --> 01:08:01.619 align:start position:0%
say there was warranted so that we could
 
01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:03.299 align:start position:0%
see what our needs are in the future
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
with our future budgets
 
01:08:08.089 --> 01:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
how the economy responds to the cuts and
 
01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
make adjustments is necessary
 
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
and now we hear both the governors and
 
01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:14.579 align:start position:0%
the ways and means expect flat revenues
 
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
and Rising costs with inflation for
 
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
needed services
 
01:08:21.169 --> 01:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
a phase out is originally sponsored
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
would provide us with the opportunity to
 
01:08:26.209 --> 01:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
react to the impacts of the change in
 
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
our ability to fund the necessary
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
government functions
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
our our finance share often said we have
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
to consider what financial needs we have
 
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
to address if circumstances change flat
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
revenues inflation put considerable
 
01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
pressure on the budget process this year
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
and be even more so in the next biennium
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
some of my colleagues state that the IND
 
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
tax is the best tax to cut that is the
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
most harmful to economic activity
 
01:08:56.689 --> 01:08:56.699 align:start position:0%
warranting even faster reduction I
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
disagree with that when I arrived in
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
Concord for this term it seemed almost
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
unanimous that the three highest
 
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
priorities to promote economic growth
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
and opportunity for granted State
 
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
Staters our Workforce expansion
 
01:09:11.329 --> 01:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
addressing housing shortages and
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
enhancing education funding for low
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
property value towns neither the
 
01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
reduction of or in particular the
 
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
hyper-accelerated elimination of the
 
01:09:22.849 --> 01:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
state's interest in dividends tax do
 
01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:23.809 align:start position:0%
state's interest in dividends tax do
that

01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
if you want to generate more housing
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to cut the taxes on
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
housing which is property taxes my
 
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
colleagues are fond of saying that when
 
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
you tax something you get less of it the
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
taxes granted Staters and our businesses
 
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
pay are predominantly property taxes
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
like no other state in the country
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
so I would maintain our if effort to
 
01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
reduce Granite State taxes should focus
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
on property which is the real
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
Battleground for promoting growth
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
accelerating the reduction in the IND
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
tax will not be helpful for that
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
look the IND tax phase out has begun
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment still keeps gigantic
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
decreases in the IND tax as planned when
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
passed implementing two years of
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
substantial cuts
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
with the an elevated risk of recession
 
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
in the in the coming years and the
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
potential rise for needed Services
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
driven by inflation public resources
 
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
must be conserved
 
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
please let's just take the win
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
please vote green which preserves the
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
two-year phase out of the Indy tax in
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
this biennium but not the total
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
elimination of the tax and this
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
important source of Revenue and general
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
funds in this biennium
 
01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much and I'd like a
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
division vote gear recognize this
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:10:50.689 --> 01:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker what are the advantages of
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
phasing out the IND tax sooner than
 
01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.050 align:start position:0%
phasing out the IND tax sooner than
later

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
there are many
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
first New Hampshire will actually be
 
01:10:59.570 --> 01:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
able to say it's an income tax-free
 
01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:00.709 align:start position:0%
able to say it's an income tax-free
state

01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:11:03.169 --> 01:11:03.179 align:start position:0%
second many think the amendment will
 
01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
restore 35 to 40 million tax dollars
 
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
over the coming biennium however that's
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
when we think about this statically we
 
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
need to think about this tax dynamically
 
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
for example what are the some of the
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
dynamic elements number one it's going
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
to stop the migration of wealthy New
 
01:11:26.689 --> 01:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirees to States like
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
Florida where Florida does not have an
 
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
income tax and they don't have an
 
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax
 
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
we'll encourage the migration of people
 
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
from heavily taxed states like New York
 
01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
California and Massachusetts to come
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
here and what's the advantage to that
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
well first of all let's be clear do
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
wealthy people stuff their mattresses
 
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
with cash
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
for the most part no right what are they
 
01:11:54.649 --> 01:11:54.659 align:start position:0%
doing with it they're they're putting
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
money in Banks
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
they're they're making Investments they
 
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.310 align:start position:0%
they're they're making Investments they
are

01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
investing in building and production
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
and they themselves are buying goods and
 
01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:07.310 align:start position:0%
and they themselves are buying goods and
services

01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
if that person moves to a state like
 
01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.490 align:start position:0%
if that person moves to a state like
Florida

01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
they're not going to invest in New
 
01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:12.590 align:start position:0%
they're not going to invest in New
Hampshire

01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
but if that person is in New Hampshire
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
that must much more likely to invest in
 
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses and in New
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
The increased Savings in in banks will
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
help people get the more money there is
 
01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
for loans possibly the better the loan
 
01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
rates more Builders can can get money
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
more easily as well
 
01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
there's also a fairness issue
 
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax is more
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
likely to hit the elderly and retired
 
01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
so why should they be burdened why
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
should they be burdened with the income
 
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
tax that we have right now in New
 
01:12:53.689 --> 01:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire let's get rid of it sooner
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
than later time is of the essence please
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
press the red button to stop this
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
amendment and make sure New Hampshire is
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
truly income tax free sooner than later
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chair recognizes
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.090 --> 01:13:13.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
the interest in as as the first Speaker
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
said I think that the interest in
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
dividends tax is the worst tax that we
 
01:13:25.729 --> 01:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
have why it's a tax on savings and
 
01:13:25.739 --> 01:13:26.830 align:start position:0%
have why it's a tax on savings and
investment

01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
savings is something we need more of not
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
less of and in fact we spend money to
 
01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
try to encourage savings we we try to
 
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
encourage building of housing we try to
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
encourage business we try to encourage
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
economic activity by spending money but
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
by taxing savings and taxing
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
accumulation of capital we are hurting
 
01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
the future we are hurting the things
 
01:13:58.450 --> 01:13:58.460 align:start position:0%
that grow
 
01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
buildings Capital
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire and
 
01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
therefore future tax revenue
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
I tried to think of a simple way of
 
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
illustrating this let's let's imagine a
 
01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
person with a million dollars of savings
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
and they go to their local bank
 
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
and invest it in a CD getting five
 
01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
percent all right something very simple
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
so they're making fifty thousand dollars
 
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
a year of income and let's suppose the
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax which is now
 
01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
four percent
 
01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
right so they're going to pay from that
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars of income two
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of tax
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
all right this bill in January of 2025
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
the house bill 2 in January 2025 would
 
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
eliminate that two thousand dollars of
 
01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:52.970 align:start position:0%
eliminate that two thousand dollars of
tax

01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:53.990 align:start position:0%
tax
okay

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
but what is the bank going to do with
 
01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
that million dollars of capital that
 
01:14:59.630 --> 01:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
they were just given
 
01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
the bank is going to loan that to
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who's going to build with it
 
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
right they're going to create housing
 
01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
they're going to create commercial
 
01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
property something like that they're
 
01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
going to create a million dollars worth
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
of property
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
now our property taxes are roughly two
 
01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.630 align:start position:0%
now our property taxes are roughly two
percent

01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
so we are going to collect on that
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars of property twenty
 
01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year in property
 
01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:29.390 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year in property
taxes

01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.669 align:start position:0%
taxes
so

01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
um we're comparing here two thousand
 
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
dollars of interest and dividends tax
 
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
for you know forgiven or gotten rid of
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
to twenty thousand dollars gain in in
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
all right now that might seem like well
 
01:15:53.689 --> 01:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
why can't we have both why can't we have
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
twenty two thousand dollars of tax
 
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
but the problem is people who invest and
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
have these kind of resources are mobile
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
I I certainly have friends who are no
 
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
longer Granite Staters because they've
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
moved to Florida specifically because of
 
01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
the interest and dividends tax
 
01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:17.149 align:start position:0%
the interest and dividends tax
okay

01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
this is particularly timely because of
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
what's Happening Now in Massachusetts
 
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.030 align:start position:0%
what's Happening Now in Massachusetts
Massachusetts

01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
first of all just in general
 
01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is losing roughly a
 
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
billion dollars a year of income people
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
people with income of a billion dollars
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
a year are fleeing Massachusetts and
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
when they do 50 percent of them move to
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
Florida 25 percent of them move here and
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
the other 25 percent move somewhere else
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
all right so Florida is getting twice as
 
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
many of the people who leave
 
01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as we are why is that
 
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any sense to me right
 
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
why would somebody go to the Heat
 
01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
the swamps the alligators
 
01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:15.709 align:start position:0%
the swamps the alligators
Etc

01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
when they could live in New Hampshire
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
without the traffic with the lakes with
 
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
the mountains all that nice stuff what's
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
the difference remember we'll spend the
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
house will be in order
 
01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
member has a right to be heard it's
 
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
what's the difference
 
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
right the difference is the interest in
 
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
dividends tax
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
right if you can go to Florida and not
 
01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:45.380 align:start position:0%
have your income taxed
 
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
maybe you'll do that instead of moving
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire
 
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
so we want those investments in New
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we want that capital in New
 
01:17:56.699 --> 01:17:58.310 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we want that capital in New
Hampshire

01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:00.659 align:start position:0%
and so this is particularly timely
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
because Massachusetts has just
 
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
put an extra large tax which is going to
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
force way more people out
 
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
and once they make the decision of where
 
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
to live
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to be their decision for a
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
long period of time so we should do this
 
01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.990 align:start position:0%
long period of time so we should do this
now

01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
it is not a large amount of money but
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
it's the kind of money that is seed
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
Capital Seed corn if you will for the
 
01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.990 align:start position:0%
Capital Seed corn if you will for the
economy

01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
and when we have Seed corn we don't want
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
to consume it
 
01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
we want to plant it we want to let it
 
01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:42.050 align:start position:0%
we want to plant it we want to let it
grow

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
grow
 
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
and so then we can consume the results
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:50.219 align:start position:0%

it is sufficiently seconded this will be

01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is floor Amendment
 
01:19:59.330 --> 01:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
1290 it's a roll call vote share
 
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Olney for a
 
01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
if I know that a lot of our citizens
 
01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
property taxes are much higher than two
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
percent of their income
 
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
and they would be surprised to know that
 
01:20:22.729 --> 01:20:22.739 align:start position:0%
other people don't have that problem if
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
I know that the state of our economy and
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
of our state's revenues over the next
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
two biennia is very fragile
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
with continuing inflation and the odds
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
of recession rising and falling by the
 
01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.610 align:start position:0%
of recession rising and falling by the
week

01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the IND tax is our
 
01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
fifth largest revenue source and that
 
01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
its disappearance is likely to threaten
 
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
our state county and Municipal Bond
 
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
ratings as well as to prevent valuable
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
investments in our future
 
01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
and finally if I want to see our state's
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
economy and communities continue to grow
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
despite the economic clouds will I then
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
press the green button to remove this
 
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
dangerous threat from our budget
 
01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
do you recognize ribs in a Sweeney for a

01:21:18.649 --> 01:21:18.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
know that our state's interests in
 
01:21:24.169 --> 01:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
dividends tax is an income tax and Mr
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that by accelerating
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
the phase out of the interest in
 
01:21:30.169 --> 01:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
dividends tax we will be making New
 
01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire income tax free in this
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
biennium in this budget and further Mr
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this

phase out acceleration of the interest
 
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:43.260 align:start position:0%

so that we can pass a budget that all
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
can live with and Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
that we should pass relief for our

senior citizens and granted traders of

million in 2024
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
26.1 million in 25 this amendment would

01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Mr Speaker if I
 
01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
know that the motorium on school
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
building has created a backlog of badly
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
needing building projects and if I know
 
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
that many schools are in dire need of
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
building Aid and we have an opportunity
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
in front of us today to address this
 
01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
batlog which in the long run will
 
01:27:50.209 --> 01:27:50.219 align:start position:0%
benefit the entire State easing this
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
burden across the state across all
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:27:57.169 --> 01:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
when I now press the green button and
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
support this amendment addressing a
 
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
critical need of our schools and school
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
building projects thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
and I represent a while of her
 
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
building Aid was created
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
when the school enrollment was
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
increasing and all the schools needed
 
01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
help in adding classrooms adding schools
 
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
and subsequently
 
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
the enrollment is shrinking
 
01:28:32.689 --> 01:28:32.699 align:start position:0%
so we stopped giving building a we went
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
on a moratorium
 
01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
schools are wasting
 
01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
the assets that they have they have

by selling that empty building so that
 
01:28:58.970 --> 01:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
they could do other repairs and if I

know that the reasons for the moratorium

I'm sorry Amendment 1292 is simple
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
it deletes sections six and seven from
 
01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
hb2 and would therefore continue to

thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
the provision that's being removed by
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment was a request by the
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
community college system and exceeded to
 
01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
by the governor I was actually quite
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
surprised to see it in the budget but
 
01:32:49.970 --> 01:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
what it what it does
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
is it gives the community college system
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
the same retirement plan that the
 
01:33:00.649 --> 01:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
university system has had for I think
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
about 15 years
 
01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
so it's a 403 b plan which is you know
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
similar to an IRA or 401k or something
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
and it and the main feature of it is
 
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
that it's portable
 
01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
so the the plan allows uh people to work
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
for I think it's vesting in three years
 
01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
but if they only work for the system for
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
three years or four years or five years
 
01:33:31.729 --> 01:33:31.739 align:start position:0%
and so on they can take their savings
 
01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
with them the current retirement system
 
01:33:36.649 --> 01:33:36.659 align:start position:0%
requires require requires you to work
 
01:33:39.169 --> 01:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
for 10 years and according to the
 
01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
community college system that they're
 
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
finding that that is unattractive to the
 
01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
Gen Z's and gen x's and gen y's that
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're they are in the process of
 
01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.010 align:start position:0%
they're they are in the process of
hiring

01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
01:33:55.729 --> 01:33:55.739 align:start position:0%
so this this plan again it's the same
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
thing that the university system has had
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
that the community college system would
 
01:34:03.169 --> 01:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
like to join them
 
01:34:06.290 --> 01:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%

that even though the defined benefit was
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%

the contribution
 
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
was greater than the benefit I think we
 
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
should all be able to see
 
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:36.420 align:start position:0%

we did so with the intent
 
01:41:08.209 --> 01:41:08.219 align:start position:0%

of the education trust fund

01:43:19.129 --> 01:43:19.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Mr Seeker if I know
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
that when I helped create
 
01:43:23.930 --> 01:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund it was there
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
specifically to pay for adequacy and
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
used a portion of the general fund
 
01:43:33.410 --> 01:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
to assign to that and if I further know
 
01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
that as
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
subsequently the enrollment has shrunk
 
01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
by about a third meaning that the amount
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
of money that went into that fund
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
was more than it needed to have and it
 
01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
froze those funds so they couldn't be
 
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
used elsewhere
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
and if I further know that my amendment
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
was what restored it to its historical
 
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
use for only adequacy and not to create
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
an education slush fund that people
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
would be seeking places to use elsewhere
 
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button
 
01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:12.060 align:start position:0%

announced that she will be attending the
 
01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
University of South Carolina this fall
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
she is going there in in part at least
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
because it will cost her less to do so
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
as an out-of-state student in South
 
01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
Carolina than it would to go to UNH as
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
an in-state student
 
01:47:39.169 --> 01:47:39.179 align:start position:0%
as we all know too well New Hampshire
 
01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
has the second highest average cost of
 
01:47:45.169 --> 01:47:45.179 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition and fees in the country
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
only Vermont is higher
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
that is because previous legislatures
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
have consistently underfunded our
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
state's University system
 
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
that is also one of the reasons why New
 
01:47:57.890 --> 01:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has one of the highest levels
 
01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
of student debt in the country
 
01:48:03.070 --> 01:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
and it's telling that only
 
01:48:06.290 --> 01:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
48.7 percent of the full-time students
 
01:48:09.290 --> 01:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
attending the university system are in
 
01:48:11.930 --> 01:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
fact New Hampshire residents
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
in addition to imposing a real financial
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
burden on students and families across
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
we are also hurting ourselves
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
when my niece graduates from the
 
01:48:24.590 --> 01:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
University of South Carolina the chances
 
01:48:26.689 --> 01:48:26.699 align:start position:0%
of her returning to New Hampshire and
 
01:48:28.250 --> 01:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
contributing to the fabric of our
 
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
community here will be much less than if
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
she had gone to college here
 
01:48:34.850 --> 01:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
my own daughter went to school in
 
01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
Washington DC
 
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
and guess what that's where she lives
 
01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:40.129 align:start position:0%
and guess what that's where she lives
today

01:48:40.129 --> 01:48:40.139 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:48:41.930 --> 01:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
there is only one state in the country
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
Maine whose population is on average
 
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
older than ours
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
if we continue to make it more expensive
 
01:48:51.169 --> 01:48:51.179 align:start position:0%
for students who want to go to college
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
we will just continue to get older and
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
older as a population which will create
 
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
additional serious economic and
 
01:49:02.450 --> 01:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
budgetary challenges for the
 
01:49:04.609 --> 01:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
legislatures who will be sitting here 5
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
10 and 20 years from now
 
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
I have no doubt that renovating the
 
01:49:10.490 --> 01:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
Whittemore Center will make it a much
 
01:49:13.370 --> 01:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
more appealing venue for alumni and
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
local businesses leaders who live in the
 
01:49:17.090 --> 01:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
Durham area
 
01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
to attend and and take their games to a
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
hockey game or a concert
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that it will generate some
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
additional revenue for unh
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
UNH already has commitments of of over
 
01:49:33.169 --> 01:49:33.179 align:start position:0%
34 million dollars in private donors
 
01:49:35.330 --> 01:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
towards the cost of those Renovations
 
01:49:37.850 --> 01:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that they could raise the
 
01:49:40.669 --> 01:49:40.679 align:start position:0%
remainder of the amount themselves
 
01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'm also very aware that six million
 
01:49:46.129 --> 01:49:46.139 align:start position:0%
dollars will not fix the imbalance in
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
tuition costs that now exists we should
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
do more much more
 
01:49:53.810 --> 01:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
given the other budget challenges we are
 
01:49:55.970 --> 01:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
trying to address today that is a
 
01:49:58.129 --> 01:49:58.139 align:start position:0%
discussion for another day
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
but until we have that discussion I
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
believe we need to do whatever we can to
 
01:50:05.689 --> 01:50:05.699 align:start position:0%
make our University system more
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
affordable for more of our own students
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
and be willing to defer other nice to
 
01:50:12.410 --> 01:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
have projects
 
01:50:14.330 --> 01:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
this amendment will not increase the
 
01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:15.169 align:start position:0%
this amendment will not increase the
budget

01:50:15.169 --> 01:50:15.179 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:50:17.330 --> 01:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
nor does it take away any money
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
allocated to the university system
 
01:50:22.370 --> 01:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
what this amendment will do is move six
 
01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars which is currently
 
01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
allocated allocated specifically for
 
01:50:28.970 --> 01:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
renovating expanding the Whittemore
 
01:50:31.970 --> 01:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
Center during fy24 and move three
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars into the state's general
 
01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
allocation of funds for fy24 and fy25
 
01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
those funds will be utilized to reduce
 
01:50:44.810 --> 01:50:44.820 align:start position:0%
ins in States in-state tuition and their
 
01:50:46.609 --> 01:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
specific language in the amendment that
 
01:50:49.490 --> 01:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
that says that which currently ranges
 
01:50:51.770 --> 01:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
from between eleven thousand five
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifteen thousand five
 
01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:53.810 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifteen thousand five
hundred

01:50:53.810 --> 01:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're approx approximately 10 700
 
01:51:00.050 --> 01:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
full-time in-state students enrolled at
 
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
UNH Keene State and Plymouth State and
 
01:51:04.970 --> 01:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
the additional three million dollars
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment will make will allocate
 
01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
to the system will result in annual
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
Savings of between 230 and 310 dollars
 
01:51:17.930 --> 01:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
or 920 or 1240 over four years to
 
01:51:20.209 --> 01:51:20.219 align:start position:0%
students and families across New
 
01:51:20.219 --> 01:51:21.350 align:start position:0%
students and families across New
Hampshire

01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
it's not enough but it's a start and it
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
represents real tangible savings for New
 
01:51:29.570 --> 01:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families that we can deliver
 
01:51:33.410 --> 01:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
today without increasing the budget
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
I hope you will join me in supporting
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
these families by voting in favor of
 
01:51:40.729 --> 01:51:40.739 align:start position:0%
this amendment and Mr Speaker I request

thank you Mr Speaker and honorable
Representatives

01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
I want to Echo uh the thoughts from my
 
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
friend from Hampton
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
that we need to lower the cost of
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition for the University
 
01:52:07.370 --> 01:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire
 
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
students are struggling and are paying
 
01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
more to go to schools that are tax
 
01:52:14.330 --> 01:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
dollars fund than they are to go to
 
01:52:17.450 --> 01:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
this is an opera you give students a
 
01:52:22.370 --> 01:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
small break because UNH has already
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
received funding from private donors to
 
01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
upgrade the Whittemore Center
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
while these improvements are nice and
 
01:52:31.010 --> 01:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
would include upgraded HVAC systems
 
01:52:33.290 --> 01:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
audio improvements and modifications for
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
rink seating
 
01:52:38.510 --> 01:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
these upgrades are not necessarily being
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
benefited by the students the students
 
01:52:45.850 --> 01:52:45.860 align:start position:0%
are still paying more and are struggling
 
01:52:49.010 --> 01:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
and the state has a pattern of using
 
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
student tuition to offset the costs
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
that the university usually takes on
 
01:52:59.209 --> 01:52:59.219 align:start position:0%
I'm asking all of you to support this
 
01:53:02.330 --> 01:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
amendment as a way to lower the cost of
 
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
tuition for students in something that
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
is already allocated in our budget
 
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:16.729 --> 01:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker

my colleague from Rock Rockingham
 
01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:21.109 align:start position:0%
my colleague from Rock Rockingham

01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
29
 
01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
has kind of missed the point
 
01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:27.060 align:start position:0%
the point of this six million dollars
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
which came to us and financed and the
 
01:53:32.649 --> 01:53:32.659 align:start position:0%
governor's not a budget is
 
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
recommendation input okay on the
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
governor's input
 
01:53:39.649 --> 01:53:39.659 align:start position:0%
the the chancellor of the University sat
 
01:53:43.129 --> 01:53:43.139 align:start position:0%
before us and explained the winamore
 
01:53:43.139 --> 01:53:44.470 align:start position:0%
before us and explained the winamore
center

01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
rebuild is a 30 million dollar project
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
what they're looking for is for the
 
01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
state to kick in something to show that
 
01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
we support the University
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's the point it's not about tuition
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's about do we support UNH are we
 
01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
proud of what we've done and if you've
 
01:54:04.729 --> 01:54:04.739 align:start position:0%
gone to the Whittemore Center and
 
01:54:07.490 --> 01:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
watched athletes warm up in the Halls
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know we haven't provided the best
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
environment for our athletes
 
01:54:14.750 --> 01:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
this upgrade will also allow the center
 
01:54:16.930 --> 01:54:16.940 align:start position:0%
to be used for other Gatherings
 
01:54:20.209 --> 01:54:20.219 align:start position:0%
entertainment venue and I I think that's
 
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
the point of this six million dollars
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
originally it came in at eight million
 
01:54:28.609 --> 01:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
dollars but the chancellor agreed six
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars they can get the
 
01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
matching funds
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
if they don't get the six million
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
dollars the project dies
 
01:54:39.850 --> 01:54:39.860 align:start position:0%
the the contributors
 
01:54:43.129 --> 01:54:43.139 align:start position:0%
alumni that are pledging to this project
 
01:54:47.689 --> 01:54:47.699 align:start position:0%
it depends on us kicking in six million
 
01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
dollars so if you want to kill the
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
project vote for this amendment
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:57:10.609 --> 01:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
if I know that New Hampshire has the
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
second highest cost of in-state tuition
 
01:57:15.470 --> 01:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
and fees in the country
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
and that New Hampshire has one of the
 
01:57:19.250 --> 01:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
highest levels of student debt in the

country
 
01:57:22.970 --> 01:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
and that as a result only 48 percent of
 
01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:25.500 align:start position:0%

01:57:27.890 --> 01:57:27.900 align:start position:0%

proud of and has consistently
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
demonstrated its support of unh over the
 
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
years and that now is the time to show
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
our support for these in-state students
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%

and if I know that by voting in favor of
 
01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
this amendment I will reduce the cost of
 
01:57:52.209 --> 01:57:52.219 align:start position:0%
tuition for New Hampshire students

01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:03.719 align:start position:0%
I know that I can provide these students
 
01:58:06.649 --> 01:58:06.659 align:start position:0%
and their families these savings without

02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1299 age is a very simple
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that removes the authorization
 
02:01:14.570 --> 02:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
of an appropriation for the northern
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
border Alliance program
 
02:01:19.490 --> 02:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
we've made it clear in this body that we
 
02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
do not support using State funds to
 
02:01:24.290 --> 02:01:24.300 align:start position:0%
enforce Federal Regulations but this
 
02:01:26.330 --> 02:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
section of hb2 would not only use
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money to do exactly that but
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
would also increase the authority of
 
02:01:33.169 --> 02:01:33.179 align:start position:0%
state and local police far beyond what
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
our communities are comfortable with
 
02:01:36.649 --> 02:01:36.659 align:start position:0%
we've made it clear in New Hampshire
 
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
that we are Harbor of safety for those
 
02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
seeking freedom and liberty whether they
 
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
come from out of state or out of the
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
country in fact my own immigrant family
 
02:01:48.410 --> 02:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
came here when I was five years old to
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
raise their family and we've been here
 
02:01:51.169 --> 02:01:51.179 align:start position:0%
ever since
 
02:01:52.570 --> 02:01:52.580 align:start position:0%
a program
 
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
that allows our taxpayer money to pay
 
02:01:57.290 --> 02:01:57.300 align:start position:0%
police to roam unchecked on Northern
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
properties stopping and racial profiling
 
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
whomever they want is enough to keep
 
02:02:03.709 --> 02:02:03.719 align:start position:0%
families like mine from feeling welcome
 
02:02:05.209 --> 02:02:05.219 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
this program is built on the wild
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
assumption that Northern New Hampshire
 
02:02:10.729 --> 02:02:10.739 align:start position:0%
has an extreme problem with illegal
 
02:02:13.729 --> 02:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
border crossings yet despite informal
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
and formal requests neither the governor
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
nor any state agency including the
 
02:02:21.709 --> 02:02:21.719 align:start position:0%
department of safety has provided any
 
02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
data on authorized on unauthorized
 
02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
border entries into New Hampshire or of
 
02:02:30.050 --> 02:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
apprehensions of Border crosses crossers
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire to support these
 
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
supposed concerns I'm not sure why we
 
02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:36.659 align:start position:0%
would Institute such an unregulated
 
02:02:39.169 --> 02:02:39.179 align:start position:0%
program without any data or studies to
 
02:02:40.669 --> 02:02:40.679 align:start position:0%
indicate it's needed
 
02:02:43.370 --> 02:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
with an implementation date of June 30th
 
02:02:46.129 --> 02:02:46.139 align:start position:0%
2023 this program is simply too
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
undefined and too rushed to pass through
 
02:02:51.290 --> 02:02:51.300 align:start position:0%
this budget taxpayer money for police
 
02:02:52.970 --> 02:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
should directly assist in meeting
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
Community needs and priorities not take
 
02:02:57.770 --> 02:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
away from those commitments to instead
 
02:03:00.250 --> 02:03:00.260 align:start position:0%
focus on enforcing Federal Regulations
 
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
this program is a massive intrusion on
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
local control and contravenes New

our local officials do not do the
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
bidding of the federal government and if
 
02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
you agree with me I ask you to please
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
vote green on the ought to pass motion

02:03:30.589 --> 02:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
it would be disingenuous if I got up
 
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
this morning and talked about spending
 
02:03:37.550 --> 02:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
when there was an opportunity to cut
 
02:03:39.770 --> 02:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
spending that is a task of the federal
 
02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:41.990 align:start position:0%

while it's not much it's 1.4 million
 
02:03:47.810 --> 02:03:47.820 align:start position:0%
it does in fact reduce the spending this

25 miles police officers to have
 
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest capabilities

of a more
 
02:04:16.490 --> 02:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional power that we could
 
02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
give to state government than allowing
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%

simplest thing you're going to see all
 
02:09:28.970 --> 02:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
day inside of uh hb2 there was a uh an
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
item that uh identified a Civics
 
02:09:36.649 --> 02:09:36.659 align:start position:0%
commission that would help facilitate
 
02:09:40.010 --> 02:09:40.020 align:start position:0%

02:09:43.609 --> 02:09:43.619 align:start position:0%
curriculum for the our school system and

one of the things one of the vital
 
02:09:51.530 --> 02:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
groups that got left out was the New

Historical Society back I don't I don't
 
02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
think this is controversial if if no one
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
from the other side is going to speak
 
02:10:19.250 --> 02:10:19.260 align:start position:0%

in the department and we're currently
 
02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
funding 32 positions and it reduces it
 
02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
to 29. and I would just ask that you
 
02:11:50.689 --> 02:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:50.699 --> 02:11:51.950 align:start position:0%

attorneys available to them to do their

caseload and if I believed that a
 
02:14:00.530 --> 02:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
reduction of 3 to 29 might harm their
 
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
ability to provide the services to the

if it's happened to you you get it it's
 
02:16:17.149 --> 02:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
really disconcerting to be speaking at
 
02:16:19.069 --> 02:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
the well and somebody just comes walking
 
02:16:21.169 --> 02:16:21.179 align:start position:0%
down right at your face
 
02:16:22.970 --> 02:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
there's an aisle on the side that you
 
02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
can use so let's try to get this back
 
02:16:34.730 --> 02:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:34.740 --> 02:16:44.990 align:start position:0%
 
12.95

02:16:44.990 --> 02:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:47.570 --> 02:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
the bill remains on second reading and
 
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
further open a further Amendment
 
02:16:52.969 --> 02:16:52.979 align:start position:0%
representative Prout office floor
 
02:16:55.310 --> 02:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1295 and is recognized to
 
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this amendment would delete
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
section 135 of house bill 2.
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
current law limits the auxiliary State
 
02:17:16.129 --> 02:17:16.139 align:start position:0%
Police to no more than 16 members
 
02:17:19.009 --> 02:17:19.019 align:start position:0%
this limit was added back in 2013 in
 
02:17:22.610 --> 02:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 165 as a trade-off when the
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
number of days per year they could serve
 
02:17:26.929 --> 02:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
on active duty was removed
 
02:17:29.870 --> 02:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
section 135 removes the 16-member limit
 
02:17:32.990 --> 02:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
with no trade-off
 
02:17:34.730 --> 02:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
membership of the auxiliary State Police
 
02:17:37.370 --> 02:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
has few limitations the person must be a
 
02:17:39.410 --> 02:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizen 20 year 21 years
 
02:17:42.290 --> 02:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
old and have no felony convictions there
 
02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
are uniforms and equipment are paid for
 
02:17:44.929 --> 02:17:44.939 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
they're compensated at rates set by the
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
director when on duty
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
the removal of this limitation would
 
02:17:53.570 --> 02:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
allow the state police to grow to
 
02:17:55.310 --> 02:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
essentially any size
 
02:17:57.290 --> 02:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
the only real limitation would be funds
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
to pay for them
 
02:18:00.889 --> 02:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
with opportunities to use federal funds
 
02:18:02.889 --> 02:18:02.899 align:start position:0%
such as to continue the failed drug war
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
augment border patrol or any other task
 
02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
force funded by whatever Administration
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
happens to be in power at the time
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
if you do not want to see the New
 
02:18:15.410 --> 02:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police state growing excuse me
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
I mean the New Hampshire State Police
 
02:18:18.370 --> 02:18:18.380 align:start position:0%
grow unchecked
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
by any controls of this legislature then
 
02:18:23.330 --> 02:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
please press the green button to pass
 
02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559 align:start position:0%

leave the 16-member limitation in place
 
02:18:34.370 --> 02:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:35.929 --> 02:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to adopt
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment one two nine five-h
 
02:18:41.389 --> 02:18:41.399 align:start position:0%

02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you if I know that Amendment 1295
 
02:19:42.589 --> 02:19:42.599 align:start position:0%
presents a simple common sense and
 
02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
bipartisan counter to a concerning
 
02:19:46.969 --> 02:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
Loosely defined and unnecessary
 
02:19:49.130 --> 02:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
expansion of police power
 
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the people of New
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire deserve an appropriately
 
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
structured and responsive use of state
 
02:19:57.889 --> 02:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
power including in the organization of
 
02:19:59.570 --> 02:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
our police to address emergency
 
02:20:02.330 --> 02:20:02.340 align:start position:0%

02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:07.080 align:start position:0%

02:20:17.690 --> 02:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
if I know that the auxiliary State
 
02:20:20.929 --> 02:20:20.939 align:start position:0%
Police are seldom used and then most of
 
02:20:22.670 --> 02:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
them if I further know that most of them
 
02:20:25.010 --> 02:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
are retired police and have experience
 
02:20:27.290 --> 02:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
in what they're doing and if I further
 
02:20:31.370 --> 02:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
know that if it occasion arises that the
 
02:20:34.310 --> 02:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
state police need more people where else
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
can they get them from I would vote red
 
02:20:40.670 --> 02:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
to allow them this slight emergency use
 
02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:44.520 align:start position:0%

my colleague from Auburn this is going
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
to be relatively fast fast and simple
 
02:22:33.650 --> 02:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
what my Amendment does is uh has us
 
02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
codify a vote we took less
 
02:22:39.070 --> 02:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
session that we met in relation to
 
02:22:42.770 --> 02:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming simply the expansion
 
02:22:45.950 --> 02:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
of the one game that the legislature
 
02:22:48.590 --> 02:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
passed into law last biennium the
 
02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing allowing for ample
 
02:22:55.490 --> 02:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
time to review revenue for both the
 
02:22:58.490 --> 02:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
state and the Charities I won't get into
 
02:23:00.349 --> 02:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
the long discussion about the five years
 
02:23:02.870 --> 02:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
being ample time it may take longer but
 
02:23:04.370 --> 02:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
at least it gives them the five years
 
02:23:06.530 --> 02:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I look forward to your support on
 
02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:23:47.330 --> 02:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this amendment would add what
 
02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
was House Bill 624 to the end of the
 
02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:52.250 align:start position:0%
was House Bill 624 to the end of the
budget

02:23:52.250 --> 02:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
this Bill had made it so that local
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
police when they learn of a border
 
02:23:59.870 --> 02:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
patrol checkpoint like the ones that
 
02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
have been happening at I-93
 
02:24:04.730 --> 02:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
to require them to announce it to the
 
02:24:04.740 --> 02:24:05.630 align:start position:0%

02:24:05.630 --> 02:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:24:07.730 --> 02:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
similar to how we require DUI
 
02:24:09.230 --> 02:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
checkpoints run by local police to be
 
02:24:12.650 --> 02:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:15.230 --> 02:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
this is because of all the terrible
 
02:24:17.090 --> 02:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
traffic scenarios when they do this in
 
02:24:19.910 --> 02:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
I-93 just south of the notch keeping
 
02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
people stuck on the highway for hours
 
02:24:24.410 --> 02:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
hurting tourism the area
 
02:24:28.370 --> 02:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
and also acting as a detainment on
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:35.150 --> 02:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
if you voted for House Bill 624 several
 
02:24:37.309 --> 02:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
weeks ago when we passed it I hope you
 
02:24:38.929 --> 02:24:38.939 align:start position:0%
will also press the green button and
 
02:24:40.370 --> 02:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
vote for this as well
 
02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:46.670 --> 02:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to adopt
 
02:24:49.610 --> 02:24:49.620 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:25:47.690 --> 02:25:47.700 align:start position:0%

02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
and visitors value their right to move
 
02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:51.840 align:start position:0%

02:28:25.550 --> 02:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:28:27.889 --> 02:28:27.899 align:start position:0%
this is a short Amendment does two
 
02:28:31.309 --> 02:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
things the first is it corrects a small
 
02:28:34.670 --> 02:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
clerical issue on regarding eligibility
 
02:28:36.770 --> 02:28:36.780 align:start position:0%
the program has had a very consistent
 
02:28:40.010 --> 02:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirement in drafting
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
the finance Amendment there was a small
 
02:28:43.730 --> 02:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
change it made it through the system
 
02:28:46.370 --> 02:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
this corrects the eligibility standard
 
02:28:49.210 --> 02:28:49.220 align:start position:0%
secondly it moves the eligibility
 
02:28:52.610 --> 02:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
regarding finances from the current 350
 
02:28:54.290 --> 02:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
percent that the house has adopted to
 
02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:56.630 align:start position:0%
percent that the house has adopted to
500

02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
500
 
02:28:58.550 --> 02:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
just to put some numbers so that we all
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
understand in household dollars
 
02:29:03.590 --> 02:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
a family of four the federal poverty
 
02:29:05.870 --> 02:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
level is approximately thirty thousand
 
02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:08.450 align:start position:0%
level is approximately thirty thousand
dollars

02:29:08.450 --> 02:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:10.010 --> 02:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
three hundred percent of that which is
 
02:29:12.650 --> 02:29:12.660 align:start position:0%
the current law is ninety thousand
 
02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
dollars for a family of four it's hard
 
02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
to imagine with a family of four how to
 
02:29:19.849 --> 02:29:19.859 align:start position:0%
pay bills pay a mortgage
 
02:29:21.790 --> 02:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
and send children to a private school
 
02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
with tuition somewhere between four and
 
02:29:28.969 --> 02:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment will allow that to go up
 
02:29:33.469 --> 02:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
to something that would be more
 
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable and allow additional people
 
02:29:39.889 --> 02:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:42.290 --> 02:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
personally in the last 10 years I've
 
02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
lived at the federal poverty level my
 
02:29:46.730 --> 02:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
household income dropped significantly
 
02:29:49.610 --> 02:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
and while I've never taken money from
 
02:29:51.410 --> 02:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
the state to fund our children's
 
02:29:51.420 --> 02:29:53.210 align:start position:0%
the state to fund our children's
education

02:29:53.210 --> 02:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:29:55.370 --> 02:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
I can understand why there are families
 
02:29:57.770 --> 02:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
who believe that this is necessary who
 
02:29:59.389 --> 02:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
for the reasons of anything from
 
02:30:01.610 --> 02:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
bullying to not getting the education
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
they need to feeling like they want to
 
02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
they want something different whether
 
02:30:11.330 --> 02:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
it's the teaching style the curriculum
 
02:30:13.370 --> 02:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
they just want something different than
 
02:30:15.889 --> 02:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
the than the solution proposed by the
 
02:30:15.899 --> 02:30:17.090 align:start position:0%
the than the solution proposed by the
state

02:30:17.090 --> 02:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:30:18.650 --> 02:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you would support this
 
02:30:22.190 --> 02:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment and press green I'll ask
 
02:30:25.969 --> 02:30:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:27.830 --> 02:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie is recognized
 
02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
and a A late good morning to everybody
 
02:30:48.290 --> 02:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
I raised to oppose this amendment uh
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
originally because of the concern about
 
02:30:52.429 --> 02:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
the increase
 
02:30:56.690 --> 02:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
uh in in a budget but really you have to
 
02:30:59.870 --> 02:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
go looking more at the amendment I was
 
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
concerned that the 500 percent
 
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh going from 350 from to 500 percent of
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
Eligibility ability and this issue the
 
02:31:14.270 --> 02:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account has been
 
02:31:17.690 --> 02:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
discussed over and over uh if my memory
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
is right and at my age it might I might
 
02:31:22.849 --> 02:31:22.859 align:start position:0%
have some concern about that but I think
 
02:31:27.290 --> 02:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
that the issue of going from 300 to 350
 
02:31:32.030 --> 02:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh out to 500 was better very recently
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
so I was I'm concerned that the 500
 
02:31:39.010 --> 02:31:39.020 align:start position:0%
percent would come up again to make more
 
02:31:42.969 --> 02:31:42.979 align:start position:0%
people eligible for the freedom
 
02:31:47.650 --> 02:31:47.660 align:start position:0%
account so I'm more concerned ask you to
 
02:31:51.070 --> 02:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
vote against and vote red
 
02:31:54.590 --> 02:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
mainly because this is an issue that has
 
02:31:56.750 --> 02:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
embedded over and over again it has been
 
02:32:00.410 --> 02:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
looked at by the uh the finance
 
02:32:04.090 --> 02:32:04.100 align:start position:0%
committee finance committee has
 
02:32:06.429 --> 02:32:06.439 align:start position:0%
put information
 
02:32:10.370 --> 02:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
and talked about that account in the
 
02:32:12.770 --> 02:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
budget in the original budget and I
 
02:32:16.670 --> 02:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
think it's prudent for us to put this in
 
02:32:18.770 --> 02:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
the back burner and if we want to talk
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
about increasing those items we should
 
02:32:24.530 --> 02:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
do it through the regular process going
 
02:32:26.809 --> 02:32:26.819 align:start position:0%
letting it get vetted against if
 
02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
necessary at the community level and
 
02:32:34.610 --> 02:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
come back to the house if in fact it is
 
02:32:36.170 --> 02:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
something that we need
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:43.130 --> 02:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
ah it's just slow representative we're

Mr Speaker we already heard earlier an
 
02:35:13.790 --> 02:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
amendment about the Whitmore Center
 
02:35:16.969 --> 02:35:16.979 align:start position:0%
why spending State funds to help upgrade
 
02:35:16.979 --> 02:35:17.690 align:start position:0%
why spending State funds to help upgrade
it

02:35:17.690 --> 02:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:35:20.210 --> 02:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
was unnecessary and not a wise use of
 
02:35:22.429 --> 02:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
our tax dollars
 
02:35:24.290 --> 02:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
how this amendment differs from the
 
02:35:26.510 --> 02:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
earlier one is what to do with those
 
02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
funds once that section is deleted
 
02:35:32.809 --> 02:35:32.819 align:start position:0%
this amendment will just reduce State
 
02:35:36.290 --> 02:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
spending and send that money back to the
 
02:35:38.330 --> 02:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund and eventually the
 
02:35:38.340 --> 02:35:39.530 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund and eventually the
taxpayers

through other sources of funds whether

dollars of State funding forward
 
02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
and I know that passing this amendment
 
02:37:11.090 --> 02:37:11.100 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
02:41:35.990 --> 02:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
know that the this amendment would
 
02:41:38.570 --> 02:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
simply not add another staff member to
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
the office of the consumer Advocate who
 
02:41:43.250 --> 02:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
already has open positions if I know
 
02:41:45.349 --> 02:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
that the budget that we were proposing
 
02:41:48.110 --> 02:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
has 75 thousand dollars from those open
 
02:41:49.670 --> 02:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
positions that could be used to hire

02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
and we have a full-time employee of
 
02:42:06.889 --> 02:42:06.899 align:start position:0%
Department of energy who does that and I
 
02:42:08.270 --> 02:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
know that the Office of Consumer
 
02:42:11.210 --> 02:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
Advocate is already doing a good job at
 
02:42:13.849 --> 02:42:13.859 align:start position:0%
that and I know authorizing another
 
02:42:16.130 --> 02:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
position that they can't fill will
 
02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
accomplish nothing and I know this
 
02:42:19.910 --> 02:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
amendment would save over a hundred
 
02:42:22.130 --> 02:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year would I please
 
02:42:26.330 --> 02:42:26.340 align:start position:0%

02:42:58.969 --> 02:42:58.979 align:start position:0%
which is a requirement now in the rsas
 
02:43:01.550 --> 02:43:01.560 align:start position:0%

02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:35.330 --> 02:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to read it
 
02:44:37.849 --> 02:44:37.859 align:start position:0%
don't rest assured
 
02:44:42.950 --> 02:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
so what is amendment 1333h
 
02:44:44.570 --> 02:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
in summary
 
02:44:46.550 --> 02:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's the committee Finance or the
 
02:44:49.250 --> 02:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
finance committee Amendment
 
02:44:52.849 --> 02:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
with a few small changes
 
02:44:55.130 --> 02:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
well no I I do mean that in small
 
02:44:55.140 --> 02:44:56.210 align:start position:0%
well no I I do mean that in small
changes

02:44:56.210 --> 02:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:44:58.849 --> 02:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
but structurally for for a tactical
 
02:45:01.969 --> 02:45:01.979 align:start position:0%
reason I changed section one which
 
02:45:03.710 --> 02:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
forced the renumbering of the finance
 
02:45:05.090 --> 02:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment all the way through
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
which changed
 
02:45:08.990 --> 02:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
and if you do that that would have
 
02:45:10.490 --> 02:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
nullified and someone else pointed it
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
out this morning would have nullified
 
02:45:13.010 --> 02:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
all the other amendments on the floor
 
02:45:14.330 --> 02:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
today that we could have even talked
 
02:45:14.340 --> 02:45:15.050 align:start position:0%
today that we could have even talked
about

02:45:15.050 --> 02:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:45:18.290 --> 02:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
so it would have given us a simple
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
solution to a one vote
 
02:45:23.090 --> 02:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
on the budget
 
02:45:24.650 --> 02:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
you may or may not agree with that
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
choice but at least it would have
 
02:45:27.770 --> 02:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
shortened our day
 
02:45:30.410 --> 02:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
so it is the finance committee Amendment
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
as adopted by this house it does not
 
02:45:37.130 --> 02:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment proposed by the members
 
02:45:42.050 --> 02:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
from Manchester and Auburn
 
02:45:45.110 --> 02:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
it does contain the change for the efes
 
02:45:47.690 --> 02:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
that we just talked about
 
02:45:50.570 --> 02:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
it also does something important which
 
02:45:52.730 --> 02:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
is what I talked about this morning it
 
02:45:55.849 --> 02:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
keeps our spending and our revenues on
 
02:45:55.859 --> 02:45:57.710 align:start position:0%
keeps our spending and our revenues on
parity

02:45:57.710 --> 02:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
parity
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
it makes cuts it level funds the UNH
 
02:46:00.479 --> 02:46:01.969 align:start position:0%
it makes cuts it level funds the UNH
system

02:46:01.969 --> 02:46:01.979 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:46:04.490 --> 02:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
it gets rid of the Whitmore rank
 
02:46:06.410 --> 02:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
or whatever the funding for the the
 
02:46:09.650 --> 02:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
Whitmore Renovations it level funds the
 
02:46:12.290 --> 02:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
02:46:15.050 --> 02:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
it provides 85 percent of the requested
 
02:46:16.730 --> 02:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
employee raise for the state employees
 
02:46:19.730 --> 02:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
so instead of 10 raise they get an eight
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:27.530 --> 02:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
with these cuts to the budget
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
we are now equal to the to our Revenue
 
02:46:33.410 --> 02:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
stream and for those that want to manage
 
02:46:35.929 --> 02:46:35.939 align:start position:0%
Finance is you have to link the two you
 
02:46:38.090 --> 02:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
can't just pretend that there's
 
02:46:40.370 --> 02:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
additional revenues coming in or what
 
02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the past which is we're
 
02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
taking the excess revenues from last
 
02:46:46.429 --> 02:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
year and spending them to prop up this
 
02:46:46.439 --> 02:46:47.750 align:start position:0%
year and spending them to prop up this
budget

02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:46:49.250 --> 02:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you would support it
 
02:46:53.690 --> 02:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:55.309 --> 02:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to adopt

and if I further know that this is just
 
02:48:43.370 --> 02:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
too much
 
02:48:46.610 --> 02:48:46.620 align:start position:0%

02:54:44.389 --> 02:54:44.399 align:start position:0%

02:54:51.130 --> 02:54:51.140 align:start position:0%
160 very loud folks in the affirmative
 
02:55:30.110 --> 02:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:34.370 --> 02:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
the motion before us now is on hb2 on a
 
02:55:38.090 --> 02:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:48.410 --> 02:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:50.269 --> 02:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
I think this is my last time up here
 
02:55:52.550 --> 02:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
today at least I hope
 
02:55:54.290 --> 02:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
you've heard the arguments against the
 
02:55:56.510 --> 02:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
budget multiple times you've heard that
 
02:55:57.950 --> 02:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
this spends too much
 
02:56:01.550 --> 02:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
spends more than we take in in Revenue
 
02:56:04.910 --> 02:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
we just added between various amendments
 
02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
something close to another 80 million
 
02:56:10.910 --> 02:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:14.330 --> 02:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
when you put together a plan
 
02:56:16.610 --> 02:56:16.620 align:start position:0%
that doesn't take into account the
 
02:56:18.410 --> 02:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
declining revenues we're seeing out of
 
02:56:20.690 --> 02:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
02:56:23.690 --> 02:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
and spends all that we take in plus
 
02:56:25.910 --> 02:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
almost another 300 million dollars in
 
02:56:29.650 --> 02:56:29.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:32.090 --> 02:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
approximately 18 percent
 
02:56:35.269 --> 02:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
more than less budget
 
02:56:37.490 --> 02:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
probably closer to 19 now I'd have to do
 
02:56:40.490 --> 02:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:42.290 --> 02:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
it's a hard thing to go back and defend
 
02:56:46.790 --> 02:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:49.550 --> 02:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
that that was a good policy
 
02:56:50.929 --> 02:56:50.939 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you would post the auto
 
02:56:53.389 --> 02:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
pass motion so that we can potentially
 
02:56:56.990 --> 02:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
figure out another solution thank you
 
02:57:05.570 --> 02:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:07.309 --> 02:57:07.319 align:start position:0%

it's been a long morning

02:57:11.990 --> 02:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:57:14.510 --> 02:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of rearranging of what
 
02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
was passed but I think we can make it
 
02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:19.849 align:start position:0%
was passed but I think we can make it
work

02:57:19.849 --> 02:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:57:23.570 --> 02:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
it's been as I said a bipartisan budget
 
02:57:25.370 --> 02:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
there's something in there for all of us
 
02:57:28.309 --> 02:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to be able to defend
 
02:57:31.309 --> 02:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
it when it goes to the Senate we have to
 
02:57:34.490 --> 02:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
pass it otherwise we don't have anything
 
02:57:36.230 --> 02:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
to argue with
 
02:57:39.410 --> 02:57:39.420 align:start position:0%

02:57:45.590 --> 02:57:45.600 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:02:02.389 --> 03:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
Horizon opposition to the motion on the
 
03:02:04.070 --> 03:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
floor before you today
 
03:02:06.889 --> 03:02:06.899 align:start position:0%
House Bill 74 was a relatively simple
 
03:02:09.110 --> 03:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
bill which passed this house previously
 
03:02:11.210 --> 03:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
from the policy committee
 
03:02:13.969 --> 03:02:13.979 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it only impacts
 
03:02:17.809 --> 03:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
companies that have 15 or more employees
 
03:02:20.990 --> 03:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
it requires that they have a policy
 
03:02:25.550 --> 03:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
that they keep track of your earned time
 
03:02:29.750 --> 03:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:31.790 --> 03:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't really cost the state
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
anything at all so you know wondering
 
03:02:35.450 --> 03:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
what was the fiscal impact of this well
 
03:02:37.070 --> 03:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
they said it was 2.4 million dollars so
 
03:02:39.469 --> 03:02:39.479 align:start position:0%
that's if we laid off all of the state
 
03:02:41.690 --> 03:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
employees tomorrow
 
03:02:44.330 --> 03:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
it would affect us to that point
 
03:02:46.370 --> 03:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
it really is an impact here as far as
 
03:02:48.710 --> 03:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
the budget is concerned
 
03:02:50.090 --> 03:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
let me just tell you a little story
 
03:02:50.100 --> 03:02:51.650 align:start position:0%
let me just tell you a little story
because

03:02:51.650 --> 03:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:02:53.090 --> 03:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear that this doesn't
 
03:02:55.849 --> 03:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
affect a lot of people
 
03:02:58.550 --> 03:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
what it does do is that if someone is to
 
03:03:00.110 --> 03:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
be laid off
 
03:03:04.250 --> 03:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
let's just say that when covet hit
 
03:03:06.230 --> 03:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
your company told you that well we're
 
03:03:07.490 --> 03:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
going to have a layoff soon here we
 
03:03:08.929 --> 03:03:08.939 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going on
 
03:03:10.309 --> 03:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
and one day you get a call you got to
 
03:03:12.050 --> 03:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
show up to work early
 
03:03:15.710 --> 03:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
and the public Human Services human
 
03:03:18.769 --> 03:03:18.779 align:start position:0%
the Personnel person is there to tell
 
03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
you that
 
03:03:21.650 --> 03:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
they're going to shut down the business
 
03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
at midnight that night
 
03:03:25.070 --> 03:03:25.080 align:start position:0%

03:03:26.750 --> 03:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
well what about my health insurance do I
 
03:03:28.429 --> 03:03:28.439 align:start position:0%

03:03:30.830 --> 03:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
they say no you don't it ends at
 
03:03:30.840 --> 03:03:32.090 align:start position:0%
they say no you don't it ends at
midnight

03:03:32.090 --> 03:03:32.100 align:start position:0%
midnight
 
03:03:37.910 --> 03:03:37.920 align:start position:0%

but when a company has a policy
 
03:04:35.510 --> 03:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
and anybody over 15 hour 15 people
 
03:04:37.849 --> 03:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
employed were required you know if they
 
03:04:39.290 --> 03:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
have a policy they'll be required to
 
03:04:41.150 --> 03:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
tell you about it they'll be required to
 
03:04:42.530 --> 03:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
keep track of those hours you'll know
 
03:04:44.510 --> 03:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
how many hours you were when they give
 
03:04:46.250 --> 03:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
you that Paula in that policy they give
 
03:04:47.929 --> 03:04:47.939 align:start position:0%
you earns time sit time and vacation
 
03:04:50.330 --> 03:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
time that's earned time
 
03:04:53.090 --> 03:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
you worked for that time
 
03:04:56.330 --> 03:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
and if it only affects one employee
 
03:04:58.790 --> 03:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's a traumatic experience for that one
 
03:05:01.790 --> 03:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
employee when they're told there's no
 
03:05:03.950 --> 03:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
work tomorrow pick up your check on
 
03:05:03.960 --> 03:05:06.110 align:start position:0%
work tomorrow pick up your check on
Friday

03:05:06.110 --> 03:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
03:05:09.349 --> 03:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
you're more concerned about your family
 
03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
your home your life
 
03:05:14.990 --> 03:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
than you are on whether you got paid
 
03:05:19.010 --> 03:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:22.010 --> 03:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
if it affects one employee
 
03:05:25.790 --> 03:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:29.210 --> 03:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
because if we don't pass this bill
 
03:05:31.130 --> 03:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
we are letting down
 
03:05:35.210 --> 03:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
the person who works hard every day
 
03:05:37.730 --> 03:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
gets earned vacation time
 
03:05:39.469 --> 03:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
and basically is cheated out of that
 
03:05:41.450 --> 03:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
vacation time
 
03:05:43.610 --> 03:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
that story was a true story it was my
 
03:05:43.620 --> 03:05:45.170 align:start position:0%
that story was a true story it was my
story

03:05:45.170 --> 03:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
story
 
03:05:47.210 --> 03:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you that you vote no on this
 
03:05:48.650 --> 03:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
motion so another motion may be made
 
03:05:52.130 --> 03:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:53.570 --> 03:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
do you recognized representative
 
03:05:58.010 --> 03:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:00.410 --> 03:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:06:02.870 --> 03:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is a classic example of a
 
03:06:05.750 --> 03:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
solution looking for a problem
 
03:06:07.849 --> 03:06:07.859 align:start position:0%
the majority of the finance committee in
 
03:06:09.650 --> 03:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan vote
 
03:06:11.929 --> 03:06:11.939 align:start position:0%
deemed this bill to be inexperienced
 
03:06:15.230 --> 03:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
legislate during the testimony for this
 
03:06:17.630 --> 03:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
bill it became clear that this issue
 
03:06:20.389 --> 03:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
affects only a tiny tiny fraction of the
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Workforce
 
03:06:24.769 --> 03:06:24.779 align:start position:0%
the data presenters show at a very low
 
03:06:26.990 --> 03:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
number of complaints on this issue
 
03:06:30.349 --> 03:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
that implies that the vast majority of
 
03:06:32.990 --> 03:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
employers in the state already comply
 
03:06:36.410 --> 03:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
with the Bill's objective as a matter of
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
good business policy
 
03:06:40.610 --> 03:06:40.620 align:start position:0%

the story from a one of our own a member
 
03:08:07.250 --> 03:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
of this house
 
03:08:10.010 --> 03:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that in just the past
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
eight months
 
03:08:12.769 --> 03:08:12.779 align:start position:0%
the department of New Hampshire
 
03:08:15.010 --> 03:08:15.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor has
 
03:08:19.250 --> 03:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
500 wage claims and at 100 of those
 
03:08:22.910 --> 03:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
involved earned a vacation time then I
 
03:08:24.349 --> 03:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
would then was this week or would I not
 
03:08:26.210 --> 03:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
say that this is only a small number of
 
03:08:27.889 --> 03:08:27.899 align:start position:0%
people that it's a pretty significant
 
03:08:29.210 --> 03:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
number of people
 
03:08:31.730 --> 03:08:31.740 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I know this is not a
 
03:08:34.010 --> 03:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
Democratic or republican issue that's an
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
issue of fairness this is evidenced by
 
03:08:38.030 --> 03:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
the four Republican members who
 
03:08:40.429 --> 03:08:40.439 align:start position:0%

03:08:43.010 --> 03:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
press the red button so that another
 
03:08:46.550 --> 03:08:46.560 align:start position:0%

03:08:47.809 --> 03:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative
 
03:08:50.510 --> 03:08:50.520 align:start position:0%

03:08:52.429 --> 03:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:08:55.010 --> 03:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that this very well
 
03:08:56.809 --> 03:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
intended bill
 
03:08:59.690 --> 03:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
takes away the ability for employers to
 
03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
decide how to compensate and reward
 
03:09:03.650 --> 03:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
their employees
 
03:09:06.650 --> 03:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
and if I know that additional small
 
03:09:09.889 --> 03:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
minor changes to this language may be
 
03:09:11.389 --> 03:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
able to result in a bill that we could
 
03:09:13.010 --> 03:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
support or and I could I could support
 
03:09:16.610 --> 03:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
but this isn't quite it
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
if I believe business owners
 
03:09:21.889 --> 03:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
will make the right decisions on their
 
03:09:24.170 --> 03:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
policies to support their workers and
 
03:09:25.730 --> 03:09:25.740 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:13:36.410 --> 03:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
this bill repeals the statute that
 
03:13:39.230 --> 03:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
allows utilities to take credit for
 
03:13:40.910 --> 03:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
electricity produced by individual

renewable energy credits
 
03:13:49.670 --> 03:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
this practice known as wreck sweeping
 
03:13:52.849 --> 03:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
does two things that run counter to the
 
03:13:54.950 --> 03:13:54.960 align:start position:0%

03:14:14.330 --> 03:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
them and they're not required to notify
 
03:14:16.190 --> 03:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
the customers that they're taking these
 
03:14:17.990 --> 03:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
credits nor do they compensate the
 
03:14:20.269 --> 03:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
individuals for the value of the wrecks
 
03:14:22.010 --> 03:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
that they sweep
 
03:14:24.889 --> 03:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
these two points together undermine the
 
03:14:27.530 --> 03:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
value of Rex and depress the market
 
03:14:30.110 --> 03:14:30.120 align:start position:0%

in the Rex system to bring down costs

03:15:06.110 --> 03:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
on February 23rd you heard and
 
03:15:08.450 --> 03:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
considered hb234
 
03:15:12.590 --> 03:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
the OTP vote was a tie 182 to 182 the
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
itl vote failed by six votes the motion
 
03:15:17.750 --> 03:15:17.760 align:start position:0%

votes
 
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
we voted to save this bill and then by a
 
03:15:26.230 --> 03:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
wider margin we voted to pass the bill
 
03:15:28.969 --> 03:15:28.979 align:start position:0%
which is only before you again today
 
03:15:30.410 --> 03:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
because it was sent to a second
 
03:15:32.990 --> 03:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee for which neither I nor the
 
03:15:35.870 --> 03:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
committee can find any justification
 
03:15:38.570 --> 03:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
you were informed in a crescendo in a
 
03:15:40.969 --> 03:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry on the 23rd that
 
03:15:42.530 --> 03:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
this bill was opposed by the department
 
03:15:45.110 --> 03:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
of energy and I've confirmed that the
 
03:15:47.330 --> 03:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
doe takes no position on the
 
03:15:49.969 --> 03:15:49.979 align:start position:0%
legislature's ability to remediate wreck
 
03:15:51.950 --> 03:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
sweeping as a practice
 
03:15:53.990 --> 03:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
so I ask you once again to pass this
 
03:15:56.150 --> 03:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
bill so the value of renewable energy
 
03:15:58.849 --> 03:15:58.859 align:start position:0%
credits program can be restored along
 
03:16:00.830 --> 03:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
with its intent to be a lever for
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
lowering energy costs protecting our
 
03:16:06.290 --> 03:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
wallets and paychecks thank you
 
03:16:07.849 --> 03:16:07.859 align:start position:0%
do you recognize the representative Dan
 
03:16:07.859 --> 03:16:13.849 align:start position:0%
do you recognize the representative Dan
Maguire

03:16:13.849 --> 03:16:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:15.610 --> 03:16:15.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:16:18.130 --> 03:16:18.140 align:start position:0%
this bill came to us
 
03:16:21.410 --> 03:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
exactly as described we did not find
 
03:16:23.870 --> 03:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
that there's any special Financial
 
03:16:26.450 --> 03:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
aspect to it other than the fact that
 
03:16:28.849 --> 03:16:28.859 align:start position:0%
the state is a consumer of electricity
 
03:16:31.010 --> 03:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
like we all are
 
03:16:33.469 --> 03:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
so what we're going to talk about is the
 
03:16:36.110 --> 03:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
benefits or or detriment of the bill
 
03:16:36.120 --> 03:16:37.670 align:start position:0%
benefits or or detriment of the bill
itself

03:16:37.670 --> 03:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
itself
 
03:16:40.429 --> 03:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does
 
03:16:43.610 --> 03:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
is it
 
03:16:48.469 --> 03:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
um prevents utilities from reimbursing
 
03:16:51.969 --> 03:16:51.979 align:start position:0%
their customers for alternative energy
 
03:16:53.990 --> 03:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
that those
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
um those customers create but don't uh
 
03:17:02.389 --> 03:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
don't account for all right so we we
 
03:17:02.399 --> 03:17:03.910 align:start position:0%
don't account for all right so we we
require

03:17:03.910 --> 03:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
require
 
03:17:07.130 --> 03:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
utilities to provide a certain fraction
 
03:17:10.070 --> 03:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
of their energy from alternative means
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
in this case solar
 
03:17:17.330 --> 03:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
and the mechanism that the utilities use
 
03:17:20.750 --> 03:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
to prove that they're they're providing
 
03:17:22.790 --> 03:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of solar
 
03:17:25.070 --> 03:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
is quite complicated but essentially
 
03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
what happens is solar producers get
 
03:17:30.769 --> 03:17:30.779 align:start position:0%
certificates called Rex
 
03:17:34.130 --> 03:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
and then they they sell those wrecks to
 
03:17:36.590 --> 03:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
utilities utilities turn them in and say
 
03:17:39.290 --> 03:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
aha we've created so much solar
 
03:17:41.809 --> 03:17:41.819 align:start position:0%
well it turns out certain very small
 
03:17:45.230 --> 03:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
solar producers don't bother to ask for
 
03:17:48.290 --> 03:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
their wrecks because the process
 
03:17:51.610 --> 03:17:51.620 align:start position:0%
involved is complicated Etc so they they
 
03:17:53.690 --> 03:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
produce solar
 
03:17:57.889 --> 03:17:57.899 align:start position:0%
but they don't ask for the proof that
 
03:18:01.190 --> 03:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
that they have done so and so what we do
 
03:18:04.670 --> 03:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
is we know that solar is out there
 
03:18:07.610 --> 03:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
so we re we lower the requirement that
 
03:18:09.610 --> 03:18:09.620 align:start position:0%
the utilities have
 
03:18:13.190 --> 03:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
for proving how much solar they are they
 
03:18:16.870 --> 03:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
are providing all right so and the the
 
03:18:20.330 --> 03:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
amount of money involved is roughly
 
03:18:22.670 --> 03:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
three million dollars a year
 
03:18:26.090 --> 03:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
so that solar three million dollars
 
03:18:29.510 --> 03:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
worth not of energy but three million
 
03:18:32.510 --> 03:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of proof sort of
 
03:18:36.050 --> 03:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
um is being produced by solar so the
 
03:18:39.290 --> 03:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
solar is actually there the benefit for
 
03:18:42.230 --> 03:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
it is going to customers
 
03:18:46.250 --> 03:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass
 
03:18:49.490 --> 03:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
um the the what the what the sponsor of
 
03:18:51.650 --> 03:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
this bill would like is for that three
 
03:18:55.610 --> 03:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
million dollars to be instead put into
 
03:18:58.849 --> 03:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency fund because what
 
03:19:01.210 --> 03:19:01.220 align:start position:0%
normally would happen is the the
 
03:19:03.650 --> 03:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
requirements for the utilities would be
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
higher right and so they would have to
 
03:19:09.650 --> 03:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
go out and either buy wrecks from other
 
03:19:09.660 --> 03:19:11.170 align:start position:0%
go out and either buy wrecks from other
producers

03:19:11.170 --> 03:19:11.180 align:start position:0%
producers
 
03:19:15.050 --> 03:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
or pay some kind of a fine and that fine
 
03:19:18.349 --> 03:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
is what feeds the Energy Efficiency fund
 
03:19:23.210 --> 03:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
all right the problem is that
 
03:19:26.570 --> 03:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
the bills of the customers are being
 
03:19:29.090 --> 03:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
credited by the three million dollars
 
03:19:31.130 --> 03:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
the customers are paying three million
 
03:19:32.630 --> 03:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
dollars less
 
03:19:34.670 --> 03:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
than they would be otherwise if this
 
03:19:38.450 --> 03:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass right but
 
03:19:40.610 --> 03:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
that three million dollars won't
 
03:19:42.530 --> 03:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
necessarily go into the Energy
 
03:19:46.969 --> 03:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund because the utilities
 
03:19:49.190 --> 03:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
might just go out and buy wrecks from
 
03:19:51.769 --> 03:19:51.779 align:start position:0%
other people so there's no fines
 
03:19:54.170 --> 03:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
involved so there's no money going into
 
03:19:57.469 --> 03:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency fund so so the
 
03:19:59.630 --> 03:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
three million dollars that the bills
 
03:20:02.750 --> 03:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
that the consumers are paying less of
 
03:20:05.570 --> 03:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
you know is saving
 
03:20:07.610 --> 03:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
um are is for sure
 
03:20:09.950 --> 03:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
and the amount that might go into the
 
03:20:09.960 --> 03:20:11.110 align:start position:0%
and the amount that might go into the
Energy

03:20:11.110 --> 03:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
Energy
 
03:20:14.750 --> 03:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund is speculative
 
03:20:18.170 --> 03:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
all right so this is a this is a bad
 
03:20:20.809 --> 03:20:20.819 align:start position:0%
Bill for that reason let's keep our
 
03:20:24.410 --> 03:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
energy costs low I mean obviously three
 
03:20:27.410 --> 03:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars is not a big number when
 
03:20:29.690 --> 03:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
you talk about the value of all in all
 
03:20:32.750 --> 03:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
electricity but it's something so let's
 
03:20:35.750 --> 03:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
keep energy costs low and push the green
 
03:20:37.730 --> 03:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
button thank you so remember yield to
 
03:20:39.769 --> 03:20:39.779 align:start position:0%
questions yes I yes I'll take a question
 
03:20:41.929 --> 03:20:41.939 align:start position:0%
remember yields
 
03:20:43.370 --> 03:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
03:20:44.450 --> 03:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:20:47.210 --> 03:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me that the the
 
03:20:49.250 --> 03:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
so-called wrecks are basically Fiat
 
03:20:51.230 --> 03:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's created by the state through the
 
03:20:53.450 --> 03:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
RPS law and if that law were to be
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
changed so that the the RPS standards
 
03:20:57.950 --> 03:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
were higher the wrecks would be worth
 
03:21:00.050 --> 03:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
more if it was changed to make the
 
03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
requirements lower the wrecks would be
 
03:21:03.950 --> 03:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
worse less in fact if it was repealed
 
03:21:05.870 --> 03:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
the wrecks would be worth nothing so
 
03:21:08.450 --> 03:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
there's no illegal taking by the state
 
03:21:11.929 --> 03:21:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:13.969 --> 03:21:13.979 align:start position:0%
yes you're you're absolutely right the
 
03:21:16.610 --> 03:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
the rec thing is and sort of artificial

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
03:22:21.110 --> 03:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
know that this bill will repeal the
 
03:22:23.750 --> 03:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
Renewable Energy Credit scheme that is
 
03:22:26.570 --> 03:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
currently being perpetrated on our small
 
03:22:29.690 --> 03:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
energy producers some of them are our
 
03:22:32.210 --> 03:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
constituents who have renewable energy
 
03:22:33.830 --> 03:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
and are not getting the benefit of those
 
03:22:35.809 --> 03:22:35.819 align:start position:0%
wrecks and those wrecks are in effect
 
03:22:40.250 --> 03:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
being taken and further Mr Speaker if I
 
03:22:43.250 --> 03:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
know that this bill would end a vicious
 
03:22:45.950 --> 03:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
cycle of depressing the value of those
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits and further Mr
 
03:22:51.230 --> 03:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this bill would
 
03:22:54.170 --> 03:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
stop giving our money to out-of-state
 
03:22:57.469 --> 03:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
corporations large companies that
 
03:23:00.710 --> 03:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
provide energy that don't need this in
 
03:23:02.750 --> 03:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
addition to our own utilities who also
 
03:23:04.610 --> 03:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
don't need this and should be following
 
03:23:08.150 --> 03:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
their own Rec requirements would I vote
 
03:23:10.670 --> 03:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
red on this so a better motion may be
 
03:23:14.410 --> 03:23:14.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:17.450 --> 03:23:17.460 align:start position:0%

03:23:20.090 --> 03:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:23:22.670 --> 03:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that a grocery
 
03:23:25.190 --> 03:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
coupon is a lot like a renewable energy
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
certificate in that it has no value
 
03:23:31.370 --> 03:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
unless it's used or redeemed
 
03:23:33.469 --> 03:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that you need to file
 
03:23:35.870 --> 03:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
an application to create a renewable
 
03:23:37.670 --> 03:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
energy certificate
 
03:23:39.349 --> 03:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
and if you don't file it
 
03:23:41.809 --> 03:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
that wreck does not exist
 
03:23:43.429 --> 03:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
it's a phantom
 
03:23:46.070 --> 03:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
and therefore it leaves nothing to be
 
03:23:48.170 --> 03:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
swept up
 
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that every
 
03:23:53.210 --> 03:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
electricity rate payer pays for each of
 
03:23:55.790 --> 03:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
these Phantom wrecks
 
03:23:58.070 --> 03:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
would I now press the green button to
 
03:24:00.710 --> 03:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
prevent the further sweeping of dollars
 
03:24:03.889 --> 03:24:03.899 align:start position:0%

04:36:09.240 --> 04:36:11.449 align:start position:0%

it's been 22 years since I've been to
 
04:36:15.470 --> 04:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
the well and it still does feel like the
 
04:36:17.390 --> 04:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
first time
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
so I still still get right to the point
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
I rise in support of ought to pass on
 
04:36:24.410 --> 04:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment 1319 H which is exactly
 
04:36:26.570 --> 04:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
like the amendment we just passed with a
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
minor correction this amendment allows
 
04:36:33.230 --> 04:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
the funding for these accidental line of
 
04:36:35.449 --> 04:36:35.459 align:start position:0%
duty death claims to be drawn from the
 
04:36:37.010 --> 04:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
04:36:38.929 --> 04:36:38.939 align:start position:0%
so I rise in support of this amendment
 
04:36:40.609 --> 04:36:40.619 align:start position:0%
and I also rise in support of our Fire
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
EMS and police First Responders and more
 
04:36:45.470 --> 04:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
importantly for the loved ones they
 
04:36:48.470 --> 04:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:50.990 --> 04:36:51.000 align:start position:0%

04:36:56.209 --> 04:36:56.219 align:start position:0%

into this sometimes dangerous profession
 
04:37:26.869 --> 04:37:26.879 align:start position:0%
this amendment will help us do exactly
 
04:37:26.879 --> 04:37:28.010 align:start position:0%
this amendment will help us do exactly
that

04:37:28.010 --> 04:37:28.020 align:start position:0%

04:37:39.890 --> 04:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
it simply adds language to the original

applications for Education Freedom
 
04:46:19.128 --> 04:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
accounts program because this
 
04:46:22.788 --> 04:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
legislation is fair and fiscally prudent
 
04:46:26.510 --> 04:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
hb30 modifies one sentence and the
 
04:46:29.030 --> 04:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
existing EFA statute to limit applicants

or first grade
 
04:46:42.590 --> 04:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
first this legislation is fair because
 
04:46:44.510 --> 04:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
the language will honor the original
 
04:46:48.410 --> 04:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
intent of EFA accounts and the 2020
 
04:46:51.288 --> 04:46:51.298 align:start position:0%
hearings the public was told the purpose
 
04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
of esa's were to provide an alternative
 
04:46:55.970 --> 04:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
when a public school was unable to meet
 
04:46:59.030 --> 04:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
the child's particular educational needs
 
04:47:02.510 --> 04:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
efas represent an alternative a choice
 
04:47:05.570 --> 04:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
this legislation is fair because it puts
 
04:47:08.090 --> 04:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
the state back on track by making sure
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
the majority of kids taking advantage of
 
04:47:12.708 --> 04:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
the program have actually experienced
 
04:47:14.930 --> 04:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
those public schools for at least a year
 
04:47:18.050 --> 04:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
and are choosing to take their EFA Grant
 
04:47:20.208 --> 04:47:20.218 align:start position:0%
to their particular educational needs
 
04:47:22.368 --> 04:47:22.378 align:start position:0%
outside of their Public School District
 
04:47:24.110 --> 04:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
according to the Department of Education
 
04:47:26.628 --> 04:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
of approximately the 3200 students
 
04:47:28.448 --> 04:47:28.458 align:start position:0%
currently enrolled in the EFA program
 
04:47:31.970 --> 04:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
only about a hundred students made the
 
04:47:33.890 --> 04:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
actual choice to leave their Public
 
04:47:36.650 --> 04:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
School the vast majority about 89
 
04:47:38.990 --> 04:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
percent of the EFA students have never
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
experienced a public education but
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
rather were already enrolled in and
 
04:47:45.770 --> 04:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
paying for their home school or a
 
04:47:48.288 --> 04:47:48.298 align:start position:0%
private religious school as the program
 
04:47:51.530 --> 04:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
currently exists this 89 percent of EFA
 
04:47:54.288 --> 04:47:54.298 align:start position:0%
enrollees were making a different kind
 
04:47:55.730 --> 04:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
of choice
 
04:47:58.010 --> 04:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
the choice to continue paying out of
 
04:48:01.070 --> 04:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
pocket for their own education or the
 
04:48:03.170 --> 04:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
choice to get the state to help in
 
04:48:05.390 --> 04:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
paying for part of the education
 
04:48:07.850 --> 04:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
this legislation is fair because it will
 
04:48:09.948 --> 04:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
restore the program to its intended
 
04:48:13.430 --> 04:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
purpose and eliminate the windfall so

that the choice truly is being made to
 
04:48:16.730 --> 04:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
seek an alternative to New Hampshire
 
04:48:18.350 --> 04:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
public education
 
04:48:21.410 --> 04:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
second this legislation is fiscally

second this legislation is fiscally
prudent

04:48:22.730 --> 04:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
prudent
 
04:48:24.288 --> 04:48:24.298 align:start position:0%
because it would rain in the program's
 
04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
runaway spending simple math tells us
 
04:48:31.550 --> 04:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
that if 89 of the current 15.2 million
 
04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
dollar per year EFA program is suddenly
 
04:48:36.010 --> 04:48:36.020 align:start position:0%
ineligible then we can expect
 
04:48:38.750 --> 04:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
significant multi-million dollar savings
 
04:48:41.330 --> 04:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
to the state those students falling out
 
04:48:43.970 --> 04:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
of the program will either go back to
 
04:48:45.770 --> 04:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
paying for their home school private or
 
04:48:47.930 --> 04:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
religious educations without state

districts
 
04:48:57.170 --> 04:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education is if the
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is correct of
 
04:49:01.970 --> 04:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
the majority of the students enrolling
 
04:49:04.850 --> 04:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
in a public school 95 percent will
 
04:49:07.850 --> 04:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
enroll with a non-access swept community
 
04:49:10.970 --> 04:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
resulting in a net neutral result to the
 
04:49:13.490 --> 04:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
state in some this legislation is
 
04:49:15.708 --> 04:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
fiscally prudent because we can expect
 
04:49:18.590 --> 04:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
to save millions of dollars in total EFA
 
04:49:21.170 --> 04:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
spending unless there obviously be less
 
04:49:23.690 --> 04:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
pressure on the education trust fund
 
04:49:25.490 --> 04:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
we know that this legislation is
 
04:49:27.530 --> 04:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
fiscally print as well because it's
 
04:49:29.208 --> 04:49:29.218 align:start position:0%
going to help relieve pressure on Town
 
04:49:31.310 --> 04:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
and City governments in raising their
 
04:49:33.650 --> 04:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
local property taxes but don't take my
 
04:49:35.150 --> 04:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
word for it
 
04:49:37.970 --> 04:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
forbes.com has written school funding
 
04:49:40.070 --> 04:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
was reduced by the cost of the voucher
 
04:49:43.128 --> 04:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
but School expenses were reduced by zero
 
04:49:43.138 --> 04:49:44.030 align:start position:0%
but School expenses were reduced by zero
dollars

04:49:44.030 --> 04:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
so that local tax base or taxpayers are
 
04:49:48.948 --> 04:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
left to choose between cutting services
 
04:49:50.990 --> 04:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
and raising taxes
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's the quote I'll say that again
 
04:49:56.208 --> 04:49:56.218 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers are choosing between
 
04:49:58.970 --> 04:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
cutting Public School services or
 
04:50:01.310 --> 04:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
raising taxes it's not exactly the
 
04:50:02.990 --> 04:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
choice that New Hampshire was offered if
 
04:50:05.510 --> 04:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
the initial EFA program was introduced
 
04:50:08.510 --> 04:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
if this fiscally responsible legislation
 
04:50:10.610 --> 04:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
passes then the public school districts
 
04:50:12.708 --> 04:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
will be less likely to be forced to make
 
04:50:14.868 --> 04:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
the tough decision of cutting services
 
04:50:17.628 --> 04:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
or raising local property taxes and we
 
04:50:20.930 --> 04:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
can all expect less pressure
 
04:50:23.990 --> 04:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
for our local tax rates this legislation
 
04:50:25.730 --> 04:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
is clearly a win for all in New
 
04:50:27.708 --> 04:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire colleagues I look around the
 
04:50:30.770 --> 04:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
room and I know that fairness and fiscal
 
04:50:33.170 --> 04:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
responsibility are two values that we
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
all can Embrace regardless of the side
 
04:50:38.208 --> 04:50:38.218 align:start position:0%
of the political aisle we sit on please
 
04:50:40.250 --> 04:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
join me in honoring this Chambers
 
04:50:45.530 --> 04:50:45.540 align:start position:0%

04:50:53.810 --> 04:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I requested

no member does not yield chair recognize
 
04:51:08.570 --> 04:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:10.910 --> 04:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:51:14.990 --> 04:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
I view House Bill 430 as an unnecessary
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
why require
 
04:51:24.650 --> 04:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
every student to go to school for a year
 
04:51:26.930 --> 04:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
in a public school if there's already
 
04:51:29.208 --> 04:51:29.218 align:start position:0%
been an older sibling that the parents
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
have determined
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
that this was not what they wanted for
 
04:51:35.330 --> 04:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
their children they could make the
 
04:51:37.850 --> 04:51:37.860 align:start position:0%
choice for an older child why do this
 
04:51:40.010 --> 04:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
this would make the younger child have
 
04:51:41.150 --> 04:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
to go
 
04:51:42.890 --> 04:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
even though the parents didn't approve
 
04:51:44.270 --> 04:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
of the school
 
04:51:46.730 --> 04:51:46.740 align:start position:0%
or if someone moved from somewhere else
 
04:51:48.890 --> 04:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
where they already had some relationship
 
04:51:51.650 --> 04:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
with a a charter school or some other
 
04:51:53.570 --> 04:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
school that they wanted to send their
 
04:51:55.610 --> 04:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
child to why would they why should they
 
04:51:58.788 --> 04:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
be required to send this child
 
04:52:01.070 --> 04:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
to a public school for a year
 
04:52:04.850 --> 04:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
that's an unnecessary roadblock and it
 
04:52:07.970 --> 04:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't recognize some of the costs
 
04:52:10.190 --> 04:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
we are also recognizing that the public
 
04:52:11.868 --> 04:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
schools are spending around twenty
 
04:52:14.150 --> 04:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per pupil
 
04:52:16.128 --> 04:52:16.138 align:start position:0%
parents are choosing an option that's
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
about five thousand dollars
 
04:52:21.650 --> 04:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
and yet they're more satisfied with it
 
04:52:25.190 --> 04:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
so yes there's a choice the public
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
school should need to be reducing as
 
04:52:30.770 --> 04:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
they are anyway because of the decline
 
04:52:32.030 --> 04:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
in enrollment
 
04:52:34.610 --> 04:52:34.620 align:start position:0%
so this is just the same thing that's
 
04:52:37.490 --> 04:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
going on whether the student goes to
 
04:52:39.530 --> 04:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh on different school or whether the
 
04:52:41.448 --> 04:52:41.458 align:start position:0%
enrollment enrollment declines they
 
04:52:43.430 --> 04:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
should be adjusting for that without
 
04:52:44.990 --> 04:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
claiming they're losing a lot of money
 
04:52:47.330 --> 04:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
and we're costing them money we're
 
04:52:49.970 --> 04:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
actually educating the education Freedom
 
04:52:52.970 --> 04:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
accounts for a lot less money so let's
 
04:52:55.430 --> 04:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
recognize that let's support parental
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
Choice let's support what's best for the
 
04:52:59.390 --> 04:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
child and there are many families that
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
will divide their children one may be in
 
04:53:03.530 --> 04:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
a different school and the others may be
 
04:53:05.810 --> 04:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
in the in the public school depends on
 
04:53:08.150 --> 04:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
what works best for their child why do
 
04:53:10.730 --> 04:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
we put roadblocks please support the
 
04:53:10.740 --> 04:53:12.708 align:start position:0%
we put roadblocks please support the
congression

04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
congression
 
04:53:15.730 --> 04:53:15.740 align:start position:0%
remember yield a question
 
04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
yes member yields
 
04:53:22.250 --> 04:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:24.230 --> 04:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
04:53:24.240 --> 04:53:25.730 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank you
representative

04:53:25.730 --> 04:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:53:28.010 --> 04:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
um we've heard that the bill requires a
 
04:53:29.810 --> 04:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
student to be in public school for a
 
04:53:32.330 --> 04:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
year but when I was reading the bill the
 
04:53:34.250 --> 04:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
definition of a child who is eligible
 
04:53:36.650 --> 04:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
says you just have to be eligible to
 
04:53:39.050 --> 04:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
attend a public school I'm confused can
 
04:53:44.390 --> 04:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:46.788 --> 04:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
it puts a requirement to have that child
 
04:53:48.890 --> 04:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
go to the public school even though
 
04:53:51.170 --> 04:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for something else so
 
04:53:53.030 --> 04:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
it could be debatable and it could
 
04:53:56.570 --> 04:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
depend on how it's interpreted but I
 
04:53:58.368 --> 04:53:58.378 align:start position:0%
think the intent is to make it more
 
04:54:03.190 --> 04:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
the Marshall before us is inexpedient to
 
04:54:08.050 --> 04:54:08.060 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 430
 
04:54:10.128 --> 04:54:10.138 align:start position:0%
representative Senator natasto has
 
04:54:11.930 --> 04:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call it is sufficiently
 
04:54:13.788 --> 04:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
seconded this will be a roll call vote
 
04:54:23.110 --> 04:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:54.470 --> 04:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:54.480 --> 04:54:57.708 align:start position:0%
 
we're

04:54:57.708 --> 04:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:59.270 --> 04:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
the motion before is the majority
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
committee report of inexpension to
 
04:55:02.810 --> 04:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
legislator and House Bill 430 this is a
 
04:55:04.670 --> 04:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
roll-call vote
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Kate Murray for a
 
04:55:15.530 --> 04:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:17.390 --> 04:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the education
 
04:55:19.970 --> 04:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts are created to provide
 
04:55:22.128 --> 04:55:22.138 align:start position:0%
an alternative to students who find
 
04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
their public school is unable to meet
 
04:55:26.208 --> 04:55:26.218 align:start position:0%
their particular needs and if I find
 
04:55:28.250 --> 04:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
that every child is an individual and
 
04:55:29.510 --> 04:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
for some of those children the public
 
04:55:32.330 --> 04:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
school does meet those needs and if I
 
04:55:34.550 --> 04:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
also know that this bill reinforces the
 
04:55:36.530 --> 04:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
intent and honors the intent of the
 
04:55:40.190 --> 04:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
original bill which passed this house on
 
04:55:43.430 --> 04:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
February 23rd when I now press the red
 
04:55:44.990 --> 04:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
button to overturn the itl

thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:59:50.150 --> 04:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues I Rise Against the motion of
 
04:59:53.750 --> 04:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
itl of HB 534 because this bipartisan
 
04:59:56.628 --> 04:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
legislation supported by the Des and the
 
04:59:58.390 --> 04:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
05:00:01.850 --> 05:00:01.860 align:start position:0%
reflects good policy that will improve
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
the lives of the most needy Granite
 
05:00:05.448 --> 05:00:05.458 align:start position:0%
Staters with when a natural disaster
 
05:00:07.970 --> 05:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
strikes and they need to restore access
 
05:00:10.070 --> 05:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
to clean drinking water for their
 
05:00:11.690 --> 05:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
private well
 
05:00:15.650 --> 05:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
HB 534 Builds on an existing program but
 
05:00:17.448 --> 05:00:17.458 align:start position:0%
these temporary program funds are
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
running dry
 
05:00:21.050 --> 05:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
in 2020 New Hampshire drinking water and
 
05:00:23.390 --> 05:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
groundwater advisory commission began
 
05:00:25.550 --> 05:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
its work administering a temporary
 
05:00:29.090 --> 05:00:29.100 align:start position:0%
emergency trust fund with 3.2 million
 
05:00:31.310 --> 05:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
dollars part of this trust fund is
 
05:00:33.650 --> 05:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
earmarked for Community water system
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
assistance and 1.5 million dollars was
 
05:00:39.230 --> 05:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
earmarked for private well assistance to
 
05:00:41.390 --> 05:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
low-income homeowners
 
05:00:45.288 --> 05:00:45.298 align:start position:0%
to date 147 processed States have
 
05:00:48.050 --> 05:00:48.060 align:start position:0%
received emergency water access after
 
05:00:50.690 --> 05:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
natural disasters we know the program is
 
05:00:52.670 --> 05:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
working because the trust funds balance
 
05:00:54.650 --> 05:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
is now at four hundred thousand and
 
05:00:57.050 --> 05:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
there's no plan to replenish it so after
 
05:00:59.090 --> 05:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
the three years of this good work by the
 
05:01:01.310 --> 05:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
commission they recommend a permanent
 
05:01:03.470 --> 05:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund be established to meet
 
05:01:05.628 --> 05:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
projected future needs of natural
 
05:01:09.708 --> 05:01:09.718 align:start position:0%
disaster victims this bill establishes
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
that permanent dedicated non-lapsing
 
05:01:14.390 --> 05:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
fund called the water assistance for
 
05:01:16.850 --> 05:01:16.860 align:start position:0%
natural disasters fund and it
 
05:01:19.070 --> 05:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
appropriates 2.5 million dollars in both
 
05:01:21.410 --> 05:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
years of the biennium for the purpose of
 
05:01:24.590 --> 05:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
replacing repairing and treating private
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
drinking water sources in the event of a
 
05:01:28.550 --> 05:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
natural disaster for the state's most
 
05:01:31.850 --> 05:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged homeowners
 
05:01:34.670 --> 05:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
critics will argue that this bill gives
 
05:01:37.850 --> 05:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
broad rulemaking authority to the Des in
 
05:01:40.310 --> 05:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
violation of house rules but we know the
 
05:01:42.530 --> 05:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
commissions has existing applicant
 
05:01:44.448 --> 05:01:44.458 align:start position:0%
eligibility guidelines that are based in
 
05:01:47.390 --> 05:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
HUD income limits particular to New
 
05:01:49.368 --> 05:01:49.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's medium household income
 
05:01:52.430 --> 05:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications and definitions we also
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
know that the commission's guidelines
 
05:01:56.690 --> 05:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
require applicants to document their
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
financial need and to demonstrate that
 
05:02:00.770 --> 05:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
they've exhausted all other available
 
05:02:04.150 --> 05:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
funding sources this bill authorizes Des
 
05:02:06.770 --> 05:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
to create application and acceptance
 
05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
criteria and applicable rules for
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
administering the new fund using
 
05:02:14.030 --> 05:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
existing commission guidelines so that
 
05:02:16.368 --> 05:02:16.378 align:start position:0%
there's a continuity of the temporary
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
program and it moves forward to the
 
05:02:19.730 --> 05:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
permanent program
 
05:02:22.190 --> 05:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
critics will also argue that the build
 
05:02:24.650 --> 05:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
creates a fund that already exists for a
 
05:02:26.270 --> 05:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
problem that is addressed by FEMA
 
05:02:28.490 --> 05:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
declarations and our rainy day funds
 
05:02:30.770 --> 05:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
however there's a gap
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
please understand on the one hand there
 
05:02:35.930 --> 05:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
are large-scale natural disasters or
 
05:02:38.570 --> 05:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
FEMA declarations come Federal funding
 
05:02:40.730 --> 05:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire rainy day funds swoop
 
05:02:42.110 --> 05:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
into assist
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand there are small
 
05:02:47.330 --> 05:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
case droughts and floods where there are
 
05:02:48.530 --> 05:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
families in need but there's no
 
05:02:50.390 --> 05:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
financial assistance to come from the
 
05:02:53.810 --> 05:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
state the fed or our municipalities and
 
05:02:55.850 --> 05:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
don't forget that private property
 
05:02:58.610 --> 05:02:58.620 align:start position:0%
insurance Force measure Clauses prevents
 
05:03:01.010 --> 05:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
assistance to these people this
 
05:03:04.010 --> 05:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
legislation fills that Gap
 
05:03:07.010 --> 05:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
let's face the facts our state is in the
 
05:03:08.448 --> 05:03:08.458 align:start position:0%
fourth year of a drought
 
05:03:09.948 --> 05:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
and those conditions while they're
 
05:03:09.958 --> 05:03:11.448 align:start position:0%
and those conditions while they're
lessening

05:03:11.448 --> 05:03:11.458 align:start position:0%
lessening
 
05:03:13.368 --> 05:03:13.378 align:start position:0%
we know we must be prepared to meet the
 
05:03:13.378 --> 05:03:14.628 align:start position:0%
we know we must be prepared to meet the
future

05:03:14.628 --> 05:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:03:16.310 --> 05:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
I call your attention to the real
 
05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
Financial concerns that the entire state
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
will face over time private wells in the
 
05:03:24.288 --> 05:03:24.298 align:start position:0%
rural areas of our state will run dry
 
05:03:26.570 --> 05:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
and the neediest families cannot pay to
 
05:03:29.208 --> 05:03:29.218 align:start position:0%
have their world's restored then they're
 
05:03:31.190 --> 05:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
going to be forced to migrate to more
 
05:03:33.650 --> 05:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
urbanized settings
 
05:03:35.750 --> 05:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
those rural property values are going to
 
05:03:35.760 --> 05:03:36.770 align:start position:0%
those rural property values are going to
plummet

05:03:36.770 --> 05:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
plummet
 
05:03:39.230 --> 05:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
and when those Urban Street pipes need
 
05:03:42.230 --> 05:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
to expand it's going to cost far more in
 
05:03:44.090 --> 05:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
time and resources to grow and maintain
 
05:03:47.090 --> 05:03:47.100 align:start position:0%
those large-scale projects that five
 
05:03:49.490 --> 05:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
million dollar that this bill proposes
 
05:03:52.310 --> 05:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
that allocation is a far cheaper
 
05:03:54.410 --> 05:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
Financial commitment than the cost of
 
05:03:56.570 --> 05:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
reversing economically depressed rural
 
05:03:59.090 --> 05:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
areas and keeping Pace with ever
 
05:04:01.010 --> 05:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
increasing Urban infrastructure needs
 
05:04:05.930 --> 05:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
finally HB 534 is one important piece of
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
the puzzle that will help us solve our
 
05:04:10.730 --> 05:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
housing stock and affordability crisis
 
05:04:13.190 --> 05:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
which we all know is plaguing our state
 
05:04:15.230 --> 05:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
as a legislature with a special
 
05:04:17.208 --> 05:04:17.218 align:start position:0%
committee on housing we recognize
 
05:04:18.770 --> 05:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
something must be done at the state
 
05:04:20.990 --> 05:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
level to ameliorate this crisis
 
05:04:23.628 --> 05:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
HB 534
 
05:04:25.730 --> 05:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
will keep our most vulnerable people in
 
05:04:27.110 --> 05:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
their homes longer
 
05:04:29.810 --> 05:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
imagine losing your well after a natural
 
05:04:32.090 --> 05:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
disaster and being forced to move out
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
with almost nowhere in the state to go
 
05:04:37.250 --> 05:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
let's do our part and help increase well
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
access so that our poorest community
 
05:04:41.208 --> 05:04:41.218 align:start position:0%
members only have to deal with one
 
05:04:43.070 --> 05:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
crisis at a time
 
05:04:45.470 --> 05:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I hope you'll join me
 
05:04:46.910 --> 05:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
in supporting this legislation and
 
05:04:50.030 --> 05:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
overturning the itl motion
 
05:04:52.010 --> 05:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
um so that another motion may be made
 
05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I do request a
 
05:04:56.150 --> 05:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
division vote
 
05:04:57.650 --> 05:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
do you recognize representative Dan
 
05:04:57.660 --> 05:05:00.948 align:start position:0%
do you recognize representative Dan
Maguire

05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:04.190 --> 05:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker this bill is very
 
05:05:06.530 --> 05:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
well intentioned but it has problems
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
both in concept and in execution
 
05:05:12.310 --> 05:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
first of all the concept so this bill
 
05:05:16.610 --> 05:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
creates a special purpose fund to
 
05:05:16.620 --> 05:05:17.448 align:start position:0%
creates a special purpose fund to
um

05:05:17.448 --> 05:05:17.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:21.490 --> 05:05:21.500 align:start position:0%
give out money in the case of
 
05:05:25.070 --> 05:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
drinking water problems caused by a
 
05:05:27.490 --> 05:05:27.500 align:start position:0%
natural disaster
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
the problem is when a natural disaster
 
05:05:30.958 --> 05:05:33.170 align:start position:0%
the problem is when a natural disaster
occurs

05:05:33.170 --> 05:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
05:05:36.470 --> 05:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
um it can be of any kind not just one
 
05:05:40.850 --> 05:05:40.860 align:start position:0%
that happens to affect drinking water we
 
05:05:42.530 --> 05:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
could have a natural disaster that
 
05:05:46.010 --> 05:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
washes out roads or Bridges or effects
 
05:05:49.010 --> 05:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
sewer systems or electricity or what
 
05:05:52.610 --> 05:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
have you right and so what do we do to
 
05:05:55.610 --> 05:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
prepare for natural disasters is we have
 
05:05:57.650 --> 05:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
a general purpose fund it's called the
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund and so when something
 
05:06:03.530 --> 05:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
unusual happens like a natural disaster
 
05:06:06.948 --> 05:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
a big lawsuit or something like that we
 
05:06:09.410 --> 05:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
have general purpose dollars put aside
 
05:06:11.690 --> 05:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
to take care of it
 
05:06:15.948 --> 05:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes that for the case of
 
05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
a natural disaster that affects drinking
 
05:06:21.590 --> 05:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
water specifically we have a fund of
 
05:06:23.628 --> 05:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
five million dollars for that
 
05:06:25.730 --> 05:06:25.740 align:start position:0%
well what if the natural disaster does
 
05:06:29.690 --> 05:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
something else right it's silly to have
 
05:06:32.810 --> 05:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
this five million dollars somehow in a
 
05:06:35.208 --> 05:06:35.218 align:start position:0%
special kind of an account rather than
 
05:06:38.810 --> 05:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
just boosting the rainy day fund which
 
05:06:41.390 --> 05:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
can handle any kind of a disaster or any
 
05:06:43.010 --> 05:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
kind of a problem
 
05:06:45.770 --> 05:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
secondly the way the bill is written
 
05:06:49.090 --> 05:06:49.100 align:start position:0%
so the we have a house rule house rule
 
05:06:53.810 --> 05:06:53.820 align:start position:0%
45d which tells us not to pass any
 
05:06:55.910 --> 05:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that has broad rulemaking
 
05:06:55.920 --> 05:06:57.170 align:start position:0%
legislation that has broad rulemaking
Authority

05:06:57.170 --> 05:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
05:07:00.050 --> 05:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
broad rule banking Authority means that
 
05:07:02.650 --> 05:07:02.660 align:start position:0%
we just tell an agency
 
05:07:06.288 --> 05:07:06.298 align:start position:0%
here's our goal you go figure out how to
 
05:07:07.730 --> 05:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
do it and how much you're going to spend
 
05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
on it and all that sort of thing
 
05:07:13.670 --> 05:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
so this bill does not specify what is a
 
05:07:16.190 --> 05:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
natural disaster it doesn't specify who
 
05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
is eligible to apply for funds it
 
05:07:20.690 --> 05:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify whether these are grants
 
05:07:22.090 --> 05:07:22.100 align:start position:0%
or loans
 
05:07:25.610 --> 05:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
it doesn't specify the criteria by which
 
05:07:28.490 --> 05:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
money is dispersed you know are we
 
05:07:29.930 --> 05:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
paying for a hundred percent of the
 
05:07:32.208 --> 05:07:32.218 align:start position:0%
problem or 50 of the problem or ten
 
05:07:34.070 --> 05:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
percent of the problem is it somehow
 
05:07:36.470 --> 05:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
matching money none of that is in the
 
05:07:39.970 --> 05:07:39.980 align:start position:0%
bill and and in particular What's worst
 
05:07:44.510 --> 05:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
is the bill says that Des May charge
 
05:07:47.510 --> 05:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
their expenses to the fund
 
05:07:49.788 --> 05:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
but there are absolutely no limits on
 
05:07:52.610 --> 05:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
that right it's not like 10 percent of
 
05:07:54.230 --> 05:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
the disbursements can be used for
 
05:07:56.448 --> 05:07:56.458 align:start position:0%
expenses or something like that it just
 
05:07:59.030 --> 05:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
says charge your expenses to the fund so
 
05:08:01.070 --> 05:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
this is the very definition of broad
 
05:08:03.770 --> 05:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
rule making Authority and
 
05:08:06.530 --> 05:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
um you know it's there's there's good
 
05:08:06.540 --> 05:08:08.270 align:start position:0%
um you know it's there's there's good
intentions

05:08:08.270 --> 05:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
intentions
 
05:08:11.330 --> 05:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
um we were I believe formally in a
 
05:08:13.310 --> 05:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
drought we are not currently in a
 
05:08:16.850 --> 05:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
drought and so there are better ways to
 
05:08:19.250 --> 05:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
accomplish the same task thank you Mr
 
05:08:19.260 --> 05:08:22.190 align:start position:0%
accomplish the same task thank you Mr
Speaker

05:08:22.190 --> 05:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:24.770 --> 05:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative Senator was requested a
 
05:08:26.750 --> 05:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
roll call it is officially seconded this
 
05:09:09.830 --> 05:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
05:09:13.190 --> 05:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
committee report of inexperienced
 
05:09:15.770 --> 05:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
legislative House Bill 534 this is a
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
roll call vote care recognizes
 
05:09:19.490 --> 05:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
representative Bill Boyd for a
 
05:09:25.150 --> 05:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:29.208 --> 05:09:29.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
if I know that establishing a five
 
05:09:33.288 --> 05:09:33.298 align:start position:0%
million dollar non-lapsing water
 
05:09:35.628 --> 05:09:35.638 align:start position:0%
assistance for natural disaster fund
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
administered by the Department of
 
05:09:39.708 --> 05:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services would help keep
 
05:09:41.868 --> 05:09:41.878 align:start position:0%
the most economically vulnerable granted
 
05:09:41.878 --> 05:09:43.730 align:start position:0%
the most economically vulnerable granted
Staters

05:09:43.730 --> 05:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
Staters
 
05:09:46.070 --> 05:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
to replace repair and treat their
 
05:09:48.590 --> 05:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
private drinking sources in event of a
 
05:09:49.970 --> 05:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
natural disaster
 
05:09:52.250 --> 05:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I further know that
 
05:09:54.230 --> 05:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
slow-moving natural natural disasters
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
like droughts and small-scale flooding
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
may not trigger FEMA declarations and
 
05:10:02.448 --> 05:10:02.458 align:start position:0%
that Associated Federal funding for this
 
05:10:05.208 --> 05:10:05.218 align:start position:0%
legislation would fill the policy Gap to
 
05:10:07.610 --> 05:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
help economically vulnerable homeowners
 
05:10:10.250 --> 05:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
gain access to clean drinking water when
 
05:10:12.590 --> 05:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
they're well strung run dry
 
05:10:14.990 --> 05:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
and lastly Mr Speaker if I further know
 
05:10:17.330 --> 05:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
that providing financial assistance to
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
restore dry Wells has a strong return on
 
05:10:22.430 --> 05:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
investment because it keeps New
 
05:10:24.110 --> 05:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's most vulnerable homeowners
 
05:10:27.110 --> 05:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
in their homes increases property values
 
05:10:30.050 --> 05:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
and prevents the exacerbation of our
 
05:10:32.690 --> 05:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
affordable housing crisis then Mr
 
05:10:34.550 --> 05:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
Speaker would I now press the red button
 
05:10:37.610 --> 05:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
against inexpedient to legislate so that
 
05:10:40.310 --> 05:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
another motion may be made thank you Mr
 
05:10:40.320 --> 05:10:41.270 align:start position:0%
another motion may be made thank you Mr
Speaker

05:10:41.270 --> 05:10:41.280 align:start position:0%

thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
05:14:29.150 --> 05:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 626 would require the New
 
05:14:31.490 --> 05:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education to
 
05:14:33.350 --> 05:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
administer the education Freedom account
 
05:14:37.610 --> 05:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
program that's right HB 626 would have
 
05:14:39.410 --> 05:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
the department that's currently
 
05:14:42.410 --> 05:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
responsible for over 165 000 New
 
05:14:45.230 --> 05:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students to administer a
 
05:14:47.690 --> 05:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
program that serves approximately 3 200
 
05:14:47.700 --> 05:14:48.948 align:start position:0%
program that serves approximately 3 200
students

05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:14:51.650 --> 05:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
it would cost taxpayers less than the 10
 
05:14:53.390 --> 05:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
percent being charged now by the
 
05:14:55.910 --> 05:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
contractor to manage the program
 
05:14:58.430 --> 05:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
it would be more responsible because the
 
05:15:00.650 --> 05:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
department would know how tax dollars
 
05:15:02.750 --> 05:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
are actually being spent
 
05:15:04.250 --> 05:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
and it would be accountable to the
 
05:15:07.490 --> 05:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
voters all good things
 
05:15:09.410 --> 05:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
we got it right when we when we all
 
05:15:11.868 --> 05:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
voted to pass this bill back in February
 
05:15:14.990 --> 05:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
let's overturn the ITIL motion now so
 
05:15:17.810 --> 05:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
that we can pass this bill again thank
 
05:15:26.930 --> 05:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:29.270 --> 05:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker you might be
 
05:15:30.890 --> 05:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
surprised to know the Department of
 
05:15:32.990 --> 05:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
Education is already supervising and
 
05:15:34.368 --> 05:15:34.378 align:start position:0%
managing this program
 
05:15:36.590 --> 05:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
they manage the contract and they're
 
05:15:39.890 --> 05:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
putting out an RFP this month to see if
 
05:15:42.050 --> 05:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
there are other providers there's a
 
05:15:43.628 --> 05:15:43.638 align:start position:0%
little catch in this you have to be
 
05:15:46.510 --> 05:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
approved by RSA
 
05:15:49.930 --> 05:15:49.940 align:start position:0%
77r don't ask me
 
05:15:52.190 --> 05:15:52.200 align:start position:0%
there was only one vendor in the state
 
05:15:53.868 --> 05:15:53.878 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that had that approval
 
05:15:55.788 --> 05:15:55.798 align:start position:0%
and that's the current vendor that we're
 
05:15:55.798 --> 05:15:57.170 align:start position:0%
and that's the current vendor that we're
using

05:15:57.170 --> 05:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
using
 
05:16:00.350 --> 05:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
the current vendor has processed forty
 
05:16:00.360 --> 05:16:01.788 align:start position:0%
the current vendor has processed forty
thousand

05:16:01.788 --> 05:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
05:16:05.750 --> 05:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh orders on this on this program it's
 
05:16:08.390 --> 05:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
about 10 orders per student because
 
05:16:10.250 --> 05:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
basically what's happening students are
 
05:16:12.230 --> 05:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
unbundling their education the parents
 
05:16:14.270 --> 05:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
are so they might have a tutor for this
 
05:16:16.310 --> 05:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
and a textbook for that and an online
 
05:16:19.550 --> 05:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
course for this so it's unbundling to
 
05:16:23.150 --> 05:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:26.448 --> 05:16:26.458 align:start position:0%
they have the vendor has 12 full-time
 
05:16:30.288 --> 05:16:30.298 align:start position:0%
employees to administer this the 5000
 
05:16:32.690 --> 05:16:32.700 align:start position:0%
initial applications cooked down to the
 
05:16:34.430 --> 05:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
3200 you've heard mentioned several
 
05:16:34.440 --> 05:16:35.270 align:start position:0%
3200 you've heard mentioned several
times

05:16:35.270 --> 05:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
times
 
05:16:38.570 --> 05:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
they have to re-register every year so
 
05:16:42.050 --> 05:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
come September everybody's at zero they
 
05:16:44.208 --> 05:16:44.218 align:start position:0%
got to start all over again so this is
 
05:16:46.010 --> 05:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
not something that somebody in the
 
05:16:47.330 --> 05:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
department of education is going to do
 
05:16:49.550 --> 05:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
on a part-time basis this is a lot of
 
05:16:51.708 --> 05:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
work and the vendor is being supervised
 
05:16:53.868 --> 05:16:53.878 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education so please
 
05:16:57.830 --> 05:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
press the green button for itl thank you
 
05:16:59.868 --> 05:16:59.878 align:start position:0%
motion before us majority committed
 
05:17:01.610 --> 05:17:01.620 align:start position:0%

05:17:52.610 --> 05:17:52.620 align:start position:0%

05:17:58.368 --> 05:17:58.378 align:start position:0%
House Bill 626
 
05:18:01.128 --> 05:18:01.138 align:start position:0%
house will be in order
 
05:18:03.110 --> 05:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote chair
 
05:18:04.670 --> 05:18:04.680 align:start position:0%

05:18:15.590 --> 05:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:17.270 --> 05:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that this bill
 
05:18:19.010 --> 05:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
moves the oversight of the freedom
 
05:18:21.050 --> 05:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts to our own
 
05:18:22.970 --> 05:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and what
 
05:18:25.010 --> 05:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
oversight there may be now I think can
 
05:18:26.628 --> 05:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
be further enhanced by having it
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
actually housed in our Department of
 
05:18:29.280 --> 05:18:30.470 align:start position:0%
actually housed in our Department of
Education

05:18:30.470 --> 05:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
Education
 
05:18:32.270 --> 05:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this is a modest
 
05:18:35.150 --> 05:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
responsible proposal which will provide
 
05:18:35.160 --> 05:18:36.230 align:start position:0%
responsible proposal which will provide
better

05:18:36.230 --> 05:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:18:38.510 --> 05:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal oversight and an increased
 
05:18:41.448 --> 05:18:41.458 align:start position:0%
transport transparency and better local
 
05:18:44.510 --> 05:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
management that can what be found by an
 
05:18:47.690 --> 05:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
out-of-state private Enterprise and that
 
05:18:49.310 --> 05:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education by having
 
05:18:51.708 --> 05:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
the oversight of this program housed
 
05:18:54.590 --> 05:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
within its own Chambers is able to Prov
 
05:18:57.050 --> 05:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
is able to do an RFP is able to reach
 
05:18:58.850 --> 05:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
out in a way that's appropriate to them
 
05:19:01.250 --> 05:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
for less money than what apparently we
 
05:19:02.510 --> 05:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
are paying now
 
05:19:04.250 --> 05:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
and if I know this bill passed the Full
 
05:19:07.128 --> 05:19:07.138 align:start position:0%
House in February would I now press the
 
05:19:08.990 --> 05:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
red button to overturn the itl
 
05:19:10.850 --> 05:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
recommendation so another motion may be
 
05:19:13.490 --> 05:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
paid made that reflects the will of this
 
05:19:15.470 --> 05:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
house as demonstrated in past February
 
05:19:17.628 --> 05:19:17.638 align:start position:0%

if I know that the success

of the education Freedom account is
 
05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
basically due to the present vendor
 
05:19:37.190 --> 05:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
who has really gone out of her way to
 
05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
recruit funds and to recruit people and
 
05:19:43.368 --> 05:19:43.378 align:start position:0%
if I further know that when this there's
 
05:19:44.750 --> 05:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
a short window when all these
 
05:19:47.510 --> 05:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
applications come in requiring sometimes
 
05:19:50.690 --> 05:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
10 hour days six days a week which would
 
05:19:54.110 --> 05:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
not be easily adaptable to the education

05:19:57.948 --> 05:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
people year round for that rush time
 
05:19:59.208 --> 05:19:59.218 align:start position:0%
when they really don't need them the
 
05:20:02.330 --> 05:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
rest of the time so knowing that this
 
05:20:04.310 --> 05:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
program is successful that it has been
 
05:20:06.948 --> 05:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
supervised and that it's working the way
 
05:20:08.810 --> 05:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
it is because of the way we have it set
 
05:20:11.090 --> 05:20:11.100 align:start position:0%

capitalism

05:24:51.650 --> 05:24:51.660 align:start position:0%
capitalism
 
05:24:54.170 --> 05:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
and it tells of the government throwing
 
05:24:56.868 --> 05:24:56.878 align:start position:0%
your money at favored constituents the
 
05:24:58.490 --> 05:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
economic leak
 
05:25:01.310 --> 05:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
and this is a prime example
 
05:25:03.350 --> 05:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
we were told that this is going on for
 
05:25:04.970 --> 05:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
05:25:08.090 --> 05:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
well if there was a need at some time I
 
05:25:10.250 --> 05:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
certainly don't see it now
 
05:25:12.288 --> 05:25:12.298 align:start position:0%
we're told that rail keeps the trucks
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
off the New Hampshire roads and that's
 
05:25:14.638 --> 05:25:15.830 align:start position:0%
off the New Hampshire roads and that's
true

05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
true
 
05:25:17.628 --> 05:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any reason that that
 
05:25:20.810 --> 05:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
would change CSX railroad is making too
 
05:25:23.510 --> 05:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
high of a profit in Boston sand and
 
05:25:25.910 --> 05:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
gravel saves too much money using that
 
05:25:25.920 --> 05:25:28.128 align:start position:0%
gravel saves too much money using that
system

05:25:28.128 --> 05:25:28.138 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:25:30.890 --> 05:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
said that we that they pay to use the
 
05:25:33.350 --> 05:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
tracks and the rights away and they
 
05:25:35.930 --> 05:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
could well afford to do that and should
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
it said that we subsidize bus lines and
 
05:25:41.628 --> 05:25:41.638 align:start position:0%
airports the difference being this is
 
05:25:44.930 --> 05:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
Freight not people
 
05:25:47.690 --> 05:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is Freight rail is
 
05:25:50.090 --> 05:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
hugely profitable it doesn't need
 
05:25:50.100 --> 05:25:52.310 align:start position:0%
hugely profitable it doesn't need
subsidies

05:25:52.310 --> 05:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
subsidies
 
05:25:55.430 --> 05:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
this should not be a partisan issue we
 
05:25:57.050 --> 05:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
are all responsible for spending
 
05:25:59.208 --> 05:25:59.218 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money carefully
 
05:26:02.750 --> 05:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
how can you justify transferring your
 
05:26:04.850 --> 05:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
constituents money to 21st century
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%

05:26:09.050 --> 05:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
many legitimate needs are addressed in
 
05:26:10.788 --> 05:26:10.798 align:start position:0%

subsidies is not one of them
 
05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment simply deletes the 750

as ought to pass with Amendment
 
05:36:38.570 --> 05:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Pete speaker I apologize we
 
05:36:40.850 --> 05:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
didn't quite get our ducks in order
 
05:36:44.810 --> 05:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
on about a century ago cannabis was
 
05:36:47.090 --> 05:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
wrongly classified as a drug as
 
05:36:49.070 --> 05:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous as heroin
 
05:36:51.590 --> 05:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
it is less addictive than the liquor
 
05:36:54.590 --> 05:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
that we sell for our profit
 
05:36:56.570 --> 05:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
all of our neighboring states have
 
05:36:59.590 --> 05:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
legalized adult cannabis use
 
05:37:02.810 --> 05:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and sales they regulate
 
05:37:05.510 --> 05:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
potency and quality labeling and
 
05:37:08.208 --> 05:37:08.218 align:start position:0%
education we do not
 
05:37:10.610 --> 05:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
yet most of our citizens live with an
 
05:37:15.410 --> 05:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:17.930 --> 05:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
Point number one aren't we safer in the
 
05:37:22.070 --> 05:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
long run if we do also regulate cannabis
 
05:37:24.590 --> 05:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
use and work to protect against its
 
05:37:24.600 --> 05:37:26.448 align:start position:0%
use and work to protect against its
abuse

05:37:26.448 --> 05:37:26.458 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
05:37:29.628 --> 05:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
Point number two we intend to undercut
 
05:37:32.570 --> 05:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
the price of legal cannabis in this
 
05:37:35.390 --> 05:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
region and to try to become the first
 
05:37:38.990 --> 05:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
state to wipe out the black market
 
05:37:41.930 --> 05:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
Point number three we have too many
 
05:37:44.570 --> 05:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
citizens that would have become assets
 
05:37:47.510 --> 05:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
to our state and our communities
 
05:37:49.970 --> 05:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
but whose life chances were cut short
 
05:37:51.650 --> 05:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
because they were convicted of
 
05:37:54.650 --> 05:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
possession or sale of cannabis
 
05:37:56.810 --> 05:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
criminal records stopped them from
 
05:37:59.350 --> 05:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
gainful employment and stable home lives
 
05:38:03.948 --> 05:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
this bill ends future tragedies
 
05:38:06.410 --> 05:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
please listen carefully to my esteemed
 
05:38:09.050 --> 05:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
colleagues description of the committee
 
05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment but of the the changes that we

Means accepted the broad policy
 
05:38:44.990 --> 05:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
formulation adopted by this chamber in
 
05:38:47.390 --> 05:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
February and limited its review to
 
05:38:50.930 --> 05:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
matters of taxes revenues fees and
 
05:38:50.940 --> 05:38:52.310 align:start position:0%
matters of taxes revenues fees and

funding
 
05:38:55.070 --> 05:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
it was the view of ways and means that
 
05:38:57.470 --> 05:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
if the policy of New Hampshire
 
05:39:00.890 --> 05:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
is to end its Regional isolation
 
05:39:02.930 --> 05:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
and allow a nascent private Enterprise
 
05:39:07.490 --> 05:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:10.190 --> 05:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
then we should optimize the newborn
 
05:39:14.570 --> 05:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
economic sector's potential to succeed
 
05:39:17.208 --> 05:39:17.218 align:start position:0%
if our new state statute poses excessive
 
05:39:17.218 --> 05:39:18.770 align:start position:0%
if our new state statute poses excessive
barriers

05:39:18.770 --> 05:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
barriers
 
05:39:21.050 --> 05:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
we may be less likely to achieve
 
05:39:24.350 --> 05:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
important public policy purposes that
 
05:39:27.288 --> 05:39:27.298 align:start position:0%
include driving out the black market
 
05:39:30.350 --> 05:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
driving out adulterated product
 
05:39:32.750 --> 05:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
and raising new state funds that can be
 
05:39:35.810 --> 05:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
directed to important interests of the
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
state such as education funding
 
05:39:41.628 --> 05:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
unfunded retirement system liabilities
 
05:39:44.270 --> 05:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
and substance abuse problems
 
05:39:46.430 --> 05:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
with this philosophy in mind the
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee's amendment
 
05:39:49.788 --> 05:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
has improved
 
05:39:53.030 --> 05:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
the bill in four important ways
 
05:39:55.850 --> 05:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
we've reshaped it as an excise tax at
 
05:39:57.470 --> 05:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
the wholesale level
 
05:39:59.990 --> 05:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
set at 12 and a half percent
 
05:40:02.990 --> 05:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
deliberately intending
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
that all the aspects of different
 
05:40:09.350 --> 05:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
product are basically baked into the
 
05:40:14.150 --> 05:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
Brownie and they and they are taxed in
 
05:40:15.830 --> 05:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
the final form
 
05:40:18.770 --> 05:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
at a competitive rate that will help the
 
05:40:21.890 --> 05:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
business get established
 
05:40:24.230 --> 05:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
we changed the allocation of State funds
 
05:40:25.368 --> 05:40:25.378 align:start position:0%
from one
 
05:40:27.530 --> 05:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
that steered the funds almost entirely
 
05:40:30.470 --> 05:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
to the retirement liabilities
 
05:40:33.170 --> 05:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
and we reapportioned them so that 50
 
05:40:35.810 --> 05:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
percent will go to reduce the burden of
 
05:40:38.930 --> 05:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
the swept tax on real property
 
05:40:42.550 --> 05:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
30 percent to allay the unfunded
 
05:40:44.750 --> 05:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
retirement liabilities
 
05:40:47.030 --> 05:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
and the remaining 20 percent to targeted
 
05:40:50.030 --> 05:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
programs of safety agencies and the
 
05:40:53.090 --> 05:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:40:56.990 --> 05:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
we eliminated some exorbitant
 
05:41:00.650 --> 05:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
application and setup fees in order to
 
05:41:03.410 --> 05:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
remove barriers to entry
 
05:41:07.448 --> 05:41:07.458 align:start position:0%
and we reset the Appropriations so that
 
05:41:09.590 --> 05:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
as you would in a startup
 
05:41:09.600 --> 05:41:11.090 align:start position:0%

the estimates for tax revenues
 
05:41:27.470 --> 05:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
are that we're likely to see negligible
 
05:41:29.750 --> 05:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
amount in the first two years
 
05:41:32.628 --> 05:41:32.638 align:start position:0%

this is exactly the dramatic growth that
 
05:41:48.230 --> 05:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
we want to encourage and enable
 
05:41:50.208 --> 05:41:50.218 align:start position:0%
so Ways and Means has taken a very good
 
05:41:51.830 --> 05:41:51.840 align:start position:0%

05:46:05.330 --> 05:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr Speaker and honored
 
05:46:08.090 --> 05:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
colleagues I rise in opposition of the
 
05:46:10.190 --> 05:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
committee ought to pass
 
05:46:11.868 --> 05:46:11.878 align:start position:0%
for three reasons
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
05:46:16.430 --> 05:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
I understand the frustration that we
 
05:46:19.128 --> 05:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
have with our federal government
 
05:46:22.670 --> 05:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
and I understand the want of some for
 
05:46:25.548 --> 05:46:25.558 align:start position:0%
term limits and spending limits
 
05:46:28.610 --> 05:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
but I do not believe opening up our
 
05:46:31.850 --> 05:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
constitution is the way to resolve these
 
05:46:34.850 --> 05:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
problems there are other ways
 
05:46:34.860 --> 05:46:36.590 align:start position:0%
problems there are other ways
secondly

05:46:36.590 --> 05:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
05:46:40.010 --> 05:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
we don't have term limits ourselves and
 
05:46:42.590 --> 05:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
before we begin mandating them for
 
05:46:44.570 --> 05:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
others we should think about it for
 
05:46:47.090 --> 05:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
ourselves because quite frankly many of
 
05:46:49.910 --> 05:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
you in this room with whom I serve might
 
05:46:53.150 --> 05:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
not be here if we limited ourselves
 
05:46:53.160 --> 05:46:54.530 align:start position:0%
not be here if we limited ourselves
finally

05:46:54.530 --> 05:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
finally
 
05:46:58.070 --> 05:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
the voters hold the authority to limit
 
05:46:59.690 --> 05:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
our terms
 
05:47:02.208 --> 05:47:02.218 align:start position:0%
to vote on what is spent
 
05:47:04.788 --> 05:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
and we need to honor our Constitution
 
05:47:07.788 --> 05:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
and leave it alone
 
05:47:10.970 --> 05:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:16.310 --> 05:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:18.530 --> 05:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that's a yes I thank the
 
05:47:21.288 --> 05:47:21.298 align:start position:0%
member Fielding is it fair to say this
 
05:47:23.448 --> 05:47:23.458 align:start position:0%
is a very similar Bill to the other two
 
05:47:26.270 --> 05:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
Article 5 constitutional conventions
 
05:47:30.890 --> 05:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
yes it's very similar to many
 
05:47:35.868 --> 05:47:35.878 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention bills we have
 
05:47:39.410 --> 05:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
already defeated and no disrespect to
 
05:47:41.150 --> 05:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
those who worked hard on these bills
 
05:47:43.310 --> 05:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
this one is a little like putting the
 
05:47:46.730 --> 05:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
cart before the horse thank you
 
05:47:51.948 --> 05:47:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:54.590 --> 05:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
05:47:56.990 --> 05:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm afraid I think that the last
 
05:47:59.570 --> 05:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
statement here was incorrect so this
 
05:48:01.310 --> 05:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill came to us from the state and
 
05:48:03.770 --> 05:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
federal Relations Committee it
 
05:48:06.170 --> 05:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
previously was voted by everyone in this
 
05:48:09.590 --> 05:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
house on consent all we did in the
 
05:48:11.690 --> 05:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
finance committee was look at the dollar
 
05:48:15.288 --> 05:48:15.298 align:start position:0%
amounts in the bill it included a
 
05:48:17.750 --> 05:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar per diem for legislative
 
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
members participating in such
 
05:48:22.490 --> 05:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
conventions we decided that was
 
05:48:24.350 --> 05:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and we removed that that's
 
05:48:26.868 --> 05:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
what you just did with the amendment the
 
05:48:29.930 --> 05:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
bill itself is totally unlike the
 
05:48:32.448 --> 05:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
resolutions that were previously
 
05:48:36.070 --> 05:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
proposed to call for such a convention
 
05:48:40.788 --> 05:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
this bill only says what would happen
 
05:48:43.970 --> 05:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
uh if such a convention was called in
 
05:48:47.030 --> 05:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
the sense that who would go and how
 
05:48:49.070 --> 05:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
would they be chosen and things like
 
05:48:51.830 --> 05:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
that so this is prospective legislation
 
05:48:54.708 --> 05:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
that I don't think has much effect so
 
05:48:56.930 --> 05:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
passing it or not passing it probably
 
05:48:59.750 --> 05:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't make much of a difference but it
 
05:49:02.090 --> 05:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
is completely different from the
 
05:49:05.330 --> 05:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
previous such bills about Article 5
 
05:49:07.610 --> 05:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
conventions which were specifically
 
05:49:10.190 --> 05:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
calling for such conventions this has
 
05:49:13.250 --> 05:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with any particular
 
05:49:15.708 --> 05:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
you know the type of convention or
 
05:49:17.690 --> 05:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
content of convention or anything like
 
05:49:19.910 --> 05:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
that it's strictly about
 
05:49:23.150 --> 05:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
procedure who would go how would they be
 
05:49:25.430 --> 05:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
chosen that sort of thing thank you Mr
 
05:49:25.440 --> 05:49:26.448 align:start position:0%
chosen that sort of thing thank you Mr
Speaker

05:49:26.448 --> 05:49:26.458 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
05:49:28.250 --> 05:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
motion before us is ought to pass is
 
05:49:31.010 --> 05:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
amended on House Bill 269.
 
05:49:33.170 --> 05:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
05:49:35.750 --> 05:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
05:49:59.868 --> 05:49:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:00.890 --> 05:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:28.310 --> 05:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:30.110 --> 05:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
the motion before this ought to pass is
 
05:50:32.868 --> 05:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
amended on House Bill 269 this is a
 
05:50:35.570 --> 05:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
division vote
 
05:50:37.310 --> 05:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
which I recognizer representative Erin
 
05:50:41.690 --> 05:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:44.510 --> 05:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:50:46.430 --> 05:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
05:50:49.250 --> 05:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
if I know that this body recently
 
05:50:53.330 --> 05:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
rejected hcr1 and hcr4 the convention of
 
05:50:54.948 --> 05:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
states and term limits applications
 
05:50:58.128 --> 05:50:58.138 align:start position:0%
asking Congress to call a convention and
 
05:51:02.150 --> 05:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
if I also know that HB 269 is just
 
05:51:04.128 --> 05:51:04.138 align:start position:0%
another sales pitch for those rejected
 
05:51:06.890 --> 05:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
applications and if I further know Mr
 
05:51:09.288 --> 05:51:09.298 align:start position:0%
Speaker that delegate bills have nothing
 
05:51:11.150 --> 05:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
to do with selecting and controlling
 
05:51:13.970 --> 05:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
delegates to an article 5 convention and
 
05:51:16.670 --> 05:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
everything to do with securing votes on
 
05:51:20.628 --> 05:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
those applications and lastly Mr Speaker
 
05:51:24.350 --> 05:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
if I know that convention delegates as
 
05:51:26.990 --> 05:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
Sovereign representatives of the people
 
05:51:29.930 --> 05:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
have the inherent right to alter or to
 
05:51:32.270 --> 05:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
abolish our form of government or write
 
05:51:34.430 --> 05:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
a new constitution as expressed by the
 
05:51:36.288 --> 05:51:36.298 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence paragraph
 
05:51:39.230 --> 05:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
two and that they have more power than
 
05:51:41.690 --> 05:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
State legislatures and Congress combined
 
05:51:44.690 --> 05:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
making it such that no one or no one
 
05:51:47.750 --> 05:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
legislative bill or state law has power
 
05:51:50.090 --> 05:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
over the delegates making delegate bills
 
05:51:52.670 --> 05:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
like this useless for their stated
 
05:51:56.208 --> 05:51:56.218 align:start position:0%
purpose would I then Mr Speaker press
 
05:51:59.270 --> 05:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
the red button to vote to overturn the
 
05:52:01.850 --> 05:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
OTP motion and keep these Article 5
 
05:52:04.310 --> 05:52:04.320 align:start position:0%

05:52:06.770 --> 05:52:06.780 align:start position:0%

05:52:08.628 --> 05:52:08.638 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
05:52:22.430 --> 05:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
know that this is simply prospective
 
05:52:25.190 --> 05:52:25.200 align:start position:0%

05:58:34.430 --> 05:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
I learned of something that was going on
 
05:58:37.970 --> 05:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
in downtown Manchester that was captured
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
by WMUR this past weekend as well and it
 
05:58:43.190 --> 05:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
has to do with something called Missy's
 
05:58:43.200 --> 05:58:44.810 align:start position:0%
has to do with something called Missy's
closet

05:58:44.810 --> 05:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
closet
 
05:58:46.670 --> 05:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know the owners I have no
 
05:58:48.288 --> 05:58:48.298 align:start position:0%
personal connection to them but I think
 
05:58:50.150 --> 05:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
their vision is awesome
 
05:58:53.208 --> 05:58:53.218 align:start position:0%
they allow people to effectively borrow
 
05:58:53.218 --> 05:58:54.230 align:start position:0%
they allow people to effectively borrow
out

05:58:54.230 --> 05:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:58:56.868 --> 05:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
dresses for the proms to save people
 
05:58:56.878 --> 05:58:58.010 align:start position:0%
dresses for the proms to save people
money

05:58:58.010 --> 05:58:58.020 align:start position:0%

open each weekend you can find out
 
05:59:11.330 --> 05:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
information online but it's a great idea
 
05:59:13.010 --> 05:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
to help families who can't afford
 
05:59:15.708 --> 05:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
dresses and whose daughters might want
 
05:59:18.410 --> 05:59:18.420 align:start position:0%

we'll wait till next year for that event
 
05:59:50.270 --> 05:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
but even more exciting is that it is not
 
05:59:53.390 --> 05:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
even 3 30 yet so we might actually beat
 
05:59:57.010 --> 05:59:57.020 align:start position:0%
the Senate to the auto dealers annual
 
05:59:59.868 --> 05:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
event in which they invite us this is a
 
06:00:02.750 --> 06:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
very unusual that we get out so early so
 
06:00:05.448 --> 06:00:05.458 align:start position:0%
don't want to miss this uh you might
 
06:00:07.250 --> 06:00:07.260 align:start position:0%

06:01:04.910 --> 06:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
is Nikki McCarter and I'm from Belknap
 
06:01:07.970 --> 06:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
County in Belmont and I'm an alcoholic
 
06:01:10.128 --> 06:01:10.138 align:start position:0%
I have been one for nearly all of my
 
06:01:12.890 --> 06:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
adult life with sporadic periods of
 
06:01:12.900 --> 06:01:14.150 align:start position:0%
adult life with sporadic periods of
sobriety

06:01:14.150 --> 06:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
sobriety
 
06:01:15.770 --> 06:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
when I thought about running for office
 
06:01:17.628 --> 06:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
I wanted to bring a conservative voice
 
06:01:19.910 --> 06:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
to Concord to represent the constituents
 
06:01:21.410 --> 06:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
in District 8.
 
06:01:23.990 --> 06:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
I asked myself lots of questions
 
06:01:26.570 --> 06:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
how can I make this work with my job my
 
06:01:29.350 --> 06:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
family my dogs whatever
 
06:01:32.510 --> 06:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
you all have the same things to juggle
 
06:01:34.548 --> 06:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
the most important perhaps the only
 
06:01:36.530 --> 06:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
question I should have asked myself was
 
06:01:39.830 --> 06:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
how will this affect my sobriety
 
06:01:41.628 --> 06:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
well it did
 
06:01:44.030 --> 06:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
and it was a big fail
 
06:01:46.070 --> 06:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago I acknowledged the very
 
06:01:48.410 --> 06:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
familiar unforgiving stormy sea I was
 
06:01:49.730 --> 06:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
swimming in again
 
06:01:51.708 --> 06:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
I reached out for help and was admitted
 
06:01:54.288 --> 06:01:54.298 align:start position:0%
to Liberty Health Services in Derry
 
06:01:56.930 --> 06:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
the staff were very kind competent and
 
06:01:56.940 --> 06:01:58.070 align:start position:0%
the staff were very kind competent and
efficient

06:01:58.070 --> 06:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
06:01:59.990 --> 06:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
I left there with a toolbox full of
 
06:02:02.510 --> 06:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
tools and A Renewed confidence to do the
 
06:02:04.970 --> 06:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
job I was elected to do
 
06:02:07.070 --> 06:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
I want to express my sincere apologies
 
06:02:08.868 --> 06:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
for missing many important pieces of
 
06:02:12.350 --> 06:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
legislation especially HB 10. I've heard
 
06:02:15.048 --> 06:02:15.058 align:start position:0%
a lot about that from my constituents
 
06:02:17.208 --> 06:02:17.218 align:start position:0%
the words of encouragement and prayers
 
06:02:19.190 --> 06:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
meant a lot so thank you to those who
 
06:02:20.390 --> 06:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
reached out
 
06:02:22.190 --> 06:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
to me
 
06:02:24.770 --> 06:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
gratitude is difficult to maintain when
 
06:02:27.170 --> 06:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
your life feels full of troubles
 
06:02:30.470 --> 06:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
I now look every day and find some and
 
06:02:32.030 --> 06:02:32.040 align:start position:0%

06:02:32.040 --> 06:02:33.470 align:start position:0%
I'm grateful to be here with all of you
today

06:02:33.470 --> 06:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:02:35.330 --> 06:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
in closing I'd like to share a little
 
06:02:38.030 --> 06:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
story about gratitude
 
06:02:40.070 --> 06:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
a blind boy sat on the steps of a
 
06:02:42.288 --> 06:02:42.298 align:start position:0%
building with a hat by his feet
 
06:02:44.868 --> 06:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
he held up a sign which read I am blind
 
06:02:46.910 --> 06:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
please help
 
06:02:48.708 --> 06:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
there were only a few coins in the Hat
 
06:02:50.868 --> 06:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
spare change from folks as they hard
 
06:02:50.878 --> 06:02:52.310 align:start position:0%
spare change from folks as they hard
passed

06:02:52.310 --> 06:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
passed
 
06:02:54.288 --> 06:02:54.298 align:start position:0%
a man was walking by
 
06:02:56.150 --> 06:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
he took a few coins from his pocket
 
06:02:58.430 --> 06:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
dropped them in the Hat he then took the
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
sign he turned it over and wrote some
 
06:03:03.590 --> 06:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
words put it back in the boy's hand and
 
06:03:04.730 --> 06:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
walked away
 
06:03:06.650 --> 06:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
that way everyone who walked by would
 
06:03:08.690 --> 06:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
see the new words
 
06:03:11.208 --> 06:03:11.218 align:start position:0%
soon the Hat began to fill up
 
06:03:12.948 --> 06:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
a lot more people were giving money to
 
06:03:14.510 --> 06:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
the blind boy
 
06:03:16.610 --> 06:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
that afternoon the man returned to see
 
06:03:18.230 --> 06:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
how things were going
 
06:03:20.150 --> 06:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
the little boy recognized the footsteps
 
06:03:21.948 --> 06:03:21.958 align:start position:0%
and asked were you the one who changed
 
06:03:24.830 --> 06:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
my sign this morning what does it say
 
06:03:27.830 --> 06:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
the man said I only wrote the truth I
 
06:03:29.690 --> 06:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
said what you said just in a different
 
06:03:29.700 --> 06:03:30.708 align:start position:0%
said what you said just in a different
way

06:03:30.708 --> 06:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:03:34.430 --> 06:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
I wrote today is a beautiful day but I
 
06:03:36.410 --> 06:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
cannot see it
 
06:03:38.930 --> 06:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
both signs spoke the truth the first
 
06:03:41.390 --> 06:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
simply said the boy was blind the second
 
06:03:43.490 --> 06:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
conveyed to everyone walking by how
 
06:03:45.708 --> 06:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
grateful they should be
 
06:03:47.930 --> 06:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
I'm very grateful to be here today and I
 
06:03:49.070 --> 06:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
see a lot of things that I've been
 
06:03:50.930 --> 06:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
ignoring for a long time
 
06:03:53.270 --> 06:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
so if you or someone you know is
 
06:03:54.948 --> 06:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
struggling with any kind of an addiction
 
06:03:57.708 --> 06:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of help out there you can
 
06:04:00.288 --> 06:04:00.298 align:start position:0%
start simply by dialing 2-1-1 which is
 
06:04:01.670 --> 06:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
what I did
 
06:04:04.330 --> 06:04:04.340 align:start position:0%
asking for and accepting help is amazing

06:04:48.170 --> 06:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
do you recognizes representative Heath

06:04:57.048 --> 06:04:57.058 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker and honorable Representatives
 
06:04:58.910 --> 06:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
I understand it we have had a long day
 
06:05:00.590 --> 06:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
so I will be brief
 
06:05:02.690 --> 06:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are unaware the
 
06:05:04.850 --> 06:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
restrict act or United States Senate
 
06:05:07.128 --> 06:05:07.138 align:start position:0%
Bill 686 is legislation that goes
 
06:05:09.110 --> 06:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
against New Hampshire's ideals and
 
06:05:11.990 --> 06:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
violates the first and Fourth Amendment
 
06:05:13.910 --> 06:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
the bill is focused on tackling the
 
06:05:16.548 --> 06:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
issue of data theft which is a problem
 
06:05:19.010 --> 06:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
but this legislation would punish the
 
06:05:21.590 --> 06:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
individual user instead of punishing the
 
06:05:21.600 --> 06:05:24.048 align:start position:0%
individual user instead of punishing the
perpetrator

06:05:24.048 --> 06:05:24.058 align:start position:0%
perpetrator
 
06:05:27.530 --> 06:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
this is not Justice and it would not it
 
06:05:30.048 --> 06:05:30.058 align:start position:0%
would only serve authoritarian purposes
 
06:05:32.208 --> 06:05:32.218 align:start position:0%
Banning people from accessing or
 
06:05:34.010 --> 06:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
attempting to access data originating
 
06:05:35.930 --> 06:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
from another country
 
06:05:39.110 --> 06:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
no matter what country that is it does
 
06:05:41.090 --> 06:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
not necessarily mean that it is done so
 
06:05:41.100 --> 06:05:42.650 align:start position:0%
not necessarily mean that it is done so
maliciously

06:05:42.650 --> 06:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
maliciously
 
06:05:44.868 --> 06:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
the bill fails to provide any sort of
 
06:05:47.390 --> 06:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
national security or privacy protection
 
06:05:49.430 --> 06:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
and does not establish any sort of data
 
06:05:49.440 --> 06:05:50.448 align:start position:0%
and does not establish any sort of data
right

06:05:50.448 --> 06:05:50.458 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:05:52.368 --> 06:05:52.378 align:start position:0%
instead the Secretary of Commerce would
 
06:05:54.230 --> 06:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
be able to regulate apps like websites
 
06:05:57.230 --> 06:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
vpns and entire companies just to name a
 
06:05:57.240 --> 06:05:57.948 align:start position:0%
vpns and entire companies just to name a
few

06:05:57.948 --> 06:05:57.958 align:start position:0%
few
 
06:06:00.410 --> 06:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
all in closed door meetings with limited
 
06:06:02.570 --> 06:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
input from the people
 
06:06:04.430 --> 06:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
Hardware like certain brands of cell
 
06:06:06.650 --> 06:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
phones or computers would become illegal
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
and software that people use every day
 
06:06:11.990 --> 06:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
would become a felonious Act
 
06:06:14.090 --> 06:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
for example I'm talking about Lenovo
 
06:06:17.030 --> 06:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
laptops and acts in apps like expressvpn
 
06:06:19.730 --> 06:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
which would be doubly illegal because it
 
06:06:22.548 --> 06:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
would allow you to bypass the ban
 
06:06:24.410 --> 06:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
these are everyday products that you
 
06:06:26.230 --> 06:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
would not think about twice
 
06:06:28.850 --> 06:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
and would continue to use if they were
 
06:06:32.930 --> 06:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:35.510 --> 06:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement of this policy would allow
 
06:06:38.750 --> 06:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
officers to inspect search detain seize
 
06:06:41.570 --> 06:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
or impose temporary denial orders with
 
06:06:43.850 --> 06:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
respect to items in any form or
 
06:06:46.070 --> 06:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
conveyances on which it is believed
 
06:06:48.890 --> 06:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
their items to have been
 
06:06:52.128 --> 06:06:52.138 align:start position:0%
our being or are imported to into the
 
06:06:53.930 --> 06:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
United States in violation of this act
 
06:06:56.448 --> 06:06:56.458 align:start position:0%
or any other applicable federal law
 
06:06:58.490 --> 06:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
this is an obvious trampling of our
 
06:07:01.548 --> 06:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment right with under uh the
 
06:07:03.350 --> 06:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
claim that it is necessary for National
 
06:07:03.360 --> 06:07:04.788 align:start position:0%
claim that it is necessary for National
Security

06:07:04.788 --> 06:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
Security
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
the ACLU has voiced its concern over the
 
06:07:09.048 --> 06:07:09.058 align:start position:0%
First Amendment problems with
 
06:07:11.150 --> 06:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
implementing this legislation and how
 
06:07:13.670 --> 06:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
bending apps could silence the public
 
06:07:16.310 --> 06:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
because quote if the secretary uses this
 
06:07:18.470 --> 06:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
newfound power to ban apps like Tick
 
06:07:20.750 --> 06:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
tobs Tick Tock or other communication
 
06:07:23.090 --> 06:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
platforms without evidence of
 
06:07:25.128 --> 06:07:25.138 align:start position:0%
overwhelming or imminent harm it would
 
06:07:27.770 --> 06:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
violate the freedom of expression
 
06:07:29.868 --> 06:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
I hope you will join me in contacting
 
06:07:32.150 --> 06:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
Senator Shaheen and Senator Hassan and
 
06:07:33.948 --> 06:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
voicing your concern over this dangerous
 
06:07:46.548 --> 06:07:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:49.670 --> 06:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
before we read the final motion
 
06:07:51.948 --> 06:07:51.958 align:start position:0%
I just want to say how proud I am of
 
06:07:53.030 --> 06:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
this body
 
06:07:55.490 --> 06:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
nobody can remember the last time that
 
06:07:58.368 --> 06:07:58.378 align:start position:0%
we passed the budget bipartisan as we
 
06:08:01.010 --> 06:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
have today and I think you all deserve
 
06:08:02.868 --> 06:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
one hell of a
 
06:08:07.750 --> 06:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:11.800 --> 06:08:11.810 align:start position:0%
