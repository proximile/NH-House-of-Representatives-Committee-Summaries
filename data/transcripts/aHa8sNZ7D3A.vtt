00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.950 align:start position:0%
I think that
testimony

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.090 align:start position:0%
testimony
child

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the Lost Space by charts
 
00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:31.460 align:start position:0%
are 3.6 million dollars
 
00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:36.539 align:start position:0%
they get no additional funding for use
 
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
for yeast or mental of space
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
and I think that this bill provides an
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:53.780 align:start position:0%
still in space
 
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's really using
 
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
space that has been built for public
 
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759 align:start position:0%
education and charter schools are
 
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
important schools so I think it's
 
00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:09.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
of legislation thank you thank you very
 
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair Mr chair
 
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
I I'm having a hard time here uh
 
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:20.180 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli it's very um
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
and not very clear and I don't know if
 
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
it's my age or just that that's what's
 
00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
happening oh it's the microphone if he
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
can use a microphone that would be great
 
00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:30.539 align:start position:0%
thank you everything was inaudible Mr
 
00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:32.889 align:start position:0%
thank you everything was inaudible Mr
chair

00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:32.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
listen now see if that's any better is
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
this any better yes yes yes thank you
 
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:49.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
uh the only thing I was saying Mr
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
chairman is that uh one of the concerns
 
00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
about this was what if a Walmart or some
 
00:08:59.570 --> 00:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
entity he had a lot of money he wanted
 
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
to make the first offer and the answer
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
to that simply is that uh the charter
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
school would have a chance to nasty
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
offer if they put not in the district
 
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
could sell to the uh whoever bought for
 
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
them the most money so the right first
 
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:18.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
represent Allison
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh I have uh two
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
school districts in my legislative
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
district Concord and Merrimack Valley
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
and in the past few years we've gone
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
through this whole issue of schools
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
which become available because of new
 
00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
construction and I I think it's useful
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
for the committee just to hear where
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
four of these went uh one of them uh one
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
of the elementary schools became a
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
community center with rooms for senior
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
citizens uh the branch library uh an
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
auditorium another one of the schools
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
was sold to a private organization the
 
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
Communications Group which then put that
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
particular building back on the tax
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
rolls and contributed money to the
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
school system a third one was the smalls
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
Elementary School which became the
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
school's central office and the fourth
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
one which is in Penacook became the CSI
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
charter school which is a
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
competency-based uh charter school that
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
serves students not only from the
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Valley District book for
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
surrounding districts uh this bill with
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
its right of first refusal
 
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh would could cause issues with any
 
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
school district or municipality that it
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
buildings that weren't uh weren't uh
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
needed anymore I I guess I would raise
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
the issue for instance uh in any one of
 
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
the four examples that I use to you uh
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
let's assume uh Charter School from
 
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
Laconia wanted to open a branch in
 
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
Concord uh they could have filed on any
 
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
one of these four cases
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
the writer first refusal and
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
theoretically kept the city of Concord
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
or pentacook from using their buildings
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
in a way that they saw fit I see this
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
bill is is the exact opposite of local
 
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
control we talk a lot in this committee
 
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
about local control and how important
 
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
that is uh
 
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
under this bill we would be having the
 
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
state tell local municipalities how to
 
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
utilize their own property that is the
 
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
exact opposite of local control uh and I
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
will be voting against the motion thank
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for further
 
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you Mr chairman do we have
 
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.310 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you Mr chairman do we have
any

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
um data on problems with this uh in
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
school districts for charter schools
 
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
have sought uh to use uh unused space
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
hey that question can you open up yeah
 
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
just to anyone I I don't have an answer
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking the question
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
is there anybody that might have
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
something that's I see a representative
 
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
it's not like it's your hand and stuff
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
yes I have been told that a charter
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
school in Manchester has
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
um repeatedly tried to leave space from
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh Manchester and Manchester currently
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
has four schools that are supposed to be
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
closed and they have been trying for
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Manchester doesn't have any
 
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
schools that are close
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
we need to ask uh sorry I'm sorry I'm
 
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:49.100 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
I do have something to add to the
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
discussion no it's just that there are
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
no schools in Manchester that are closed
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
and empty at this time
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know where that information
 
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
is representative Shaw
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
um yes I agree with uh representative
 
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.550 align:start position:0%
um yes I agree with uh representative
Cornell

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
Cornell
 
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
um with all the respect uh I think there
 
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
is a a charter school that might be
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
interested in one of the schools that is
 
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
about to be closed if it gets closed it
 
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
hasn't been finalized yet uh but
 
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
um I do not believe that there has ever
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
been an issue in Manchester that I know
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
of and sitting on the
 
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
um Alderman board uh that would come
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
before us and I'm chairman of lands of
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
buildings and I have never heard of that
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
issue uh arising in Manchester and I
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
think that um I agree with the
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison uh I think they
 
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
have a fair right to
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
um to apply uh for these schools and
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
they've been granted there is at least
 
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
one in Manchester that's in a
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
former school facility it's I mean a
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
former facility it's not a school but
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
it's a a an unused City facility so I I
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
really don't think that I I agree that
 
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
that it should be the local districts
 
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.449 align:start position:0%
that it should be the local districts
that

00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
um will uh identify uh what they're
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
going to do with these buildings and and
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's usually a cordial uh reception for
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
uh Charter Schools when they're looking
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%

that I think were not answered in the
 
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.449 align:start position:0%
that I think were not answered in the
hearing

00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%

instruction that was never really
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
defined what that would mean and I
 
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
recall posing the question if the school
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
district owns an SAU building which is a
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
school-owned bill a district-owned
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
building but there is no instruction
 
00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
engaging occurring there is that subject
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
um I also recall that I believe it was
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
Carl Ladd at one point pointed out on
 
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:21.500 align:start position:0%
page two lines 22 24
 
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
during the terms of Elise chartered
 
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
Public Schools shall be responsible for
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
direct expenses
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
Etc but the question was if the district
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
has taken out a bond for example to
 
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
improve the HVAC system uh does the
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
charter school bear any portion of that
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
cost once um once it is uh in in the
 
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
inside of the building uh so you know
 
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
there are questions here that still
 
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.449 align:start position:0%
there are questions here that still
remain

00:15:46.449 --> 00:15:46.459 align:start position:0%
remain
 
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that we are mandating
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
something which districts can already do
 
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
and have done there has been no evidence
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
presented here today or in the prior
 
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.970 align:start position:0%
presented here today or in the prior
hearing

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:00.980 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
of actual problems with the current
 
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
system as it operates and this
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
contradicts uh the Mantra that we hear
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
of local control so for all of those
 
00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:14.579 align:start position:0%
reasons uh I certainly will oppose this
 
00:16:16.689 --> 00:16:16.699 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
representative uh like us you have
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
yes I I wasn't saying that there were
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
schools currently open in Manchester I
 
00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
had said that there were four that we
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
were talking about
 
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
but the person who told me that there
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
was an issue was actually somebody
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
somebody Associated I don't remember
 
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
whether he said he was on the board or
 
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
whatever of a charter school and because
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester had some space they had been
 
00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:50.579 align:start position:0%
he said over the last few years trying
 
00:16:53.689 --> 00:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
to lease some space in those classrooms
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
and so anyway just wanted to make clear
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to say
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Bob representative Ellison did
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up again oh I'm sorry
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman hey representative
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair I wanted to
 
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:12.380 align:start position:0%
go back to the um the um you know
 
00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the the fact that
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester hasn't hasn't um closed any
 
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
of their school buildings but I wanted
 
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
to go back to representative Lee kisses
 
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
hypothetical so I'm just wondering how
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
how 278 should should the school
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
district not wish to um to sell a school
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
building how 278 would address the
 
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that I mean if they
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to sell the building they
 
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
don't want to sell the building but my
 
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there were for the
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the latest study was
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
that there would be four buildings that
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
they should be closing and that would
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
give and and that would give the
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for um
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
that Charter School
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
to get that space But I was only
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
saying anything because somebody said
 
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
have there been problems in the past so
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's what
 
00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but but looking at page one
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
line 17 through 20. it's only if the
 
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
school district school district school
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
board extends an offer for a purchase or
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
lease to um to a party other than the
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
other than the chartered school so if
 
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
they're not interested in
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
selling or leasing the space I don't
 
00:18:42.409 --> 00:18:42.419 align:start position:0%
think 278 compels the school board to um
 
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
to necessarily uh sell or lease the
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
space to anybody
 
00:18:50.409 --> 00:18:50.419 align:start position:0%
including a chartered school
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering how this fixed the
 
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
problem that you're talking about
 
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
so I didn't think they were just going
 
00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
to leave the building after
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
empty further further comments
 
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.390 align:start position:0%
empty further further comments
representative

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
thank you um I was just I had a question
 
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
too and maybe representative Shaw since
 
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
she deals with this a lot
 
00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
um I was surprised in this bill how it
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
how it um
 
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
not only took away local control to to
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
the extent of uh who got the building or
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
who got first refusal on the building
 
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
but also how it delineated uh parts of
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
the lease and um I'm just wondering if
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's a common practice when
 
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
public buildings are uh leased or sold
 
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.669 align:start position:0%
public buildings are uh leased or sold
that

00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:35.450 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
something like this in law says what
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
they have to do as far as the lease is
 
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.029 align:start position:0%
they have to do as far as the lease is
concerned

00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
the microphone please microphone please
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
I can't hear you again
 
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.250 align:start position:0%
I can't hear you again
um

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
that it says in the right of first
 
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.650 align:start position:0%
that it says in the right of first
refusalem

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
refusalem
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
it shall be the option offering School
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
District whether to sell at least the
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
properties under consideration at fair
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
market value for a term to be agreed
 
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
upon by Apartments so I I differ as to
 
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
whether there is local control in this
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
legislation or not
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
what what lines were you referring to
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
engage two uh the middle of the page
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'm 13 14 15. Mr chair
 
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
I was um uh speaking to the you know the
 
00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
the different
 
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
um areas in this bill and I I don't have
 
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
a copy with numbers on it so
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
um but uh section four you know where
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
where it actually talks about the lease
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
itself and then again
 
00:20:59.930 --> 00:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
in section six
 
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.789 align:start position:0%
in section six
um

00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh five and six where it's talking about
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
different things that have to occur
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
within the lease if it if uh the charter
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
school does lease the building and I'm
 
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
just wondering I I have no idea I'm a
 
00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:15.059 align:start position:0%
former teacher so I didn't get involved
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
in this so I'm just wondering if that's
 
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
common practice to have those kinds of
 
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
pick that question or
 
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
well well sure I mean I don't think this
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
is exactly what what representative
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
Tanner was talking about but but you
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
know I think rights of first refusal are
 
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
you know commonly
 
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
um you know attractive Provisions when
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
you've already got a lease agreement so
 
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
that if the if the landlord I'm talking
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
about a commercial lease when the If a
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
landlord wants to sell the business or
 
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm sorry the building that
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the the the the the the
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
um uh the company that's leasing the
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
space has a um has a right of first
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
refusal so that if they wanted to remain
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
there they'd they'd have some some
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
assurances of that you know aside from
 
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.250 align:start position:0%
assurances of that you know aside from
that

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
um the value of a right of first refusal
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure we heard from any
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
Realtors on this but the value of a
 
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
writer first refuse refusal does not
 
00:22:24.649 --> 00:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
accrue to the building owner in fact it
 
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
detracts from the value of the property
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
because it makes it um it makes it less
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know less interesting for for a
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
third party to um to want to want to
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
negotiate so given the fact that you
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
know these are political subdivisions
 
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
who we represent implementing a law like
 
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
this really only subtracts value from
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
from our constituents and from our
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
school from school districts who our
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
constituents have invested uh tax money
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
in so I
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
um you know under any case they'd
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
certainly have a um you know uh uh
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
there'd be an opportunity if if a school
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
building was being put on the market for
 
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
a chartered public school to uh to put
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
an offer in I don't think they need to
 
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
write a refer first refusal to do that
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
which is which is just going to take
 
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
away value from our taxpayers
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair for for letting me
 
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
speak uh there's also the issue um
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative luno that sometimes
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
I apologize for the commentary
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
um if the if the property is not put on
 
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
the market and there's a private
 
00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:39.299 align:start position:0%
agreement to negotiate it then that
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the ability for a
 
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
chartered school or or um to make an
 
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
offer on the property so we need to look
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
at that transparency as well if the if
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
the towns might be making a private
 
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
private agreement I'm not sure that's
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's allowed under New Hampshire law
 
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
but I think that's a good good question
 
00:23:59.810 --> 00:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
to look into
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
my understanding school boards have to
 
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
do things in public at least for my 12
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
years on the board we did
 
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
um we used to talk to Dairy then well
 
00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:11.900 align:start position:0%
well then there their problem
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
hey representative
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
yes I and I'm not sure I want to get
 
00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
back to Manchester and I'm not sure if
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
this is right and representative Shaw
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
would know I think more than I do but I
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
think if the school district doesn't use
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
the school building the district does
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
not have ownership of the building it
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
refer reverts back to the city of
 
00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.430 align:start position:0%
refer reverts back to the city of
Manchester

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
um I think Manchester
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
Municipal owns the buildings so once
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
they become empty and the school
 
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
district's not using them anymore it's
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
up to the city of Manchester what to do
 
00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:48.059 align:start position:0%
with them am I is that wrong you're
 
00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:49.610 align:start position:0%
with them am I is that wrong you're
correct

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
so so this wouldn't apply to Manchester
 
00:24:54.649 --> 00:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
at all because school district would
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
have no say over what happens to the
 
00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.770 align:start position:0%
have no say over what happens to the
buildings

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.169 align:start position:0%
buildings
right

00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
further further comments
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
a note on
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
that I wrote in here that there was an
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
amendment coming to deal with a
 
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.390 align:start position:0%
amendment coming to deal with a
miswording

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
miswording
 
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.010 align:start position:0%
miswording
and

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.630 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:21.299 align:start position:0%
we're talking we just had an otpa motion
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
and not a I mean an OTP not
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
otpa and I'm wondering about the
 
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
which we didn't have it was supposed to
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
be coming and it was supposed to deal
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
with um
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
second page line 12 and shall not be
 
00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.059 align:start position:0%
subject to RSA 91a and that kind of
 
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't the right
 
00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.430 align:start position:0%
it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't the right
wording

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
wording
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
I do have that note on mine I made also
 
00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
only I had page two line 11.
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh but it's the same area you're talking
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
about well yeah it was it was the end of
 
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
I I've not seen that
 
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:33.830 align:start position:0%
I I've not seen that
no

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:38.900 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh just a general
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
question following up on on
 
00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell's comment uh
 
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
granted this if approved this would be a
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh legislative action uh has
 
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
there any research or background effort
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
been put in to see how many other cities
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
and towns would be in the same situation
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
as Manchester and that this law would
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.970 align:start position:0%
 
eign

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.909 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.919 --> 00:27:25.370 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:33.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
or anyone I mean it doesn't matter I
 
00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:37.940 align:start position:0%
just asked that question
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
and nobody has volunteered I'm I'm here
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
if someone needs to speak with me
 
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.250 align:start position:0%
if someone needs to speak with me
good

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:48.260 align:start position:0%
ask your question uh representative
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh representative
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you for taking the question
 
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
um it came up that Manchester is one of
 
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
the communities in the state that this
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill would not uh be relevant to because
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
they have their own uh requirements that
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
school buildings go back to the
 
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
municipality and my question was has
 
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
there any been any effort to do any
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
research at all to check how many other
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
cities are talents and municipalities in
 
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
the state would be in the same situation
 
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
with this wall and not be applicable
 
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
um the only thing I can tell you is uh
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
this bill was heard in the Senate uh
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
not last term I think the term before
 
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.390 align:start position:0%
not last term I think the term before
and

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
um and Senator Waters asked about
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
Manchester and
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
um and the represent and the senator
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
from Manchester
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
um at the time
 
00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh said that that would that was
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
something that they were looking into
 
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
with their legal department
 
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
um but it was not no answer ever came
 
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
back uh from anyone and and to my
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
knowledge no one has ever gone and
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
looked at other
 
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
um cities or towns uh or uh and ask that
 
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
same question whether there is a
 
00:29:06.649 --> 00:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
provision in their in their rules if it

bill relative to the private rights of

uh uh any comments
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
um yes I do thank you Mr chair
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
right now willing is an issue that's
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
taken seriously in our schools however
 
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
there are occasions where parents are
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
not appropriately notified or it is not
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
appropriately managed
 
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
by having a right of private action this
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
gives further encouragement for the
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
schools to handle these issues
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
appropriately and it gives them a good a
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
strong motivation to make sure that
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
parents are well communicated with this
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
is something that can have the lives of
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
our children at risk if they are not do
 
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
not have bullying appropriately
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
addressed and I believe that this is
 
00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:24.299 align:start position:0%
something that will provide protection
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
to our students through this threat of
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
potential legal action and I know
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
through a personal experience that
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
lawyers are unlikely to take a case if
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
they do not believe that the content is
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
strong so I do not expect that there
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
would be any misuse of this because it's
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
a high burden of proof however there are
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
occasions where this is sorely needed
 
00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
and children have died because of the
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
lack of transparency on bullying thank
 
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much represent Leon
 
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:02.220 align:start position:0%

rep sound Bruno thank you very much Mr
 
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.870 align:start position:0%
rep sound Bruno thank you very much Mr
chair

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
um I was just wondering if the language
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
in this bill particularly on page five
 
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
when it refers to school district to
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
chartered Public Schools is Broad enough
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
to apply to any approved school and I
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
was wondering if maybe
 
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419 align:start position:0%
um I see we've got Marissa Chase here
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
that she might be able to comment on um
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
on the uh the the the
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
um a bit I guess availability as it as
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
it relates to uh these sorts of uh right
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
well I've got I've got the four week old
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
fear right now how many other people
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
have communications first or discussion
 
00:34:52.329 --> 00:34:52.339 align:start position:0%
points uh if we're going to have a
 
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
technician offer some input maybe we
 
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
ought to have all that you know put out
 
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:20.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
earlier this week from a parent whose
 
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
daughter was in the hospital after a
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
suicide attempt
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
the parent relayed the message that she
 
00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
had been spent more than a year fighting
 
00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:38.339 align:start position:0%
to have her daughter protected from her
 
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
abusers but recently one of the bullies
 
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.950 align:start position:0%
abusers but recently one of the bullies
had

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
um as the parents hit it up their game
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
and the daughter had become overwhelmed
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
and depressed and uh this ended with a
 
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
suicide attempt and the daughter is in
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.510 align:start position:0%
the hospital
um

00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
it's it's time to do something
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
um it is incumbent on the legislature we
 
00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:08.099 align:start position:0%
are charged
 
00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:10.940 align:start position:0%
um in the statute with protecting
 
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
students from bullying and cyber
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
bullying it is our job to do this and
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's time we pass this and give some uh
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
recourse to parents in these situations
 
00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:27.140 align:start position:0%

here
 
00:36:35.089 --> 00:36:35.099 align:start position:0%
the current law which this repeals and
 
00:36:35.099 --> 00:36:36.230 align:start position:0%
the current law which this repeals and
replaces

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
replaces
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
says that the private right of action is
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
not permitted
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
so parents or others cannot take action
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
against the school no matter what they
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
do in this situation
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple of points one is that
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
I don't feel that we ever adequately uh
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
uh addressed the definition of the word
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
aggrieved and how that could be applied
 
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.210 align:start position:0%
aggrieved and how that could be applied
to

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:16.220 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
identifying behaviors that were
 
00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
causing concern or distress within the
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
school district and uh the second point
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
that I would like to make is that
 
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
um I certainly as a school counselor
 
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
dealt with a tremendous number of uh
 
00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:38.099 align:start position:0%
parent concerns
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
some of them uh including bullying
 
00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:42.410 align:start position:0%
some of them uh including bullying
concerns

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to figure out is
 
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
how the legal action of uh family a
 
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
is going to directly impact or change
 
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:00.020 align:start position:0%
the behavior of a group of let's say
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
hypothetically seventh grade boys in the
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
cafeteria that are somehow or another
 
00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:11.099 align:start position:0%
bullying verbally a kid at a table I I
 
00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:14.099 align:start position:0%
would like to suggest that perhaps
 
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
funding would be better spent rather
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
than in litigation that it would be
 
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
better spent putting Personnel into our
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
schools that could actually provide
 
00:38:27.849 --> 00:38:27.859 align:start position:0%
direct support and instruction in
 
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
anti-bullying because I just don't see
 
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
how a law case in Pembroke is going to
 
00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
change the behavior of a school child in
 
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.810 align:start position:0%
change the behavior of a school child in
Temple

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:44.339 align:start position:0%
represent Leon
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much this this private
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
right of action goes to the schools and
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
those who are charged with protecting
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
our students and our children this is
 
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:56.220 align:start position:0%
when they the few times but they do
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
happen when they drop the ball and they
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
do not appropriately find alternatives
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
for these students whether that is
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
something where they can have
 
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
um have an education outside of the
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
school to get away from their bullies or
 
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
addressing the bullying and the bullying
 
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
that is happening in the schools the
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
assaults that are happening in the
 
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
schools and the students are sometimes
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
not protected it is rare that we have
 
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
these cases where students are
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
hospitalized either from their injuries
 
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:23.780 align:start position:0%
or from suicide attempts but it happens
 
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
this is something that is upon the
 
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
administrators it is upon those who work
 
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
in the schools who should be protecting
 
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
our students and it is for those times
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
when they fail to do so that is why we
 
00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
need this and we need to allow the right
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
of private action rather than prohibit
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
it which is currently in that law
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
um we do have a technical support
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
available I'm not going to open this up
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
to another hearing seeing that that
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
we've already gone through that stage
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
but if there are specific questions that
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
have to be asked you're welcome to do so
 
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
are we do we have somebody promoted here
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
now uh
 
00:40:06.609 --> 00:40:06.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
representative can you hear me specific
 
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
questions for Marissa first
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
I think I'd put one out there
 
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
go ahead thanks thanks very much Rick so
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you very much Miss Chase for
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
joining us this morning
 
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
um uh the question of that I was uh that
 
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
I'd like to pose is with respect to the
 
00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:35.579 align:start position:0%
I guess the scope of the um the
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
defendants in such a um write a private
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
action and on line five it talks about
 
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
school district or chartered Public
 
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
Schools but I know there's there's been
 
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
substantial work in this committee
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
to um to broaden the uh the scope of um
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
of of schools to uh I think we're seeing
 
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
in other bills the use of any approved
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
school and I was wondering if um if you
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
know how how that would be looked at
 
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
hi can you hear me
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay great sorry my dog is barking in
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
the background so I apologize a few
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
times in ahead of me
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for the question
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative luno I am not an expert
 
00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.950 align:start position:0%
representative luno I am not an expert
in

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
um how how
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
education law would apply I would just
 
00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
note that in the statute currently RSA
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
193 F colon 9 private right of action
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
not permitted this took effect in 2010
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
um the language says nothing in this
 
00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339 align:start position:0%
chapter cell supersede or replace
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
existing rights or remedies under any
 
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
other general or special law including
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
some of the law nor shall this chapter
 
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
create a private right of action for
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement of this chapter against
 
00:41:52.609 --> 00:41:52.619 align:start position:0%
here we go any school district or a
 
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
chartered public school or the state so
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
that language is actually directly from
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
the statute as it currently exists
 
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
right so follow up on that yes
 
00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:05.579 align:start position:0%
so so if a bullying event was was to
 
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
take place at an approved
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
um School under a tuition program
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
um uh whether that's a non-sectarian
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
school or sectarian school or or whatnot
 
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
would um uh would would the parents have
 
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh have a um a tort right or a write a
 
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
private action to uh to to take against
 
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
um representative I appreciate the
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
question I am not sure I cannot give a
 
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
definitive answer I will just say that
 
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
you know the statue currently says
 
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
against any school district or chartered
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
public school or the state
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
um I I truly don't know I'm happy to do
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
some more research and get back to you
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very thank you very much
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
Miss Chase
 
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
are there further questions for Miss
 
00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.010 align:start position:0%
are there further questions for Miss
Chase

00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
Chase
 
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
um yes I as you read that um
 
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
193 F uh colon nine it says uh nothing
 
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
in this chapter shall supersede or
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
replace existing rights or remedies
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah
 
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
um once that's repealed does that mean
 
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
that the private right of action does in
 
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
fact supersede and replace the existing
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know it thank you representative
 
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:32.460 align:start position:0%

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
let me find where the question was just
 
00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.530 align:start position:0%
let me find where the question was just
said

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.910 align:start position:0%
said
um

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
it is a high burden and I will note that
 
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.250 align:start position:0%
it is a high burden and I will note that
the

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
the statue only went to effect in 2010
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
prior to 2010 there was not the sort of
 
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
blanket immunity that barred these
 
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
actions and we we haven't heard
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
testimony I haven't heard testimony and
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any you know floodgates
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
of litigation that were happening before
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
the enactment of the statute
 
00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.030 align:start position:0%
the enactment of the statute
um

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
you know I I will say that the statute
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
is a high burden I think to
 
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's point that you
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
know you have to have documented
 
00:44:38.089 --> 00:44:38.099 align:start position:0%
evidence you have to have an actual
 
00:44:38.099 --> 00:44:39.349 align:start position:0%
evidence you have to have an actual
injury

00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
injury
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
someone can't just make an accusation
 
00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
and then you know go to court with a
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
blank check which is not how the system
 
00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:47.220 align:start position:0%
works I think there has to be repeated
 
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.910 align:start position:0%
works I think there has to be repeated
documented

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
documented
 
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.530 align:start position:0%
documented
um

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
actions that show a
 
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
injury that the agreed that's what I was
 
00:44:59.089 --> 00:44:59.099 align:start position:0%
trying to get to representative Mullen
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned aggrieved versus injury I
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
believe and aggrieved in injury is
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
essentially the same so any plaintiff
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
would have to show they have an injury
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
they would have to prove that they got
 
00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
the injury
 
00:45:14.329 --> 00:45:14.339 align:start position:0%
by growth negligence on behalf of the
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
defendant that they caused that by
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
repeated you know documented
 
00:45:22.849 --> 00:45:22.859 align:start position:0%
actions and that that entity had a duty
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
of care to the plaintiff that caused the
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
injury these are very high burdens
 
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
lawyers as I said in my email last night
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
lawyers work on contingency fee they
 
00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:35.579 align:start position:0%
front the cost of litigation up front
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's not a financial incentive to
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
take a case like this where there would
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
be you know frankly such little recovery
 
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
it's only in the most egregious of cases
 
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
where a student is is harmed to an
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
extent that anybody even wants to call a
 
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.710 align:start position:0%
extent that anybody even wants to call a
lawyer

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Miss cheese
 
00:45:57.609 --> 00:45:57.619 align:start position:0%
are there further technical questions of
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
immersive Chase yes representative thank
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh Ms Chase thank you for
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question as I read the
 
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation uh and I'm looking
 
00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
at line four specifically where it talks
 
00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:14.339 align:start position:0%
about any provision of this chapter I'm
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
assuming that chapter means 93 F not
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
just that subsection nine is that
 
00:46:18.839 --> 00:46:22.130 align:start position:0%
just that subsection nine is that
correct

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
foreign let me pull up where you are
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
looking so I can get on the same page
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
of this chapter so this chapter is 193 F
 
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
colon nine yes so is is it is the I
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
guess my question then attorney Jay says
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
is it 193 F or is it 193 specifically
 
00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
just F9
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
specifically F9 representative okay and
 
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to make clear I'm not an
 
00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:53.339 align:start position:0%
attorney I just represent them I just I
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
just want to make clear I'm happy to
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
have an attorney hop on the call if you
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
have further legal technical questions
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
but I I just don't want to mislead any
 
00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
members of the community that I have
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
some technical legal expertise that
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
that's my error but because my
 
00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
understanding that when it said chapter
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
it meant that any violation of 93 F
 
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
being the chapter would impact this and
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
a suit can be brought forward not just
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
93 uh F9 and I thought that that opens
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
up the whole Board of issues
 
00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you hey did anybody do we have any
 
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:32.579 align:start position:0%
lawyers on the committee I'm not sure
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock let me respond please
 
00:47:37.849 --> 00:47:37.859 align:start position:0%
um thank you Marissa not being an
 
00:47:37.859 --> 00:47:38.690 align:start position:0%
um thank you Marissa not being an
attorney

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
so that anything that's been said today
 
00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:44.579 align:start position:0%
um is is not you know not being
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
presented by an attorney you're correct
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
and whether it applies only to 193 F
 
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
colon 9 4 to 193 f
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
um the whole chapter
 
00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:58.970 align:start position:0%
um the whole chapter
um

00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
and we all have our interpretations I'm
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
not going to give you mine okay
 
00:48:07.329 --> 00:48:07.339 align:start position:0%
uh I I think it's a valid question
 
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative I mean thank you that was
 
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
my misunderstanding I thought we were
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
referencing Miss Chase because she was
 
00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
an attorney and I appreciate her saying
 
00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:16.140 align:start position:0%
it wasn't and you clarifying that
 
00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
particularly Rick but the my question
 
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
remains and I think it's a huge question
 
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
is if this F9 that phraseology this
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
chapter means the entire 93f that opens
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
the whole gamut of issues Way Beyond
 
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
this one specific issue that the sponsor
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
of Mr cordelli is trying to get across I
 
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
think so I I love to have Clarity from
 
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
Miss Fenton or some other lawyer if you
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
know any lawyers on the committee thank
 
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.290 align:start position:0%
know any lawyers on the committee thank
you

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner yes yes I noticed in
 
00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:47.579 align:start position:0%
the participant log uh rep attorney
 
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
Fenton is on board and I was wondering
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
if we could get some information from
 
00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.210 align:start position:0%
if we could get some information from
her

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:53.220 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.359 --> 00:49:04.069 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:49:04.079 --> 00:49:12.230 align:start position:0%
there
okay

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
good morning Diane are you familiar with
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
the question that's being talked about
 
00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.650 align:start position:0%
the question that's being talked about
here

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
I I am so just to clarify when there's
 
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:23.930 align:start position:0%
I I am so just to clarify when there's
reference

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
reference
 
00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
um to the chapter the chapter is 193 F
 
00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
in its entirety and you can see that
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
um if you flip back in your law book and
 
00:49:35.569 --> 00:49:35.579 align:start position:0%
I'm probably the only one who has it
 
00:49:37.609 --> 00:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
open in front of them but it's entitled
 
00:49:41.089 --> 00:49:41.099 align:start position:0%
chapter 193 F so chapter 193 f is
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
inclusive of all the various
 
00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.170 align:start position:0%
inclusive of all the various
sub-provisions

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
sub-provisions
 
00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.430 align:start position:0%
sub-provisions
um

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
yes is there a question representative
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
land yes that does parallel everything
 
00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
follow up please yes thank you thank you
 
00:50:02.089 --> 00:50:02.099 align:start position:0%
and thank you um uh for taking the
 
00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:03.230 align:start position:0%
and thank you um uh for taking the
question

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
um because that was my question because
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
I read program as being a a larger piece
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
than what absolutely we just heard so
 
00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
would that mean that this uh legal
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
course of action could be taken up or
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
any violation of 93f
 
00:50:18.359 --> 00:50:23.329 align:start position:0%

00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.599 --> 00:50:28.970 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
beat it that way but let me just
 
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
pull something up real quick because I
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
don't want to mislead you I think that
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
in the way I read this bill
 
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
I have way too many things open on my
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
computer so I I appreciate the
 
00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.829 align:start position:0%
computer so I I appreciate the
commitment

00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
Frozen Woodcock I would agree with your
 
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.849 align:start position:0%
Frozen Woodcock I would agree with your
interpretation

00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
that the way the bill is written
 
00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:18.059 align:start position:0%
it would allow for a right of action if
 
00:51:20.329 --> 00:51:20.339 align:start position:0%
there was any violation of any of the
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
provisions in RSA 193 f that is
 
00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
inclusive of 193 F9
 
00:51:26.819 --> 00:51:28.190 align:start position:0%
inclusive of 193 F9
um

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
that is just my opinion of it so I have
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
to give the lawyer disclaimer
 
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
um right I don't work for you you
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
haven't retained me I work for the state
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
but that is my brief interpretation of
 
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.410 align:start position:0%
but that is my brief interpretation of
it

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
um but I will also say that
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
gross negligence or willful misconduct
 
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
is a very high standard
 
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
and I do agree with the prior speaker
 
00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:55.910 align:start position:0%
and I do agree with the prior speaker
that

00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.510 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:59.809 --> 00:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
you cannot just go into court with any
 
00:51:59.819 --> 00:52:01.790 align:start position:0%
you cannot just go into court with any
uh

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
you have something hurt my feelings and
 
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
and I want to file this I think this is
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
set up to in large part prevent the
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
abuses of the system I think what this
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
does my interpretation of it and having
 
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
sat through testimony from the prior
 
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
legislative session on this
 
00:52:22.859 --> 00:52:24.109 align:start position:0%
legislative session on this
um

00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
this really is narrowly tailored at
 
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:32.220 align:start position:0%
those egregious moments in time and
 
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they they do happen
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
and so that is all that I'm comfortable
 
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
staying on on this bill I hope I've
 
00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
answered your questions I'm happy to
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
take any others
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
yeah yes if I may rather than like yes
 
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
attorney you have answered my questions
 
00:52:48.049 --> 00:52:48.059 align:start position:0%
thank you and I agree with you and
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are issues that need to
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
go and and we'll in negligence and
 
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
misconduct are are difficult to uh take
 
00:52:56.809 --> 00:52:56.819 align:start position:0%
to a much higher level I agree 100 I was
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
concerned about the just that phrase ER
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
the chapter that it opens up the entire
 
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
193f as you concurred
 
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
um although the intent of the bill
 
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
sounds fine I think the way it's written
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
is going to open up all kinds of
 
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.329 align:start position:0%
is going to open up all kinds of
mistakes

00:53:08.329 --> 00:53:08.339 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:11.160 align:start position:0%

it's like to hear that
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
um that this applies to the entire
 
00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
chapter 193 f and let me find out that
 
00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this chapter
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
is and you can look at 193 F2 purpose
 
00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
mid 10 is about building and cyber
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
bullying and protecting students from
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
physical emotional and psychological
 
00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
harm that is the purpose of this chapter
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
and that is the purpose of this bill
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for informing us on the intent
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill uh
 
00:54:07.079 --> 00:54:10.130 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill uh
representative

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
I'm going to allow one more question
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
here it looks like grab some wood talk
 
00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
you have another question well just yes
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative it's not a
 
00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
question it's a comment I don't want to
 
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
have representative cordelli leave off
 
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
with that statement
 
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
um it granted no one's questioned the
 
00:54:26.089 --> 00:54:26.099 align:start position:0%
value of the intent of the bill but we
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
look at 93 when you go to 93 F4 that
 
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
lays everything out what we're supposed
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
to be doing no one suggesting is not
 
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
good it's just a poorly written bill
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
that expl that opens up the entire gamma
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
of 93 F and it's it's not written well
 
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's going to come back to bite us it
 
00:54:42.849 --> 00:54:42.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't get to where it needs to be
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much I'm going
 
00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:47.180 align:start position:0%

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
very much okay the next bill of which
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh get is HB
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
422 and with that uh that's a a bill uh
 
00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
let me read it here relative to the one
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
half credit required course in the
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
United States New Hampshire government
 
00:56:32.329 --> 00:56:32.339 align:start position:0%
and Civics so you can all turn your
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
bills to 422 and I'll call upon
 
00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
represent a Moffett for a motion famous
 
00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to move to retain this
 
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
measure at this time and representative
 
00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.470 align:start position:0%
measure at this time and representative
Hopson

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
Hopson
 
00:56:48.049 --> 00:56:48.059 align:start position:0%
makes a second so the motion on the
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
table is to retain HB 422 made by
 
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt and second by
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative Hobson representative
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
office do you care to speak to your
 
00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.089 align:start position:0%
office do you care to speak to your
motion

00:56:59.089 --> 00:56:59.099 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099 align:start position:0%
I think that there's uh
 
00:57:05.089 --> 00:57:05.099 align:start position:0%
I certainly support the intent of this
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
we have some issues with imposing uh
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
credit curriculum requirements and I
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
think we need to look at this further
 
00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:16.930 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:16.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you is there any further
 
00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.670 align:start position:0%
okay thank you is there any further
discussion

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
yes represent Cornell
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say I think it every
 
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
student should take
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
um as much Civics as they possibly can I
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
checked to the programs of study in
 
00:57:34.079 --> 00:57:35.270 align:start position:0%
checked to the programs of study in
Manchester

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
um and they do require one semester of
 
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
civics and they require it in the
 
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
freshman year because it's a requirement
 
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
for graduation so they want students to
 
00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
take it and make sure they pass it in
 
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
case they don't they have time to
 
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
um make it up so while I think it's a
 
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
good idea I think many districts already
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
require if not all of them because I
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
think it's already in statutes that you
 
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
have to take a semester of civics but I
 
00:58:05.089 --> 00:58:05.099 align:start position:0%
think even the wording of taking it in
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
Junior or senior year
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
it disrupts school districts who already
 
00:58:12.109 --> 00:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
have made students take your freshman
 
00:58:14.329 --> 00:58:14.339 align:start position:0%
year like I said just in case they they
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
don't pass it they do have time to make
 
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
it up in order for graduation so I'm
 
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
happy to vote for retaining this
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much it's a further
 
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
discussion represent miles uh thank you
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I want to thank
 
00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
representative Moffat for making this
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
motion I know the passion that he has
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
for this many of us shared the same
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
passion for the issue of civics Etc but
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
I do think that this needs a little more
 
00:58:40.849 --> 00:58:40.859 align:start position:0%
study because there are some serious
 
00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
questions about its ramifications the
 
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
cost of the exam Etc so uh thank you
 
00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt and I will be
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:55.130 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for recognizing me
 
00:58:59.569 --> 00:58:59.579 align:start position:0%
the only thing that I would like to say
 
00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
is that with regards to high school
 
00:59:05.089 --> 00:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
students that are already enrolled as
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
Juniors and seniors I'm concerned that
 
00:59:10.809 --> 00:59:10.819 align:start position:0%
this would wreak havoc with their
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
long-range planning which may have begun
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
as representative Cornell said in grade
 
00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:18.780 align:start position:0%
nine and also I think we need to take
 
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
into consideration that there are in
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
fact schools in New Hampshire uh that
 
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
have prescribed programs for students
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
that are in Junior and Senior year I'm
 
00:59:32.890 --> 00:59:32.900 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
00:59:35.809 --> 00:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
some of the Career and Technical
 
00:59:39.069 --> 00:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
programs that kids are are enrolled in
 
00:59:42.049 --> 00:59:42.059 align:start position:0%
and uh the international Baccalaureate
 
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
program that have designated course
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
sequences and I'm not sure that there's
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
room in those schedules to add an
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
additional course thank you thank you
 
00:59:57.549 --> 00:59:57.559 align:start position:0%
very much just a further discussion
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes I'd just like to follow up on
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative mullen's point of view I
 
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
know particularly at the school I taught
 
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
care Sarge where students had to be bust
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
down to Concord for their CTE courses
 
01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
that um you know having a required
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
course in in the Junior and Senior year
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
was very difficult for them to fit in
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and much easier to fit in in the
 
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
freshman year so I would just reiterate
 
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
for the discussion just to wrap this up
 
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
it's my current belief that construction
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
right from our local responsibilities
 
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
and how you set your curriculum and your
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
syllabus up and of course the studies is
 
01:00:40.609 --> 01:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
reflective of that district and that
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
school board
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
and Personnel within the school and for
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
all the reasons which I mentioned today
 
01:00:50.089 --> 01:00:50.099 align:start position:0%
I also support retention
 
01:00:50.099 --> 01:00:53.750 align:start position:0%
I also support retention
um

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599 align:start position:0%

Barbara

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:47.180 align:start position:0%
Barbara
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.119 --> 01:01:57.589 align:start position:0%
 
27.

01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:57.599 --> 01:02:01.549 align:start position:0%
 
hey

01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
bro that's that's retained in our
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee it doesn't go anywhere those
 
01:02:07.569 --> 01:02:07.579 align:start position:0%
out there
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh the the next bill I'd like to
 
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
address and jump in a little bit is HB
 
01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.170 align:start position:0%
address and jump in a little bit is HB
267.

01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
um and 267 is relative to construction
 
01:02:24.289 --> 01:02:24.299 align:start position:0%
standards for schools
 
01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
and following this bill I'm going to
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
jump back to the other bill which we
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
have regarding the
 
01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.569 align:start position:0%
have regarding the
um

01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:32.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
establishing committee to study air
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
quality in school buildings so looking
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
at HB 267 first
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
and looking for a motion on 267 from
 
01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:47.100 align:start position:0%
represent Hobson yes
 
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.849 align:start position:0%
represent Hobson yes
[Music]

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
and foreign
 
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
so the motion has been made to retain HB
 
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
267 made by representative Hobson second
 
01:03:02.569 --> 01:03:02.579 align:start position:0%
by represent Saudi uh represent Hobson
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
do you have any comments uh this
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
uh representative do you have any
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
comments no no occur with that okay uh
 
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks very much um yeah I'd
 
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
support retain on this too because I
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
think there was a lot of um sort of new
 
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
information that came to light during
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the hearing and uh you know I I
 
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
agree we want to have our school
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
buildings that that have acoustical
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
properties that are that are good for
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
all students and um and we could use
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
we've uh discussed school buildings
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
numerous times in various uh pieces of
 
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
legislation and discussions
 
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
including during the course of the
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
summer with a commission
 
01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
and there are a number of issues
 
01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:12.059 align:start position:0%
associated with schools that come
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
underneath the standards for schools and
 
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
what we look at in terms of an
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
application for our building a project
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
and acoustical is very important as is
 
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
HVAC and a number of our other systems
 
01:04:28.609 --> 01:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
within our schools lighting Etc and we
 
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
know there's a relationship between all
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
those and achievement
 
01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:35.900 align:start position:0%
and it's my hope seeing that this is
 
01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:39.059 align:start position:0%
identified in a specific area which
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
deals with school building construction
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
standards by retaining this bill
 
01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
we can go we can address acoustical
 
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
status yes but we need to address some
 
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
of the other issues which we have
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
associated with these standards we must
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
have in our schools
 
01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
and so uh I'd like to see this become a
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
active subcommittee and seriously take a
 
01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
look at uh all these systems we have
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
that comprise and necessary in our
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
schools to include the others that I've
 
01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:11.579 align:start position:0%
mentioned and more
 
01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:15.140 align:start position:0%
so um I don't see any further
 
01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:20.339 align:start position:0%
hands up so let's have a vote on that
 
01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
the motion this motion is to retain
 
01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:26.900 align:start position:0%
house bill 267.
 
01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:30.299 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli yes
 
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
representative ball yes
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
representative Aller yes representative
 
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative Moffett yes
 
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative Hobson yes representative
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
Andrus yes representative Ford yes
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:53.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative sodi yes
 
01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
representative Miler yes representative
 
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
luno yes that is sure yes representative
 
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.089 --> 01:06:10.099 align:start position:0%
yes representative Mullen yes
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative lay
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
yes there's Woodcock yes
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd yes
 
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.430 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd yes
20-0

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
so we will retain that and uh I would
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
ask that if there are tools which would
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
like to actively get involved
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
um I won't I won't write down memes now
 
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
but be thinking about it on a something
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
maybe this will be an active
 
01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh it's been a topic of my
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
importance to us uh so I'd like to get
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
that one going as soon as possible uh to
 
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
be looking at construction standards in
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
our schools
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
uh the next bill which we will move to
 
01:06:59.809 --> 01:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
is going back now uh to uh HB 339
 
01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study air
 
01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
quality in school building
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
uh I've looked for a motion on that one
 
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
from represent Hobson
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
Beyond and repson address are you making
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
the second the second emotion thank you
 
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
very much uh represent Hobson do you
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
have some comments thank you thank you
 
01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
so this is a bill that establishes a
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
committee to study air quality in school
 
01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.829 align:start position:0%
committee to study air quality in school
buildings

01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
uh the recent pandemic that's shown a
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
light on the importance of clean air
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
their handling and air exchange and
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
school building
 
01:07:44.329 --> 01:07:44.339 align:start position:0%
uh we receive grant money from the
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
um through this the cares act that has
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
been used to increase air quality air
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
handling and air systems throughout New
 
01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.470 align:start position:0%
handling and air systems throughout New
Hampshire

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
additionally laws have been passed in
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
previous sessions that require policies
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
to be developed in schools and annual
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
investigations into air quality in
 
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
public schools so I feel that this bill
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:14.180 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:08:16.849 --> 01:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
reps Andros do you have you give second
 
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I feel that with covid-19
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
and All the Monies that school districts
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
have received during the last year and I
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
believe there's another amount coming
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
out to everybody I think they have done
 
01:08:41.329 --> 01:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
many things to improve the air quality
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
in our schools and I think this bill is
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
unneeded at this time
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.610 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
representative

01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I'm very
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
disappointed in this motion
 
01:08:58.249 --> 01:08:58.259 align:start position:0%
uh we had ample testimony
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
from people who are in the buildings
 
01:09:04.249 --> 01:09:04.259 align:start position:0%
who work there daily
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
who have said that there are problems
 
01:09:06.239 --> 01:09:07.510 align:start position:0%
who have said that there are problems
here

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the uh the
 
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
accommodations that have been made
 
01:09:14.209 --> 01:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
through the pandemic
 
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
but there is a need to have this study
 
01:09:18.169 --> 01:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
and we're always asking for us to look
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
at it in a deeper way very similar to
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
the loan that we just retained I don't
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
understand why we can't have both of
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
those together because they represent
 
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
problems that are taking place in
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
buildings right now
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
that are impacting student learning that
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
are impacting Personnel that are working
 
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
in those buildings
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
and with the testimony we had there was
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
ample evidence of a need for this
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
particular study so I'm very
 
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
disappointed in the Republican Congress
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
for for moving to it all this very
 
01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
disappointed in this and I will be
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
voting no on this
 
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
uh I I'd like to just make one comment
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh for for the whole committee I think
 
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
it's the entire at least it's my intent
 
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
uh and looking at invest in 267 which is
 
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
relative to construction standards for
 
01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.570 align:start position:0%
relative to construction standards for
schools

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
that that goes well beyond acoustical
 
01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
standards it goes into the air quality
 
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
standards which we're talking about
 
01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
and if in fact there is going to be a
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that's going to start out
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
immediately looking at that it's my
 
01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.209 align:start position:0%
immediately looking at that it's my
intent

01:10:29.209 --> 01:10:29.219 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
have this topic which is inclusive
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
within 339 covered within this broader
 
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
bill right here which is relative to
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
construction standards yes you know talk
 
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
specifically to
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
um the acoustical but the chapter it's
 
01:10:50.689 --> 01:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
again is dealing with construction
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
standards and so I believe that that
 
01:10:56.689 --> 01:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
this bill will be addressed in that way
 
01:10:59.209 --> 01:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
that we had some hands up right from San
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
Bruno no thanks very much Mr chair I I
 
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
agree with what representative Miler
 
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
said on this I mean uh and and and
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
honestly I agree with what you just said
 
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
um as well Rick that that that taking a
 
01:11:15.649 --> 01:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
look in conjunction with the acoustic
 
01:11:15.659 --> 01:11:17.030 align:start position:0%
look in conjunction with the acoustic
standards

01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
um study during the retain retaining 267
 
01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
that that retaining 339 would uh would
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense and and go into a
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive summer study on um on air
 
01:11:31.729 --> 01:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
quality and acoustic standards and maybe
 
01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
any other building standards and then
 
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
we've got two retained bills one of them
 
01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
that relates to Acoustics one of them
 
01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
that relates to air quality that could
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
be used that could be amended to either
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
change those building standards but to
 
01:11:48.169 --> 01:11:48.179 align:start position:0%
itl this
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
I think sends a terrible message to uh
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
to the general public to Granite Staters
 
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
to parents to families to school kids to
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
teachers to volunteers that that the New
 
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.890 align:start position:0%
teachers to volunteers that that the New
Hampshire

01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
um house doesn't care about indoor air
 
01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
quality because even though a lot of
 
01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
districts have implemented improvements
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
we we have we heard directly from the
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
the department of education's top
 
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
facilities person that we need to to to
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
have a close look at the indoor air
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
quality in our schools and um and I I
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
think I think passing this would be fine
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
but also I think retaining it would be
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
fine too so that we could we could do a
 
01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
comprehensive summer study and we'll
 
01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
have two vehicles with which to um to
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
amend to improve our building standards
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
going forward and I think that's a
 
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
that's a good message for granted
 
01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:46.090 align:start position:0%
that's a good message for granted
Staters

01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up yes I did Mr
 
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
 
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
um just to reiterate and build on what
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
my two colleagues have uh pointed out uh
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
yeah you know a lot of there was
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
reference to covid funding and that's
 
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
directly related to issues
 
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
brought about by covet but we also had
 
01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
much testimony about prior problems
 
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
long-standing HVAC problems in the
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
schools uh which cannot be necessarily
 
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
corrected using those funds and those
 
01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
funds will disappear at a certain point
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
and second I mean this notion that you
 
01:13:24.169 --> 01:13:24.179 align:start position:0%
can use 267 as the vehicle 267 very
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
explicitly and repeatedly in the bill
 
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
references only acoustical standards
 
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
that is all that we should be looking at
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
in that uh if if we're retaining that
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
and forming a subcommittee so I think
 
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
that you should retain 339 and combine
 
01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
create a subcommittee to look at both of
 
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
them simultaneous it makes no sense to
 
01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
do otherwise uh and again very
 
01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
disappointed if if we're going to itl
 
01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:50.689 align:start position:0%
disappointed if if we're going to itl
this

01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
um that just sends a direct message we
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
don't care about your basic health
 
01:13:56.689 --> 01:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
in the schools we don't care about the
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
students Health the pupils Health the
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
Educators Health the staff Health okay
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of systems that are in
 
01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
in deep problems uh the Department of
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
Education made that clear to us and so I
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
think this should at the very least be
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
routine thank you thank you very much uh
 
01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:14.930 align:start position:0%
routine thank you thank you very much uh
representative

01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I just um
 
01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
had a question as to why because I know
 
01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:22.140 align:start position:0%
when we talked about this beforehand
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
what we were planning on doing was
 
01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
combining the two into one retain the
 
01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
one it all the other just so we have one
 
01:14:36.450 --> 01:14:36.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:38.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I mean 339 very or not three
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
through nine two six seven explicitly is
 
01:14:45.649 --> 01:14:45.659 align:start position:0%
about acoustical issues it references
 
01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
acoustical standards uh the construction
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
standards are in regards to school
 
01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.370 align:start position:0%
standards are in regards to school
acoustics

01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
acoustics
 
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
and for a subcommittee to go somehow
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
beyond that is to go well beyond uh the
 
01:14:59.570 --> 01:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
subject matter of the bill at hand which
 
01:15:01.370 --> 01:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
is supposedly being studied by the
 
01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:04.460 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thank you
 
01:15:08.209 --> 01:15:08.219 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want to feel like beating
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
the same dead horse
 
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
um but there may be a pointy here
 
01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
somewhere I guess the representative may
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
say uh the convinced committee clearly
 
01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh if we look at the on page
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
one line one two and three it talks
 
01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
about study the air quality and pause
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
and improve the environmental factors of
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
schools it's not talking about new
 
01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
construction it's not talking about
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen five years from
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
now we get all these new figures
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
together we're talking about looking at
 
01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
the current schools in New Hampshire
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
which we know are are in a lot of them
 
01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
in miserable State when it comes to air
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
quality the impact on Student Success
 
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
and the overall health of the faculty
 
01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
and the students that are in them I
 
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
think this bill is is a whole different
 
01:15:55.729 --> 01:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
ball of wax than just the construction
 
01:15:58.370 --> 01:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
of the acoustical tile uh new building
 
01:16:00.649 --> 01:16:00.659 align:start position:0%
construction this building to me is says
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
to every every teacher in New Hampshire
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
and every student parent in New
 
01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:05.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're concerned about what you
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
breathe when you go out of that building
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
and we're so concerned about it we're
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
going to do an entire study to come up
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
with the best recommendations how to
 
01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
improve it that's what that says to me
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say anything about new
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
construction it's a whole different bill
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
I I would much concur as he's built this
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
committee go forward let them do their
 
01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.470 align:start position:0%
committee go forward let them do their
work

01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Mullen thank
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to point to out the
 
01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
aspect of the term air quality that
 
01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
sometimes gets overlooked air quality in
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
a school building is more than just
 
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
ventilation and HVAC in our community
 
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
alone uh well in our state actually in
 
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
New England I'm going to go as far as to
 
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
say why we build flat roofed buildings
 
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
in New England that leak all winter long
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
and result in mold problems and uh and
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
repairs that that that cost us all I
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
don't know but in our town mold has been
 
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
a problem and it was discovered because
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
the air quality became bad we had a bat
 
01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
infestation in one of the buildings and
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
I'm talking like horror movie quality
 
01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
stuff and the only reason that we knew
 
01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
it was because the air quality became so
 
01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:24.980 align:start position:0%
bad that people were getting affected
 
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
respiratorily so I have no problem
 
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
retaining both of these bills and if
 
01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
your subcommittee wants to come out with
 
01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
one bill that encompasses everything
 
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
so be it but
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think we're I think we're
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
missing an opportunity to deliver a
 
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
message that we truly want to take on
 
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
all forms of uh mishap that affect air
 
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
quality in our buildings thank you
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh represent Tanner
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
um and I guess uh you know before before
 
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
covet even came asthma is a tremendous
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh problem in in schools with students
 
01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.750 align:start position:0%
uh problem in in schools with students
and

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
um they need air quality uh control also
 
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
buildings have been cobbled together
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
where I know in in my school one section
 
01:18:23.530 --> 01:18:23.540 align:start position:0%
was built in you know
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
1969 and another section built in the
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
late 80s or 90s and an Edition was added
 
01:18:32.209 --> 01:18:32.219 align:start position:0%
here or there I'm sure it happens in
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
many schools and lo and behold the
 
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
problem was uh air quality air air
 
01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:39.850 align:start position:0%
problem was uh air quality air air
ventilation

01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:39.860 align:start position:0%
ventilation
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
and it took a lot of effort on parents
 
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
part to actually get the school to look
 
01:18:47.209 --> 01:18:47.219 align:start position:0%
at it
 
01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:50.219 align:start position:0%
um at what was happening we also in
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
Sunapee have a school that's almost 100
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
years old that has the same problem as
 
01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:56.699 align:start position:0%
the lob it was designed with Steam Heat
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
and uh has no ventilation station system
 
01:19:01.209 --> 01:19:01.219 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
and covid funds will not address all
 
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
these issues and nor would it point out
 
01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
places for people to school districts to
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
look for these issues and to make some
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
um some mitigating uh
 
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
construction or whatever so I too think
 
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
that this bill is equally important as
 
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
the acoustic Bill and separate that it
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
is actually a bill that that has a lot
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
of need in in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
right now so I would I would really say
 
01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
retain this bill make it make it an
 
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
important bill uh make it a statement
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
from this education committee that that
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
air quality has been a problem before
 
01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
covid and probably will be afterwards
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
but we want to study it and come up with
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
some conclusions about and some
 
01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
recommendations thank you
 
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
okay what I'm going to do at this point
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
in time before we go on with any further
 
01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
questions kind of a recess uh the
 
01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
committee for me for about 10 minutes
 
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh Democrats look caucus as well Mel
 
01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
so okay so that so let's let's come back

so okay so that so let's let's come back
at

01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
the clock on the walls basically saying
 
01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:29.930 align:start position:0%
the clock on the walls basically saying
it's

01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
oh almost 10 30 here by you know MLB

makes it easier
 
01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.010 align:start position:0%
makes it easier
okay

01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:43.020 align:start position:0%

01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
because I
 
01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
was a team in two parts and the team was
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%

syndrome
where

01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%

01:44:45.649 --> 01:44:45.659 align:start position:0%
you know uh working with his legs and

anything really active for about three
 
01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:51.900 align:start position:0%

representative Mullen
 
01:49:56.689 --> 01:49:56.699 align:start position:0%
yes representative light yes it's under
 
01:50:02.169 --> 01:50:02.179 align:start position:0%
Woodcock yes representative glass yes
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
unanimous 20-0 thank you very much
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh so I will be putting together a
 
01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
committee to look at this uh both issues
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
um be it a committee of the whole or a
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee depending on how many
 
01:50:20.689 --> 01:50:20.699 align:start position:0%
people uh want to be participants in
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
this as I've stated before I believe
 
01:50:26.090 --> 01:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
this extremely important issue
 
01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:29.699 align:start position:0%
uh and and both these fields are
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
important and it goes further that we
 
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
have other
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
systems within our schools which need
 
01:50:36.119 --> 01:50:38.030 align:start position:0%
systems within our schools which need
attention

01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:50:40.729 --> 01:50:40.739 align:start position:0%
um so I hope we can get on it as quickly
 
01:50:42.590 --> 01:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
as possible I think this is almost even
 
01:50:44.330 --> 01:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
a better way of doing it than waiting
 
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
for a bill to go through the Senate if
 
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
it makes it through the Senate uh where
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
they're not really a pro uh supporting
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee development this year but then
 
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
to have to wait for something to be
 
01:50:58.970 --> 01:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
signed in we can start right now and we
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
can answer the the spring months we have
 
01:51:05.090 --> 01:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
to try to work with Amy Clark and
 
01:51:06.770 --> 01:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
company over there and other
 
01:51:10.609 --> 01:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
professionals to get some answers to
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
these real important issues thank you
 
01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
very much Paul
 
01:51:21.169 --> 01:51:21.179 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to now return to HB 319
 
01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:23.219 align:start position:0%
regarding students in this University
 
01:51:25.070 --> 01:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
and Community College systems of New
 
01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to pass the United States
 
01:51:30.729 --> 01:51:30.739 align:start position:0%
citizenship and immigrations Services uh
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
Civics naturalization test
 
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to look to represent for a
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
promotion place
 
01:51:42.109 --> 01:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you Mr chair I'd like to
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
make promotion of the amendment that was
 
01:51:45.890 --> 01:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
sent to the committee uh a couple days
 
01:51:56.770 --> 01:51:56.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
you've got to put a motion on the floor
 
01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
first before you deal with the amendment
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
yes I like to roll over
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
OTP uh as amended
 
01:52:07.679 --> 01:52:10.729 align:start position:0%
OTP uh as amended
okay

01:52:10.729 --> 01:52:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:12.659 align:start position:0%
now just
 
01:52:18.010 --> 01:52:18.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
is fine and then
 
01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:26.330 align:start position:0%
is fine and then
um

01:52:26.330 --> 01:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:26.340 --> 01:53:19.930 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:53:19.930 --> 01:53:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:26.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:28.970 --> 01:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
which does reflect the concern has been
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
we've received from uh ccsnh to the U.S
 
01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:44.830 align:start position:0%
we've received from uh ccsnh to the U.S
usnh

01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
so the amendment uh clearly exempts
 
01:53:51.010 --> 01:53:51.020 align:start position:0%
certificate programs it also incense
 
01:53:53.649 --> 01:53:53.659 align:start position:0%
graduate and postgraduate
 
01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
programs another concern
 
01:53:58.370 --> 01:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment pushes back the
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
implementation date to January 1st 2023.
 
01:54:03.890 --> 01:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
that should just move forward that would
 
01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
give all priorities plenty of time to
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
prepare and Implement uh I also point
 
01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
out that uh if HB 320 the high school
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
requirement which has already passed the
 
01:54:18.129 --> 01:54:18.139 align:start position:0%
house if that should move forward
 
01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
that would in large part satisfy the
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
Collegiate requirement that we're
 
01:54:25.129 --> 01:54:25.139 align:start position:0%
looking at here
 
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh and also point out that a number of
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
other states have already put this into
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
place Florida has Missouri just passed
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
the subjects and extensions so uh this
 
01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
is something that's being done elsewhere
 
01:54:39.770 --> 01:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh I do want to point out that it can be
 
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
administered online I've had
 
01:54:43.609 --> 01:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
conversations with the university and
 
01:54:45.370 --> 01:54:45.380 align:start position:0%
Community College people
 
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
so the fact that this can be very easily
 
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh put online so that students can take
 
01:54:55.490 --> 01:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
it at their convenience uh at any point
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
during their college Journey taking as
 
01:54:59.930 --> 01:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
many times as they need to have taken
 
01:55:02.410 --> 01:55:02.420 align:start position:0%
online there's no need for
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
the College of suspended time creating
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
the test administering the test or
 
01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
anything that we're breaking the test
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
and finally uh we certainly since we
 
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
need or the desire for this and I uh
 
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
this bipartisan sport I hope it was more
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair thank you are
 
01:55:24.850 --> 01:55:24.860 align:start position:0%
there further comments from the uh
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
no I just think that awareness if
 
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
nothing else is uh extremely important I
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
think that that too many kids are even
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
graduating from college and don't even
 
01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
know the answers to this question so I I
 
01:55:43.490 --> 01:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
just I don't see anything wrong with it
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's not a great burden and I think
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
we live in the United States or America
 
01:55:50.930 --> 01:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't know these things right
 
01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
and that's how I feel strongly about
 
01:55:56.090 --> 01:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you uh further comments
 
01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative uh Cornell
 
01:56:00.890 --> 01:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly how this will work
 
01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
I help representative Moffitt could
 
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
explain so they're not going to take the
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
naturalization test that's officially
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
online and have that scored and graded
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
because that cost 725 dollars to do that
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
um so is the University or Community
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
College going to
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
put the online test on some server that
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
they have and the students will take
 
01:56:27.470 --> 01:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
that or I don't I can't I don't know how
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:34.370 --> 01:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
sure now thanks for the question uh sure
 
01:56:37.370 --> 01:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
the proposed measure specifically refers
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
to the 108 assessment in over 120
 
01:56:45.649 --> 01:56:45.659 align:start position:0%
questions would be part of the
 
01:56:49.370 --> 01:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
assessment uh what can and if this moves
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
forward what uh I expect wouldn't be
 
01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
done would be simply for the
 
01:56:57.530 --> 01:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
institutions to put this online I uh
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
I've taught in both the university and
 
01:57:02.209 --> 01:57:02.219 align:start position:0%
Community College systems and the
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
university system has a little what they
 
01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
call a little capability in blackwoods
 
01:57:09.649 --> 01:57:09.659 align:start position:0%
community college system had
 
01:57:13.129 --> 01:57:13.139 align:start position:0%
and uh it's very easy to take 128
 
01:57:14.810 --> 01:57:14.820 align:start position:0%
questions presented myself many times
 
01:57:18.410 --> 01:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
and just simply put it on a program and
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
make it available to be taken to the
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
students so uh there's no 725 charge uh
 
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's so it's very easy to put it online
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
and for the students who uh take it at
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
and yes you may
 
01:57:37.609 --> 01:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
so if they're taking it at home at their
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
Leisure online there's nothing to
 
01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
prevent them from already having all the
 
01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
answers printed out and looking at them
 
01:57:46.810 --> 01:57:46.820 align:start position:0%
while they're taking the test
 
01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:49.739 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the specifics in the
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
administration uh ultimately we would
 
01:57:56.450 --> 01:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
leave to the uh institutions but it's
 
01:57:59.330 --> 01:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
like any other exam I have done many uh
 
01:58:01.729 --> 01:58:01.739 align:start position:0%
assessments and exercises and exams
 
01:58:04.129 --> 01:58:04.139 align:start position:0%
online and we're asking part of thousand
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
security measures that can be taken and
 
01:58:09.050 --> 01:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
as far as stabbing the uh the questions
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
the questions of public knowledge uh
 
01:58:14.930 --> 01:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
they're out there and uh you know as far
 
01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
as that specific concern about having
 
01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
the questions available to take the
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
assessment uh my biggest concern is that
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
this information wash over and it's
 
01:58:25.970 --> 01:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
noticed and if they know it one way or
 
01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
another the specifics of the
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
administration uh again uh we would
 
01:58:33.050 --> 01:58:33.060 align:start position:0%
leave to the institutions
 
01:58:35.330 --> 01:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
Roxanna Ellison
 
01:58:38.689 --> 01:58:38.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I guess I would
 
01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
like to question the basic premise that
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
if college and university students could
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
pass this test and I guess the same
 
01:58:47.930 --> 01:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
thing is true with high school students
 
01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
that passing this test is any way
 
01:58:54.589 --> 01:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
connected to being an active articulate
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
intelligent citizen uh I guess I'm
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
speaking as someone a high school former
 
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
High School teacher who spent four years
 
01:59:03.169 --> 01:59:03.179 align:start position:0%
teaching year-long U.S government
 
01:59:05.629 --> 01:59:05.639 align:start position:0%
courses which was a required course for
 
01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:10.820 align:start position:0%
all seniors uh and this this particular
 
01:59:13.729 --> 01:59:13.739 align:start position:0%
approach I think we're kidding ourselves
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
if we think this is going to get
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
students to be where we want them to be
 
01:59:21.290 --> 01:59:21.300 align:start position:0%
or yeah adults to be where they want to
 
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
be I mean being able to answer a
 
01:59:25.850 --> 01:59:25.860 align:start position:0%
question or questions about who was
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
president during World War One or being
 
01:59:31.070 --> 01:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
able to name one Indian tribe or being
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
able to tell if both the President and
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
Vice President no longer serve who
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
becomes the president those
 
01:59:41.330 --> 01:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
in my mind as an educator of social
 
01:59:45.290 --> 01:59:45.300 align:start position:0%
studies are not linked at all to where
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
we want our students to be when they
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
come out so I I would be voting against
 
01:59:50.990 --> 01:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
01:59:53.330 --> 01:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
reps L.A
 
01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:56.689 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:58.729 --> 01:59:58.739 align:start position:0%
a couple of things here
 
01:59:58.739 --> 01:59:59.450 align:start position:0%
a couple of things here
um

01:59:59.450 --> 01:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
going back to the point that was raised
 
02:00:04.129 --> 02:00:04.139 align:start position:0%
obviously the answers are all out there
 
02:00:04.139 --> 02:00:05.350 align:start position:0%
obviously the answers are all out there
already

02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be any sort of
 
02:00:10.609 --> 02:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
proctoring or any sort of controls that
 
02:00:12.649 --> 02:00:12.659 align:start position:0%
would require
 
02:00:15.410 --> 02:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
um University or Community College to be
 
02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:17.820 align:start position:0%
more directly engaged it would be more
 
02:00:20.330 --> 02:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
complicated than simply just putting up
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
a test because if you just simply put up
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
the test that anybody can take at any
 
02:00:26.290 --> 02:00:26.300 align:start position:0%
time it is very easy
 
02:00:30.490 --> 02:00:30.500 align:start position:0%
to Simply have the set of answers
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
and just type away and put the answers
 
02:00:36.050 --> 02:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
in this is not how I would ever give an
 
02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:37.850 align:start position:0%
in this is not how I would ever give an
exam

02:00:37.850 --> 02:00:37.860 align:start position:0%
exam
 
02:00:40.129 --> 02:00:40.139 align:start position:0%
I've taught for over 30 years in higher
 
02:00:42.910 --> 02:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
education full-time I teach U.S history
 
02:00:45.649 --> 02:00:45.659 align:start position:0%
I'm obviously deeply concerned about the
 
02:00:47.050 --> 02:00:47.060 align:start position:0%
issue of civics
 
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
not only do I teach U.S history
 
02:00:52.490 --> 02:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
particularly political history uh but
 
02:00:53.930 --> 02:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
obviously I've been in the legislature
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
so I have a clear interest here and the
 
02:00:58.250 --> 02:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
concern that we see here that's being
 
02:01:00.530 --> 02:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
expressed by everybody and I share that
 
02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:01.450 align:start position:0%
expressed by everybody and I share that
concern

02:01:01.450 --> 02:01:01.460 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:01:05.330 --> 02:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
is a concern that has been uh repeatedly
 
02:01:08.510 --> 02:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
voiced and demonstrated through polls
 
02:01:11.089 --> 02:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
surveys Etc all the way back to the 19
 
02:01:11.099 --> 02:01:12.350 align:start position:0%
surveys Etc all the way back to the 19
teens

02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
teens
 
02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:13.729 align:start position:0%
teens
okay

02:01:13.729 --> 02:01:13.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
um this is not a new issue
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
and simply giving a test like this
 
02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
will accomplish nothing
 
02:01:24.050 --> 02:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
because it is accomplished nothing in
 
02:01:26.089 --> 02:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
the past when you do it this way if
 
02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to teach Civics you need to
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
connect it to something that is real
 
02:01:33.649 --> 02:01:33.659 align:start position:0%
that is part of the students lives that
 
02:01:36.169 --> 02:01:36.179 align:start position:0%
they can use that they can make their
 
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
own simply answering questions will not
 
02:01:42.890 --> 02:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
do that this will not and this notion
 
02:01:46.010 --> 02:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
that somehow there'll be some process of
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
osmosis that will make the student a
 
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
better citizen by knowing these little
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
factoids it is not going to result in
 
02:02:01.310 --> 02:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
any such results at all uh so you know I
 
02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
I think it is
 
02:02:06.430 --> 02:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
the motive behind it is is good
 
02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
but the approach is completely
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
mistaken and and it does not follow what
 
02:02:17.629 --> 02:02:17.639 align:start position:0%
everything we know about education and
 
02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
how students learn particularly today
 
02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
um this will not do the trick whatsoever
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
I also would you know question why are
 
02:02:29.930 --> 02:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
we sticking with the 128 exam uh
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
question exam when the U.S United States
 
02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
is now using the 100 question exam from
 
02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
2008. the USCIS is uh in the process
 
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
right now of phasing out the 128 exam or
 
02:02:47.930 --> 02:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
a question exam and is now moving back
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
to the 100 question exam so again I I
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
think you know the motive is fine but
 
02:02:58.010 --> 02:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
this will not even remotely accomplish
 
02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
and in fact what this will do it will
 
02:03:03.890 --> 02:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
diminish students interest in Civics
 
02:03:06.169 --> 02:03:06.179 align:start position:0%
because it will quite clearly send the
 
02:03:06.179 --> 02:03:07.850 align:start position:0%
because it will quite clearly send the
message

02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
message
 
02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
that we just apply a simple Band-Aid we
 
02:03:13.550 --> 02:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
just apply a simple test which carries
 
02:03:16.669 --> 02:03:16.679 align:start position:0%
no real meaning to it it is completely
 
02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
disconnected to everything else in their
 
02:03:21.890 --> 02:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
educational progress
 
02:03:24.290 --> 02:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
um and that you simply do this here are
 
02:03:25.930 --> 02:03:25.940 align:start position:0%
the answers
 
02:03:29.209 --> 02:03:29.219 align:start position:0%
regurgitate them take the test now
 
02:03:32.089 --> 02:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
you're fully educated by our standard on
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
Civics and I think that's a pretty low
 
02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
standard to adopt so I will have to vote
 
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
against this thank you thank you
 
02:03:41.570 --> 02:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
and without due respect uh
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative Blake the way I look at
 
02:03:48.410 --> 02:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
it differently
 
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
and and it's perfectly fine I understand
 
02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from
 
02:03:57.290 --> 02:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
I always felt that
 
02:03:57.300 --> 02:03:58.370 align:start position:0%
I always felt that
um

02:03:58.370 --> 02:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:02.330 --> 02:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
oh in in today's world we
 
02:04:05.330 --> 02:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
we can look up anything we want if I
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
want to know the answer to something uh
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
is John Wayne still alive whatever you
 
02:04:13.129 --> 02:04:13.139 align:start position:0%
type it into Google and there's your
 
02:04:13.139 --> 02:04:14.990 align:start position:0%
type it into Google and there's your
answer

02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:04:19.129 --> 02:04:19.139 align:start position:0%
what to me what it does is
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
as a part of educating kids in Civics
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
this is not the only thing you know you
 
02:04:30.290 --> 02:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
do this test and and you're you're done
 
02:04:31.790 --> 02:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
you know everything you need to know
 
02:04:35.330 --> 02:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
that isn't the way I look at it it's an
 
02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:36.550 align:start position:0%
that isn't the way I look at it it's an
awareness

02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
awareness
 
02:04:41.209 --> 02:04:41.219 align:start position:0%
of the country it's like giving the kids
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
an open bookcast and and many teachers
 
02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
do that they they give kids a quiz and
 
02:04:52.450 --> 02:04:52.460 align:start position:0%
it's it's an open book test your
 
02:04:55.209 --> 02:04:55.219 align:start position:0%
you're searching for the information
 
02:04:57.729 --> 02:04:57.739 align:start position:0%
you're reading the information
 
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
you are coming up with an answer and
 
02:05:04.850 --> 02:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
you're not necessarily going to remember
 
02:05:07.850 --> 02:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
all of that but you're being exposed to
 
02:05:11.450 --> 02:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
it and I think it's part of the total
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
picture of learning about civics
 
02:05:17.089 --> 02:05:17.099 align:start position:0%
government the United States of America
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
all that put in together it's just a
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
small part but everybody would have to
 
02:05:27.410 --> 02:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
do that so they at least got that small
 
02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
part if they managed to wiggle their way
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
out of any other Civics courses or
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
history or anything else they would have
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
a little piece
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
so that they have some sort of an
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
awareness and and that's the way I look
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
at it it's probably a very demented way
 
02:05:48.410 --> 02:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
of looking at it but it's my opinion and
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
and I think it's it's important and
 
02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
especially for a lot of kids who maybe
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
aren't uh good memorizers here I am are
 
02:06:03.290 --> 02:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
um you know just to be exposed to it and
 
02:06:07.070 --> 02:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
to have to find the information or or to
 
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
recall the information
 
02:06:11.629 --> 02:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
it'll remain there something will come
 
02:06:14.689 --> 02:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
up something will stick with them and
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
and that's just the way I look at it
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:24.530 --> 02:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair let me first begin by
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
assuring representative Shaw that she is
 
02:06:29.930 --> 02:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
not demented
 
02:06:32.689 --> 02:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
I I have worked in the field I know
 
02:06:34.729 --> 02:06:34.739 align:start position:0%
demented when I see it and it's not
 
02:06:36.770 --> 02:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative Shaw
 
02:06:39.050 --> 02:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate that you're quite
 
02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:40.149 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate that you're quite
welcome

02:06:40.149 --> 02:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
so uh I I thank you uh representative
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
Moffett for taking my question first I
 
02:06:47.209 --> 02:06:47.219 align:start position:0%
have a question for you would you
 
02:06:50.030 --> 02:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
believe representative Moffett
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
that I am old enough that I remember
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
when it used to be printed on materials
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
in school buildings that we were not
 
02:07:03.770 --> 02:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
allowed to photocopy or Xerox any
 
02:07:06.770 --> 02:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
testing materials without either
 
02:07:10.010 --> 02:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
purchasing the license or contacting the
 
02:07:12.830 --> 02:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
owner or whatever the case may be so my
 
02:07:15.050 --> 02:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
question to you is who has the
 
02:07:20.109 --> 02:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
proprietary rights to this exam
 
02:07:20.119 --> 02:07:21.770 align:start position:0%
proprietary rights to this exam
and

02:07:21.770 --> 02:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
um our college is going to be
 
02:07:27.770 --> 02:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
responsible for either buying a license
 
02:07:31.970 --> 02:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
or contacting immigration services or I
 
02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
I mean do we know I guess my question is
 
02:07:36.530 --> 02:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
do we know that we can just freely uh
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
take it off of the internet
 
02:07:41.570 --> 02:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for your question uh yeah
 
02:07:44.570 --> 02:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
the exam is in the public domain so uh
 
02:07:47.209 --> 02:07:47.219 align:start position:0%
it's been used uh
 
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
100 question versions
 
02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
in the 128 version the same way uh yes
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's the public domain it's great for
 
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
thanks very much uh represent the mafia
 
02:08:09.950 --> 02:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
you had a comment you wanted to make uh
 
02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I think this year uh I just also
 
02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
want to say that I do not think
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative at all and I I do want to
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
say very quickly I I do completely
 
02:08:22.850 --> 02:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
disagree with with uh representative and
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
with uh representative sentiments
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
um this is not intended to solve
 
02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
everything and we I or we have never
 
02:08:33.950 --> 02:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
said it's intended to solve everything
 
02:08:37.209 --> 02:08:37.219 align:start position:0%
and also these are not irrelevant
 
02:08:40.250 --> 02:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
factoids I'll say that again I don't
 
02:08:42.350 --> 02:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
think these are irrelevant factoids
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
these are the basic fundamentals and
 
02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
tools that that students or people or
 
02:08:51.410 --> 02:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
adults or anyone should have uh if
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
they're going to have a sense of how our
 
02:08:56.810 --> 02:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
government works and so I I completely
 
02:08:59.390 --> 02:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
distributed their development factories
 
02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
and then the last I think the 128 versus
 
02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:04.580 align:start position:0%
100 100 questions
 
02:09:09.050 --> 02:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
test yes we specifically asked 128 uh
 
02:09:10.970 --> 02:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
you know a business a little bit more
 
02:09:13.070 --> 02:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
rigorous but also so there'd be no
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
confusion uh because there are multiple
 
02:09:19.550 --> 02:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh citizenship testing specifically
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
identified the 2020 version so there
 
02:09:25.370 --> 02:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
will be no uh no diffusion
 
02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
02:09:31.490 --> 02:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ladd I have two
 
02:09:33.709 --> 02:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
questions one is for representative
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
moffatt and one I I I'd ask if you would
 
02:09:40.609 --> 02:09:40.619 align:start position:0%
allow me uh 90 seconds on a different a
 
02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
similar topic and involved topic I
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
regards this to representative Moffett
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be clear uh are you
 
02:09:51.530 --> 02:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
are you assuring us that students at the
 
02:09:54.910 --> 02:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
cause level will not be
 
02:09:58.910 --> 02:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
charged any money Administration scoring
 
02:10:01.310 --> 02:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
on the college credits for this and I
 
02:10:03.890 --> 02:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
say that because student debt New
 
02:10:05.570 --> 02:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of the leading reasons
 
02:10:07.129 --> 02:10:07.139 align:start position:0%
we don't have young to stay in New
 
02:10:10.129 --> 02:10:10.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so can can you assure me that
 
02:10:11.810 --> 02:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
this legislation is not going to cost
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
college students anything
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative uh what I
 
02:10:18.589 --> 02:10:18.599 align:start position:0%
can certainly say is that this should
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
not cost anyone anything like someone
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
the percent institution always can try
 
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
to attach a fee to something but uh
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't you give it to your question uh
 
02:10:30.890 --> 02:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
this is already this exam has already
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
been given in this being given across
 
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
the country uh three uh and it's in the
 
02:10:41.629 --> 02:10:41.639 align:start position:0%
public domain and uh so this should not
 
02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
um I would like to allow I have the to
 
02:10:53.330 --> 02:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
allow me to take 90 seconds and get
 
02:10:56.450 --> 02:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
people involved in this democracy
 
02:11:01.010 --> 02:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't know where you're going with
 
02:11:04.490 --> 02:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
that I'm going I'm going exactly about
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm not going to Veer off it
 
02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%

02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Ladd and
 
02:11:17.089 --> 02:11:17.099 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm going to ask all of

out everyone
 
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
now this test requires that people with
 
02:11:30.649 --> 02:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
65 new younger folks we're going to let
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%

sixth question almost done
 
02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
I can't write that fast if you even know
 
02:12:58.209 --> 02:12:58.219 align:start position:0%
the answer you don't yeah
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
I can't answer why why that fast what
 
02:13:04.189 --> 02:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
amendment gives citizenship to all
 
02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:10.020 align:start position:0%

why does the flag have 13 stripes
 
02:13:23.629 --> 02:13:23.639 align:start position:0%

02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
out of those eight to pass and be a good
 
02:13:33.410 --> 02:13:33.420 align:start position:0%

that's not why
 
02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:29.290 --> 02:14:29.300 align:start position:0%

thank you Barbara don't have to mention
either

02:14:32.450 --> 02:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:14:34.669 --> 02:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
what what amendment can citizenship to
 
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
all persons born in the U.S
 
02:14:40.850 --> 02:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
it'd be 14. why did the U.S getting
 
02:14:42.530 --> 02:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
unless representative cordelli because
 
02:14:44.569 --> 02:14:44.579 align:start position:0%
he's so excited here why the U.S enter
 
02:14:46.010 --> 02:14:46.020 align:start position:0%

02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
I was gonna say money is money answers
 
02:15:01.129 --> 02:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
and finally why are the 13 stripes 13
 
02:15:01.139 --> 02:15:02.810 align:start position:0%
and finally why are the 13 stripes 13
colonies

02:15:02.810 --> 02:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
colonies
 
02:15:04.669 --> 02:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
okay so you get five out of eight you
 
02:15:06.770 --> 02:15:06.780 align:start position:0%
could be a U.S citizen Barber
 
02:15:12.770 --> 02:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:14.209 --> 02:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
thank you for that option representative
 
02:15:16.010 --> 02:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
land I appreciate the uh allowing that
 
02:15:17.330 --> 02:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
so everybody knows the test we're
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:15:20.810 --> 02:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
in regard to The Selective Service I
 
02:15:22.370 --> 02:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
don't think it really does much of
 
02:15:23.930 --> 02:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
anything seeing that I got my draft
 
02:15:27.550 --> 02:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
notice how I came home from Vietnam
 
02:15:30.109 --> 02:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
I was number 10 and I was in basic I
 
02:15:31.609 --> 02:15:31.619 align:start position:0%
hear you
 
02:15:33.530 --> 02:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to go on to the next
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
question representative Milo uh thank
 
02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you chairman Ladd uh
 
02:15:41.390 --> 02:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt you said that uh
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
this bill would exempt uh those who are
 
02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
taking uh certificate courses or or do I
 
02:15:54.250 --> 02:15:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:56.209 --> 02:15:56.219 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
02:16:00.649 --> 02:16:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:02.810 align:start position:0%
I think it's on line seven actually
 
02:16:02.810 --> 02:16:05.450 align:start position:0%
I think it's on line seven actually
[Music]

02:16:05.450 --> 02:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:08.450 --> 02:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
it specifically says degree requirements
 
02:16:11.089 --> 02:16:11.099 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
02:16:14.530 --> 02:16:14.540 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh
 
02:16:17.689 --> 02:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
ways and you pass the test you can ask a
 
02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman
 
02:16:23.689 --> 02:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
look I I just want to respond to some of
 
02:16:25.850 --> 02:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
the comments that were responding to me
 
02:16:27.589 --> 02:16:27.599 align:start position:0%
um and I appreciate the views of my
 
02:16:29.930 --> 02:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
colleagues most certainly and
 
02:16:33.049 --> 02:16:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
these these these points that are raised
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
here on this test if they are not
 
02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:39.169 align:start position:0%
here on this test if they are not
connected

02:16:39.169 --> 02:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
connected
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
to anything substantive uh whether it be
 
02:16:45.469 --> 02:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
in an additional course whether it be as
 
02:16:47.629 --> 02:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
part of the overall curriculum of a
 
02:16:47.639 --> 02:16:48.429 align:start position:0%
part of the overall curriculum of a
student

02:16:48.429 --> 02:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
they are simply factoids okay students
 
02:16:55.849 --> 02:16:55.859 align:start position:0%
will not retain them students will
 
02:16:58.250 --> 02:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
retain things they use and that are
 
02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
connected in a living way to their
 
02:17:04.429 --> 02:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
education that is not what is being
 
02:17:06.129 --> 02:17:06.139 align:start position:0%
proposed here
 
02:17:10.190 --> 02:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
and so what will happen is it will
 
02:17:13.849 --> 02:17:13.859 align:start position:0%
simply be an additional hurdle that a
 
02:17:16.250 --> 02:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
student needs to go through
 
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
they will simply have the answers next
 
02:17:21.770 --> 02:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
to them again I know how students
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
operate and in particularly in an online
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
environment where there is no particular
 
02:17:28.849 --> 02:17:28.859 align:start position:0%
vested interest on the part of the
 
02:17:31.150 --> 02:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
University or the college
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
to Proctor the exams or anything of the
 
02:17:34.559 --> 02:17:35.929 align:start position:0%
to Proctor the exams or anything of the
sort

02:17:35.929 --> 02:17:35.939 align:start position:0%
sort
 
02:17:37.610 --> 02:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
um and just let the student go ahead and
 
02:17:40.730 --> 02:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
take it this will not have anything and
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I would particularly I mean there
 
02:17:45.049 --> 02:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
were comments made that this is
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
um and points made that this is similar
 
02:17:49.790 --> 02:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
to an open book test or
 
02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
um it is
 
02:17:52.610 --> 02:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
um you know part of the total picture
 
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
and and yes it could be
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
but just simply giving the exam is not
 
02:18:02.049 --> 02:18:02.059 align:start position:0%
similar to an open book test in an exam
 
02:18:04.370 --> 02:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
I'm actually giving an exam tomorrow
 
02:18:06.650 --> 02:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
where my students can bring in in U.S
 
02:18:08.509 --> 02:18:08.519 align:start position:0%
history where they can bring in any
 
02:18:10.250 --> 02:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
notes that they want to bring on the
 
02:18:13.370 --> 02:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
exam sheet okay and so the process of
 
02:18:15.650 --> 02:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
having them develop their notes in
 
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
advance is helping them to learn okay
 
02:18:20.570 --> 02:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
but here the answers are already
 
02:18:23.629 --> 02:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
available it's all there it's all laid
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
out for them uh and so there will not be
 
02:18:30.589 --> 02:18:30.599 align:start position:0%
learning happening it just simply won't
 
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
and I I fear that what we are doing here
 
02:18:35.810 --> 02:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
is it's not even applying an effective
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid to a long-standing issue of a
 
02:18:42.049 --> 02:18:42.059 align:start position:0%
failure of civics now Civic Civic
 
02:18:44.929 --> 02:18:44.939 align:start position:0%
knowledge Civic awareness much more
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
useful would be having students go to
 
02:18:49.070 --> 02:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
town meetings much more useful would be
 
02:18:52.009 --> 02:18:52.019 align:start position:0%
having students engaged in particular
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
ways whether in the political process
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
um or you know how however but simply
 
02:19:00.469 --> 02:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
giving a task of 128 questions
 
02:19:02.929 --> 02:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
is not going to do it
 
02:19:05.690 --> 02:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid so again I have to reiterate
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:10.849 --> 02:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
um I think we're getting close to where
 
02:19:15.009 --> 02:19:15.019 align:start position:0%
we should start calling the role here
 
02:19:17.629 --> 02:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
02:19:19.849 --> 02:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
um something we haven't talked about and
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
there you know we did we didn't have
 
02:19:26.810 --> 02:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
substantial testimony on on 319 but the
 
02:19:28.969 --> 02:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
one that actually raised the the most
 
02:19:30.530 --> 02:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
significant concern
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
um to me was the representative from
 
02:19:37.549 --> 02:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
nachi who um who spoke to the um the
 
02:19:41.150 --> 02:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
institutions ability to to attain and
 
02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:42.429 align:start position:0%
institutions ability to to attain and
retain

02:19:42.429 --> 02:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
retain
 
02:19:42.439 --> 02:19:43.990 align:start position:0%
retain
certification

02:19:43.990 --> 02:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
certification
 
02:19:47.389 --> 02:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
requirement in view of um certain
 
02:19:49.610 --> 02:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements being prescribed
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
by legislators and legislatures and
 
02:19:56.570 --> 02:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
politicians and um and you know I you
 
02:19:58.550 --> 02:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
know she really she pointed that out as
 
02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
a is a very strong concern I think we're
 
02:20:02.450 --> 02:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
also probably going to have you know
 
02:20:04.849 --> 02:20:04.859 align:start position:0%
similar concerns when we when when the
 
02:20:07.330 --> 02:20:07.340 align:start position:0%
work group on the merger convenes on
 
02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:09.310 align:start position:0%
work group on the merger convenes on
tomorrow

02:20:09.310 --> 02:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
with respect to um to higher education
 
02:20:14.399 --> 02:20:15.250 align:start position:0%
with respect to um to higher education
um

02:20:15.250 --> 02:20:15.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:19.610 --> 02:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
accreditations and and I'm I guess I'm
 
02:20:21.710 --> 02:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
not sure what the I don't think the
 
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
amendment does anything to to address Ms
 
02:20:26.929 --> 02:20:26.939 align:start position:0%
O'Brien's um
 
02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
um concerns on this and and frankly I
 
02:20:33.290 --> 02:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
think um I I you know I
 
02:20:36.110 --> 02:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
I think I think we we as a committee
 
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
should be really sure about what the
 
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
what the accreditation impact would be
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
on our um on our University system on
 
02:20:46.130 --> 02:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
our community college system that I
 
02:20:48.469 --> 02:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
think work with in terms of matriculated
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
students and undergraduate and
 
02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
Associates and bachelor's programs
 
02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
probably is in the 50 to 60 000 student
 
02:20:56.040 --> 02:20:57.410 align:start position:0%
probably is in the 50 to 60 000 student
range

02:20:57.410 --> 02:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
range
 
02:21:00.290 --> 02:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
um Statewide so I think the impact could
 
02:21:03.530 --> 02:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
be potentially very very significant on
 
02:21:06.349 --> 02:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
not only the the number of students but
 
02:21:09.650 --> 02:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
on the um the certifications of these
 
02:21:09.660 --> 02:21:11.270 align:start position:0%
on the um the certifications of these
colleges

02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
02:21:13.370 --> 02:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
um and how the certifications
 
02:21:16.429 --> 02:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
you know also impact everything from up
 
02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
from you know Federal
 
02:21:18.359 --> 02:21:18.950 align:start position:0%
from you know Federal
um

02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
um uh Federal research grants and
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
everything else that's tied to
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
being a certified institution so so I
 
02:21:28.370 --> 02:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
just hope we're not moving forward
 
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
blindly um
 
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know on this on this really what
 
02:21:37.309 --> 02:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
what I think is a very important very
 
02:21:38.929 --> 02:21:38.939 align:start position:0%
significant bill
 
02:21:41.330 --> 02:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
um for our state institutions
 
02:21:44.510 --> 02:21:44.520 align:start position:0%

vote on the amendment first
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
we did because it I thought we changed
 
02:24:27.610 --> 02:24:27.620 align:start position:0%

okay so Professor moffatt will write the
 
02:24:58.330 --> 02:24:58.340 align:start position:0%
go ahead and not go ahead Professor Lynn
 
02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd love to see University
 
02:25:02.889 --> 02:25:02.899 align:start position:0%
have some
 
02:25:05.929 --> 02:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
discussion on this okay we're going to
 
02:25:07.730 --> 02:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
go to the next bill that's on the docket
 
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
today and it's hb441
 
02:25:14.570 --> 02:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
is requiring the universal declaration
 
02:25:17.870 --> 02:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
human rights to be placed in all public
 
02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:19.429 align:start position:0%
human rights to be placed in all public
schools

02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:25:21.770 --> 02:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
and with that I'd like to recognize
 
02:25:28.030 --> 02:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:30.349 --> 02:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion on the floor
 
02:25:34.250 --> 02:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
IPL on HP 441 made by reps in a bone and
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
second by representative Saudi uh
 
02:25:38.330 --> 02:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
represent Boone be care to speak to your
 
02:25:41.210 --> 02:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
motion yes this is a
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Human Rights done 70
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:25:47.929 --> 02:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
in some cases outdated
 
02:25:47.939 --> 02:25:50.090 align:start position:0%
in some cases outdated
and

02:25:50.090 --> 02:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:52.490 --> 02:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
if schools want to put it up they can
 
02:25:52.500 --> 02:25:54.110 align:start position:0%
if schools want to put it up they can
but

02:25:54.110 --> 02:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:25:56.990 --> 02:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
um the problem is there are some just
 
02:25:59.809 --> 02:25:59.819 align:start position:0%
because the country the United States is
 
02:26:01.610 --> 02:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
a member of the United Nations doesn't
 
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
mean we as citizens of the United States
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
a sovereign country should be subjected
 
02:26:13.790 --> 02:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
to any Declarations of a non-us agency a
 
02:26:17.389 --> 02:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
country or otherwise also at the last
 
02:26:20.570 --> 02:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
minute it's going to be a 28-day issue
 
02:26:23.929 --> 02:26:23.939 align:start position:0%
also even though the the Declarations
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
can be given free and whatnot they still
 
02:26:28.849 --> 02:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
have to be posted put up and maintained
 
02:26:33.730 --> 02:26:33.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:39.309 --> 02:26:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
and there's no such requirement
 
02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:50.950 align:start position:0%
and there's no such requirement
um

02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:53.889 --> 02:26:53.899 align:start position:0%
it's fine as a teaching tool
 
02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
but I find that this bill is a jumped
 
02:27:00.650 --> 02:27:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:06.889 --> 02:27:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:09.770 --> 02:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
are there any comments
 
02:27:12.889 --> 02:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
elsewhere within the committee
 
02:27:16.670 --> 02:27:16.680 align:start position:0%

so this bill
 
02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:47.809 align:start position:0%
so this bill
[Music]

02:30:47.809 --> 02:30:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:50.450 --> 02:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
of the United States
 
02:30:54.050 --> 02:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
display in school buildings and I
 
02:30:56.090 --> 02:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
believe there is appropriation in there
 
02:30:56.100 --> 02:30:57.170 align:start position:0%
believe there is appropriation in there
for

02:30:57.170 --> 02:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:30:57.180 --> 02:30:58.630 align:start position:0%
for
um

02:30:58.630 --> 02:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:01.870 --> 02:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
acceptance of donations so this
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
issue and it's not a requirement
 
02:31:06.479 --> 02:31:07.670 align:start position:0%
issue and it's not a requirement
s

02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
s
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:12.479 --> 02:31:13.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:31:13.730 --> 02:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:15.530 --> 02:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
represent like this
 
02:31:17.630 --> 02:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
yeah the difference between this bill
 
02:31:19.610 --> 02:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
and the previous one is the previous one
 
02:31:21.770 --> 02:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
was a mandate and this one is just in
 
02:31:21.780 --> 02:31:22.730 align:start position:0%
was a mandate and this one is just in
May

02:31:22.730 --> 02:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
May
 
02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
that's that's really the big difference
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:31.730 --> 02:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
representative uh Miler did you have
 
02:31:33.230 --> 02:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
02:31:36.530 --> 02:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
well I might as well sure thank you Mr
 
02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:37.370 align:start position:0%
well I might as well sure thank you Mr
chair

02:31:37.370 --> 02:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:31:40.969 --> 02:31:40.979 align:start position:0%
even though this is a May thing
 
02:31:44.270 --> 02:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
um it's it still is uh it's it's similar
 
02:31:49.450 --> 02:31:49.460 align:start position:0%
to the one we just we just uh put in uh
 
02:31:52.969 --> 02:31:52.979 align:start position:0%
itl I just don't understand why we're
 
02:31:55.849 --> 02:31:55.859 align:start position:0%
recommending to school districts to do
 
02:31:57.469 --> 02:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
these kinds of things I mean if they
 
02:31:59.090 --> 02:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
want to do it they can do it anyway now
 
02:32:01.309 --> 02:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
we're trying to put this in law that
 
02:32:03.530 --> 02:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
permits them to do that I just don't
 
02:32:06.050 --> 02:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary uh this is another
 
02:32:10.190 --> 02:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
another example of of uh of government
 
02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
overreach we hear that all the time so
 
02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:13.429 align:start position:0%
overreach we hear that all the time so
uh

02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:15.650 --> 02:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
absolutely I just disagree with this the
 
02:32:19.309 --> 02:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
other thing is that this is our motto
 
02:32:22.010 --> 02:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
that was that was placed in and in some
 
02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:23.150 align:start position:0%
that was that was placed in and in some
people

02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:32:26.150 --> 02:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
they don't believe in God
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
and this purpose Unum was our original
 
02:32:31.790 --> 02:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
motto which we should have kept to begin
 
02:32:31.800 --> 02:32:32.809 align:start position:0%
motto which we should have kept to begin
with

02:32:32.809 --> 02:32:32.819 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:32:34.910 --> 02:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
but that's not where we are right now so
 
02:32:36.590 --> 02:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
I just think it's I just think it's not
 
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you uh representative uh
 
02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:42.770 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you uh representative uh
crayon

02:32:42.770 --> 02:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
crayon
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you the one of the other
 
02:32:47.030 --> 02:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
important differences here is that this
 
02:32:49.610 --> 02:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
is the United States motto and we were
 
02:32:51.250 --> 02:32:51.260 align:start position:0%
talking about the United Nations
 
02:32:53.630 --> 02:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
declaration I believe that that
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:59.450 --> 02:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
she reps on woodcock
 
02:33:02.090 --> 02:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I'd like to speak
 
02:33:03.230 --> 02:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
to this again
 
02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
um as they did in the hearing
 
02:33:08.929 --> 02:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
um hb69 it's not a bill that's needed
 
02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
it wasn't needed last session if you
 
02:33:14.570 --> 02:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
recall it was done exactly on this day
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
last of March 11th
 
02:33:19.130 --> 02:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't needed then it's not needed
 
02:33:19.140 --> 02:33:20.270 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't needed then it's not needed
today

02:33:20.270 --> 02:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't change when I order a
 
02:33:25.969 --> 02:33:25.979 align:start position:0%
thing today it can't already happen
 
02:33:28.130 --> 02:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
and I quote from the bill the school
 
02:33:30.650 --> 02:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
board May provide and later on I said
 
02:33:32.590 --> 02:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
the school board May accept yada yada
 
02:33:34.910 --> 02:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
last year representative Ladd and I
 
02:33:39.410 --> 02:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
quote you said this bill does nothing
 
02:33:41.150 --> 02:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
and he was right then and you're right
 
02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:41.990 align:start position:0%
and he was right then and you're right
now

02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:33:44.510 --> 02:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
from a legislative point of view why are
 
02:33:46.809 --> 02:33:46.819 align:start position:0%
we making all the law that says nothing
 
02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
requires nothing does nothing
 
02:33:51.770 --> 02:33:51.780 align:start position:0%
I mean moving beyond this this
 
02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
legislative foolishness if you will I
 
02:33:55.309 --> 02:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
break through the Elijah point that
 
02:33:57.410 --> 02:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative uh Dr Ladd talked about
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
the other day this isn't 1956 when
 
02:34:03.410 --> 02:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
President Eisenhower in concert with by
 
02:34:06.050 --> 02:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
the way Billy Graham worked together to
 
02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
make Christianity and patriotism into
 
02:34:09.950 --> 02:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
this weapon against the uh Godless
 
02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:12.170 align:start position:0%
this weapon against the uh Godless
communists

02:34:12.170 --> 02:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
communists
 
02:34:13.790 --> 02:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
and please don't think of my lack of
 
02:34:15.290 --> 02:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
support for this bill comes from my
 
02:34:17.750 --> 02:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
place my lack of personal patriotism or
 
02:34:20.809 --> 02:34:20.819 align:start position:0%
my non-belief in God that's not the case
 
02:34:23.210 --> 02:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
I'm a proud Army veteran I'm Deacon in
 
02:34:25.250 --> 02:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
my church so that's irrelevant to the
 
02:34:25.260 --> 02:34:26.090 align:start position:0%
my church so that's irrelevant to the
topic

02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
topic
 
02:34:29.410 --> 02:34:29.420 align:start position:0%
our personal beliefs yours and mine
 
02:34:33.290 --> 02:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
should not dictate school policy today
 
02:34:38.270 --> 02:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
is 2021. many of us outside our door our
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
house door especially during mud season
 
02:34:44.090 --> 02:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
when you may have a mat that says
 
02:34:44.100 --> 02:34:45.110 align:start position:0%
when you may have a mat that says
welcome

02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
02:34:47.570 --> 02:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
the math does two things it keeps the
 
02:34:49.010 --> 02:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
mud out of the house if you live in the
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
North country and it allows your friends
 
02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
to be welcome to your home
 
02:34:56.090 --> 02:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
using a similar if you will education
 
02:35:00.170 --> 02:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
metaphor for schools are the homes and
 
02:35:02.750 --> 02:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
the students are our guests but by
 
02:35:05.450 --> 02:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
putting the national motto in God we
 
02:35:08.210 --> 02:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
trust at the front of the school it does
 
02:35:10.969 --> 02:35:10.979 align:start position:0%
not present a welcome sign it actually
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
says you're not welcome here
 
02:35:16.309 --> 02:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
you may say to whom you may ask is the
 
02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
sign to not welcoming and I say to all
 
02:35:22.130 --> 02:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
of us students and their parents and
 
02:35:24.410 --> 02:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
visitors that don't necessarily hold the
 
02:35:26.690 --> 02:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
same judio Christian beliefs that you
 
02:35:28.190 --> 02:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
and I may have
 
02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
think of the population of children in
 
02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
the backgrounds that they bring to the
 
02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
schools today in 2021 this is not the
 
02:35:39.650 --> 02:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
same demographic as 1956.
 
02:35:42.410 --> 02:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
as representative Mila said maybe it's
 
02:35:44.090 --> 02:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
time to recall the national model that
 
02:35:47.929 --> 02:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
was established in 1782 out of one in
 
02:35:52.010 --> 02:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
many that fits in 2021 and I'd go on
 
02:35:54.230 --> 02:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
record asking him to reject this bill on
 
02:35:57.170 --> 02:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
it yell it thank you thank you very much
 
02:36:00.469 --> 02:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh representative you're hands up yes
 
02:36:02.090 --> 02:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
um if part one was the only thing that
 
02:36:07.250 --> 02:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
was in this I would say yes it does
 
02:36:09.770 --> 02:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
nothing and there's no point in it but
 
02:36:12.770 --> 02:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
part two bait is the protection of the
 
02:36:15.290 --> 02:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
school who does choose to put this up I
 
02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if any schools will but if
 
02:36:18.830 --> 02:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
they do
 
02:36:21.770 --> 02:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
part two is the important part is that
 
02:36:23.809 --> 02:36:23.819 align:start position:0%
the Office of the Attorney General shall
 
02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
defend the display so we're trying to
 
02:36:30.170 --> 02:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
shortcut any lawsuits that may happen
 
02:36:34.010 --> 02:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
should a school decide to do this
 
02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:34.870 align:start position:0%
should a school decide to do this
um

02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:38.690 --> 02:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
and say yes they definitely are still
 
02:36:38.700 --> 02:36:40.190 align:start position:0%
and say yes they definitely are still
allowed

02:36:40.190 --> 02:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
02:36:42.050 --> 02:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that any schools will
 
02:36:46.610 --> 02:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
but I will say after 9 11. many schools
 
02:36:49.910 --> 02:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
on their big bull bar Billboards said In
 
02:36:52.309 --> 02:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
God We Trust so
 
02:36:54.410 --> 02:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
um they may and this
 
02:36:57.349 --> 02:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
part two is the important it says that
 
02:36:59.929 --> 02:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
yes and they will be defended for doing
 
02:37:02.050 --> 02:37:02.060 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:08.570 --> 02:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
clarified with uh representative said
 
02:37:11.389 --> 02:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
that our school on 9 11.
 
02:37:15.650 --> 02:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
uh 20 years ago right after it all the
 
02:37:17.870 --> 02:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
big bubbles and all three of our schools
 
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
outside had and God we trust on them
 
02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
nobody told them to do it they did it on
 
02:37:24.889 --> 02:37:24.899 align:start position:0%
their own so
 
02:37:27.710 --> 02:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
this says hey if you do it now you're
 
02:37:30.710 --> 02:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
further further Comics representative
 
02:37:35.929 --> 02:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:37:38.809 --> 02:37:38.819 align:start position:0%
my question is who protects and defends
 
02:37:40.490 --> 02:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
the interests of the students who don't
 
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
believe in God I personally do not
 
02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
believe in the judeo-christian God I do
 
02:37:47.150 --> 02:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
not accept that
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
um my children do not believe yet they
 
02:37:52.130 --> 02:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
attended public school and if this sign
 
02:37:54.349 --> 02:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
is out front what does it say to my
 
02:37:54.359 --> 02:37:55.550 align:start position:0%
is out front what does it say to my
children

02:37:55.550 --> 02:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:37:58.250 --> 02:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
what does it say to them
 
02:37:59.450 --> 02:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:03.550 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
um

02:38:03.550 --> 02:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
representation yeah I representative
 
02:38:11.570 --> 02:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
Wade just said uh uh basically what what
 
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
I was thinking is that
 
02:38:19.929 --> 02:38:19.939 align:start position:0%
um I I think that that this is isolating
 
02:38:22.330 --> 02:38:22.340 align:start position:0%
students who
 
02:38:25.309 --> 02:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
believe in a different religion it might
 
02:38:28.309 --> 02:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
still be God but
 
02:38:30.830 --> 02:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
um they don't recognize it in that name
 
02:38:33.230 --> 02:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
or whatever and I think we're we're
 
02:38:35.690 --> 02:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
singling out
 
02:38:35.700 --> 02:38:36.230 align:start position:0%
singling out
um

02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
children by by
 
02:38:42.050 --> 02:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
having this in the schools I think if
 
02:38:43.849 --> 02:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
they want to put it up as an
 
02:38:46.849 --> 02:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
informational thing as part of a you
 
02:38:50.090 --> 02:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
know historical uh display with you know
 
02:38:52.910 --> 02:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
mottos and documents and things like
 
02:38:56.809 --> 02:38:56.819 align:start position:0%
that but to just have it displayed as
 
02:38:59.630 --> 02:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
like here's you put something like that
 
02:39:02.650 --> 02:39:02.660 align:start position:0%
in a school on display it means that
 
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
this is what you live by and and I just
 
02:39:10.010 --> 02:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
think it's out of place and and uh I
 
02:39:12.170 --> 02:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
would definitely disagree with the
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
thought to pass on this
 
02:39:17.210 --> 02:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
further comments represent what talk to
 
02:39:19.550 --> 02:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
your hands up yeah and one just uh just
 
02:39:21.170 --> 02:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
to address the comments have made
 
02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative very quickly no one's
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
suggesting no one is suggesting that
 
02:39:27.410 --> 02:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
it's illegal we're not suggesting that
 
02:39:31.010 --> 02:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
at all it is legal part two just says if
 
02:39:32.929 --> 02:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
someone takes you to court the state
 
02:39:35.270 --> 02:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
will pay the money so that's all it says
 
02:39:36.770 --> 02:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
the state will come to you and pay the
 
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill it is legal that's not the question
 
02:39:41.510 --> 02:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem it's not moral and
 
02:39:43.849 --> 02:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
it's not welcoming
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:39:52.690 --> 02:39:52.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:56.389 --> 02:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh sorry do you have a comment yeah
 
02:39:56.399 --> 02:39:58.750 align:start position:0%
uh sorry do you have a comment yeah
um

02:39:58.750 --> 02:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:01.849 --> 02:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
well it's just like it's just being said
 
02:40:01.859 --> 02:40:09.770 align:start position:0%
well it's just like it's just being said
yes

02:40:09.770 --> 02:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:14.090 --> 02:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:16.250 --> 02:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
02:40:19.429 --> 02:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
yeah in much the same fashion that when
 
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
somebody sneezes and you say bless you
 
02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
are you endorsing God in that statement
 
02:40:26.750 --> 02:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
you're more or less endorsing the
 
02:40:28.730 --> 02:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
culture that you're in
 
02:40:31.250 --> 02:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't necessarily mean that
 
02:40:34.190 --> 02:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's God that you're endorsing
 
02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
you're endorsing the establishment of
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
the culture that you're in
 
02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't feel that uh
 
02:40:42.170 --> 02:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
it would bother people who are atheist
 
02:40:45.290 --> 02:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:47.510 --> 02:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
um that's basically it thank you very
 
02:40:50.330 --> 02:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:52.610 --> 02:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and my little hand raising
 
02:40:55.550 --> 02:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
thing on the on the panelist uh board
 
02:40:57.830 --> 02:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
isn't working so that's why I'm waving
 
02:40:57.840 --> 02:40:59.389 align:start position:0%
isn't working so that's why I'm waving
madly

02:40:59.389 --> 02:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
madly
 
02:41:01.370 --> 02:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
um I agree with uh what people have said
 
02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
about how it it is it makes schools a
 
02:41:06.469 --> 02:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
little bit less than welcoming
 
02:41:08.690 --> 02:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
um for all people and I think that's
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's an important part of our public
 
02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
schools that we open to everybody that
 
02:41:16.429 --> 02:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
we uh recognize their culture and that
 
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
we um we don't uh try to intimidate them
 
02:41:22.490 --> 02:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
in some way which I think some people
 
02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
would find this intimidating I I also
 
02:41:28.969 --> 02:41:28.979 align:start position:0%
think that the fact that we have that
 
02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
that uh part of the law that are part of
 
02:41:35.330 --> 02:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
this bill that says that um the state's
 
02:41:37.330 --> 02:41:37.340 align:start position:0%
going to pick up the tab if you get sued
 
02:41:39.650 --> 02:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
indicates that this is a contentious
 
02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
issue that that uh putting it out there
 
02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
is going to mean that it's going to
 
02:41:47.690 --> 02:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
offend some people and some people are
 
02:41:49.490 --> 02:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
um anxious about it and some people are
 
02:41:56.270 --> 02:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
going to uh create the diversion by it
 
02:41:58.969 --> 02:41:58.979 align:start position:0%
or or they'll they may not take it to
 
02:42:00.889 --> 02:42:00.899 align:start position:0%
court but they they may bring it to the
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
school board and is that really what we
 
02:42:06.710 --> 02:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
want to encourage at this point in our
 
02:42:09.190 --> 02:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
nation when we have so much
 
02:42:12.889 --> 02:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
division right now to put some red flag
 
02:42:15.410 --> 02:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
in front of some people I I just find
 
02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:16.490 align:start position:0%
in front of some people I I just find
that

02:42:16.490 --> 02:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:17.270 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:42:17.270 --> 02:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:20.450 --> 02:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
not what I want to do thank you thank
 
02:42:22.730 --> 02:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
you very much uh representative uh
 
02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:24.050 align:start position:0%
you very much uh representative uh
Andrus

02:42:24.050 --> 02:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
Andrus
 
02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh according to what I have read and
 
02:42:28.670 --> 02:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
this is I have it right in front of me
 
02:42:31.030 --> 02:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
right now back in 2018
 
02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
Florida was one of seven states that
 
02:42:36.349 --> 02:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
passed laws requiring or permitting
 
02:42:39.050 --> 02:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
schools and other public buildings to
 
02:42:43.070 --> 02:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
post and God we trust and so this issue
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
that we have right before us I realize
 
02:42:48.170 --> 02:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
is pros and cons but it's not a new
 
02:42:50.030 --> 02:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
thing they've passed laws in other
 
02:42:53.410 --> 02:42:53.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:56.870 --> 02:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and um you
 
02:42:58.790 --> 02:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
know I agree with a lot of what's been
 
02:43:02.210 --> 02:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
been said um I do think however that
 
02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives Lucas and Tanner really
 
02:43:06.770 --> 02:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
sort of got to the um got to the point
 
02:43:10.610 --> 02:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
on this where um where you know Roman 1
 
02:43:13.070 --> 02:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
let some Deuce you know says they can do
 
02:43:14.630 --> 02:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
something that they already have you
 
02:43:16.250 --> 02:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
know they can do
 
02:43:18.830 --> 02:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
um but Roman 2 puts the Attorney General
 
02:43:21.410 --> 02:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
in a very unique position the Attorney
 
02:43:25.730 --> 02:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
General normally can choose what um laws
 
02:43:28.370 --> 02:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
to defend or not and this puts the
 
02:43:30.530 --> 02:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
Attorney General in a position where
 
02:43:34.130 --> 02:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
they shall defend the uh the display and
 
02:43:36.650 --> 02:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
um and on other bills
 
02:43:40.849 --> 02:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
that I've seen where a um now a mandate
 
02:43:43.969 --> 02:43:43.979 align:start position:0%
is placed upon a department we've we've
 
02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
seen fiscal notes
 
02:43:47.270 --> 02:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
um on that
 
02:43:49.130 --> 02:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
um I mean there was talk earlier this
 
02:43:51.170 --> 02:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
week I think about a fiscal note for a
 
02:43:52.969 --> 02:43:52.979 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollar thing and I think
 
02:43:56.270 --> 02:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's pales in comparison to what um to
 
02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
what a a defense
 
02:44:02.570 --> 02:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
could be and um and I think this is
 
02:44:05.090 --> 02:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
probably a very good example of a bill
 
02:44:07.550 --> 02:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
where where we should seek
 
02:44:10.730 --> 02:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
um a fiscal note from the LBA and get
 
02:44:12.650 --> 02:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
some get some input from the Department
 
02:44:15.290 --> 02:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
of Justice in terms of what this would
 
02:44:17.690 --> 02:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
be what this would would require in
 
02:44:20.210 --> 02:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
terms of in terms of Defending a school
 
02:44:22.670 --> 02:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
district on this because I think as as
 
02:44:25.550 --> 02:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
many people have said and I think uh on
 
02:44:28.429 --> 02:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
on all sides of this issue that it's a
 
02:44:31.070 --> 02:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
contentious issue and uh and certainly
 
02:44:34.190 --> 02:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
will spark a um a lawsuit in any
 
02:44:37.010 --> 02:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
District that does it AG will be on the
 
02:44:39.170 --> 02:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
hook to uh to defend the school district
 
02:44:42.349 --> 02:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
I think we should know what the cost is
 
02:44:45.050 --> 02:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
02:44:45.060 --> 02:44:46.070 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
Holland

02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
Holland
 
02:44:49.130 --> 02:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for recognizing me
 
02:44:49.140 --> 02:44:50.210 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for recognizing me
um

02:44:50.210 --> 02:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:53.030 --> 02:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
I had the same reaction to reading this
 
02:44:55.550 --> 02:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
bill that I did when I read uh the
 
02:45:01.090 --> 02:45:01.100 align:start position:0%
previous Bill 441 and that was that I
 
02:45:07.730 --> 02:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
for saw my constituents being upset if I
 
02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
voted in favor of the bill
 
02:45:12.530 --> 02:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
and I say that universally whether it
 
02:45:15.349 --> 02:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
was the human rights thing or In God We
 
02:45:17.690 --> 02:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
Trust I looked at both of those bills
 
02:45:20.929 --> 02:45:20.939 align:start position:0%
and thought if I vote in favor of these
 
02:45:23.030 --> 02:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
bills I am going to have constituents
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
that are going to be really upset over
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
the divisiveness of the bill
 
02:45:32.349 --> 02:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
and so I uh respectfully chose to vote
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
with the uh the motion on the the itl
 
02:45:38.809 --> 02:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
motion on the Human Rights bill
 
02:45:42.349 --> 02:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
um I I have to say that I feel that in
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
voting against
 
02:45:46.070 --> 02:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this I want to make it
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear that it does not reflect
 
02:45:52.849 --> 02:45:52.859 align:start position:0%
my own personal beliefs uh in God or not
 
02:45:56.990 --> 02:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
what it reflects is my respect for all
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
of my constituents thank you
 
02:46:04.429 --> 02:46:04.439 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Leon
 
02:46:07.610 --> 02:46:07.620 align:start position:0%

02:46:07.620 --> 02:46:30.349 align:start position:0%
no represent Hobson excuse me
um

02:46:30.349 --> 02:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:32.450 --> 02:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
brings people
 
02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
with the spirit of being united as the
 
02:46:38.090 --> 02:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
United States citizens
 
02:46:40.370 --> 02:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:46:42.490 --> 02:46:42.500 align:start position:0%
we all come from different
 
02:46:45.710 --> 02:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
countries we all have Heritage in
 
02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
different countries
 
02:46:51.770 --> 02:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
of reading that the United States style
 
02:46:51.780 --> 02:46:53.230 align:start position:0%
of reading that the United States style
is

02:46:53.230 --> 02:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:46:58.969 --> 02:46:58.979 align:start position:0%
us together it makes us more of life
 
02:47:02.030 --> 02:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh so I just I just wanted to add that
 
02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:06.770 align:start position:0%
uh so I just I just wanted to add that
um

02:47:06.770 --> 02:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
for example that I think that schools
 
02:47:13.849 --> 02:47:13.859 align:start position:0%
if they are confronted with uh
 
02:47:15.530 --> 02:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
constituents that are uncomfortable with
 
02:47:18.530 --> 02:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
this most likely would not put it up
 
02:47:21.250 --> 02:47:21.260 align:start position:0%
if they want to
 
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
welcome to and this is amazing
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%

our money says In God We Trust which we
 
02:47:38.270 --> 02:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
handle all the time and
 
02:47:40.610 --> 02:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
um I haven't seen any lawsuits or upset
 
02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
or people not wanting to handle money
 
02:47:44.990 --> 02:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
because they're atheists and it says In
 
02:47:47.690 --> 02:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
God We Trust so it is our state motto
 
02:47:49.969 --> 02:47:49.979 align:start position:0%
and it is on our money I mean our
 
02:47:53.570 --> 02:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
federal motto and it is thank you
 
02:47:58.130 --> 02:47:58.140 align:start position:0%

recommendation
 
02:49:54.950 --> 02:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
um both sides will need to to author a
 
02:49:57.050 --> 02:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
report yeah right that's what we're
 
02:49:58.849 --> 02:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
preparing right
 
02:50:01.929 --> 02:50:01.939 align:start position:0%
a statement yes thank you
 
02:50:05.389 --> 02:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
you're ready to report yeah and we're
 
02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
writing the other representative Tanner
 
02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:15.349 --> 02:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay I think what we're going to do is
 
02:50:18.490 --> 02:50:18.500 align:start position:0%
because the lob time says we're
 
02:50:21.050 --> 02:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
approaching 12 o'clock here
 
02:50:23.150 --> 02:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
so what we're going to do is we're going
 
02:50:24.770 --> 02:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
to take a break here
 
02:50:24.780 --> 02:50:26.389 align:start position:0%
to take a break here
and

02:50:26.389 --> 02:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:28.849 --> 02:50:28.859 align:start position:0%
uh we're gonna come back here let's say
 
02:50:30.950 --> 02:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
in 45 minutes is that good enough
 
02:50:33.170 --> 02:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
anybody need more than that I think that
 
02:50:34.849 --> 02:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
should be apple
 
02:50:34.859 --> 02:50:36.070 align:start position:0%
should be apple
um

02:50:36.070 --> 02:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:38.690 --> 02:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
you could give us a specific time just
 
02:50:40.730 --> 02:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
because I I'm not I don't trust the lob
 
02:50:43.370 --> 02:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
is quite on the same time as like the
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
computers here I'm showing 1153 right
 
02:50:49.010 --> 02:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
now what is the clock there say uh so
 
02:50:51.050 --> 02:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to say to you that that
 
02:50:55.429 --> 02:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
obviously 12 45. thank you thank you
 
02:51:05.210 --> 02:51:05.220 align:start position:0%

thank you very much thank you
 
03:44:53.389 --> 03:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad yes yes it appears
 
03:44:55.130 --> 03:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
as he moves back and forth from the
 
03:44:56.630 --> 03:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
microphone that's what's happening
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
instead of just being right there he's
 
03:44:57.840 --> 03:44:59.090 align:start position:0%
instead of just being right there he's
moving

03:44:59.090 --> 03:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
moving
 
03:45:01.070 --> 03:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
so what it is we have one of these
 
03:45:02.929 --> 03:45:02.939 align:start position:0%
lights that's on the top of the desk
 
03:45:04.910 --> 03:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
here and it's aimed at me and not
 
03:45:08.750 --> 03:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
towards him I don't know
 
03:45:13.790 --> 03:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:16.729 --> 03:45:16.739 align:start position:0%
all right so just to repeat the motion
 
03:45:21.410 --> 03:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass and uh this bill is
 
03:45:24.950 --> 03:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
intended to level the playing field in
 
03:45:29.030 --> 03:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
due process hearings and put the burden
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
of proof on the school district
 
03:45:34.490 --> 03:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
they have the resources
 
03:45:36.950 --> 03:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh they have the lawyers
 
03:45:36.960 --> 03:45:37.910 align:start position:0%
uh they have the lawyers
um

03:45:37.910 --> 03:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:40.309 --> 03:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
where now installed
 
03:45:44.030 --> 03:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
parents have to pay in case in some in
 
03:45:46.490 --> 03:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
many cases uh twenty thousand dollars
 
03:45:49.849 --> 03:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
enough if they want to take a case to uh
 
03:45:54.349 --> 03:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
due process hearing this will level the
 
03:45:56.809 --> 03:45:56.819 align:start position:0%
playing field and I think we owe it to
 
03:45:59.389 --> 03:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
the parents of children with special
 
03:46:02.269 --> 03:46:02.279 align:start position:0%
needs to make sure that they get a fair
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
hearing as to the services that are
 
03:46:08.269 --> 03:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
needed by their children which is
 
03:46:26.769 --> 03:46:26.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:28.729 --> 03:46:28.739 align:start position:0%

Myler uh representative
 
03:47:51.550 --> 03:47:51.560 align:start position:0%
I would thank you very much Mr chair
 
03:47:57.250 --> 03:47:57.260 align:start position:0%
okay so full transparency on this
 
03:48:01.250 --> 03:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
I have gone back and forth back and
 
03:48:03.769 --> 03:48:03.779 align:start position:0%
forth back and forth between the two
 
03:48:06.710 --> 03:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
positions on this bill uh so many times
 
03:48:09.110 --> 03:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
that I have not only driven myself crazy
 
03:48:11.210 --> 03:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
I've probably driven my colleagues crazy
 
03:48:14.630 --> 03:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
too because I've talked about it so much
 
03:48:14.640 --> 03:48:15.469 align:start position:0%
too because I've talked about it so much
um

03:48:15.469 --> 03:48:15.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:18.550 --> 03:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
there is I believe that there is Merit
 
03:48:22.250 --> 03:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
in all positions on this this particular
 
03:48:28.370 --> 03:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
topic but I am not sure that everybody
 
03:48:31.490 --> 03:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
um has an equal understanding of the
 
03:48:33.650 --> 03:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
processes that go on at the Department
 
03:48:35.330 --> 03:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
of Education
 
03:48:39.170 --> 03:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure myself that I understand
 
03:48:42.170 --> 03:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
both the intended and unintended
 
03:48:44.750 --> 03:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
consequences of changing the burden of
 
03:48:48.769 --> 03:48:48.779 align:start position:0%
proof and so uh this amendment seeks to
 
03:48:51.050 --> 03:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
turn the bill into a study committee
 
03:48:54.110 --> 03:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
that would do three things
 
03:48:58.070 --> 03:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
first it would give us time via the
 
03:48:59.990 --> 03:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
study committee and then the report of
 
03:49:01.969 --> 03:49:01.979 align:start position:0%
the study committee back to the full
 
03:49:05.769 --> 03:49:05.779 align:start position:0%
committee to familiarize uh everyone
 
03:49:09.229 --> 03:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
with the extent and the depth of the
 
03:49:11.510 --> 03:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
processes that currently exist at the
 
03:49:14.750 --> 03:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
doe for dispute resolution
 
03:49:18.229 --> 03:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
the second thing that it would do is uh
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
allow us an opportunity to examine the
 
03:49:25.190 --> 03:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
processes the responsibilities and the
 
03:49:27.590 --> 03:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
potential outcomes of Shifting the
 
03:49:30.469 --> 03:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
burden of proof from the school district
 
03:49:34.490 --> 03:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
where it excuse me from the the
 
03:49:37.729 --> 03:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
presenting party it actually the burden
 
03:49:39.710 --> 03:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
of proof belongs to whoever is bringing
 
03:49:43.969 --> 03:49:43.979 align:start position:0%
the case but uh 581 would shift that
 
03:49:47.090 --> 03:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
burden to the school district and I'm
 
03:49:48.889 --> 03:49:48.899 align:start position:0%
not sure that we have
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
I certainly have not had adequate time
 
03:49:56.090 --> 03:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
to convince myself that I know uh what
 
03:49:58.550 --> 03:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
the intended and unintended consequences
 
03:50:01.130 --> 03:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
would be and then based upon the
 
03:50:03.170 --> 03:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
findings of that I think we will be in a
 
03:50:05.809 --> 03:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
position to recommend uh legislation
 
03:50:07.610 --> 03:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
moving forward should we decide that
 
03:50:09.290 --> 03:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
we're going to change things
 
03:50:13.790 --> 03:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
so uh that is my Amendment and I would
 
03:50:16.910 --> 03:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions to answer to
 
03:50:20.769 --> 03:50:20.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:25.250 --> 03:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
yes thank you there is no doubt that
 
03:50:26.870 --> 03:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
there is a breakdown
 
03:50:31.309 --> 03:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line because things
 
03:50:32.929 --> 03:50:32.939 align:start position:0%
are in place
 
03:50:36.349 --> 03:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
but parents are not getting the services
 
03:50:38.510 --> 03:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
their children aren't getting the
 
03:50:41.510 --> 03:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
services there's a breakdown somewhere
 
03:50:46.190 --> 03:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
along the way and I think that studying
 
03:50:46.200 --> 03:50:47.530 align:start position:0%
along the way and I think that studying
this

03:50:47.530 --> 03:50:47.540 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:50:50.150 --> 03:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
what really
 
03:50:53.870 --> 03:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
bring the final result which would be of
 
03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
the best interest of
 
03:50:59.990 --> 03:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
the parents because this is needed
 
03:51:04.309 --> 03:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
but there's a breakdown somewhat
 
03:51:08.030 --> 03:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
and it's basically at the local level
 
03:51:11.690 --> 03:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be there needs to be a
 
03:51:13.370 --> 03:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
coordinated effort
 
03:51:15.830 --> 03:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
to bring all this information to the
 
03:51:18.650 --> 03:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
parents and to help them
 
03:51:21.889 --> 03:51:21.899 align:start position:0%
to get through it it shouldn't be well
 
03:51:25.429 --> 03:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
you know here's the rules you know this
 
03:51:27.110 --> 03:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
is the way it goes
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
generic iups things like that that's
 
03:51:30.239 --> 03:51:31.309 align:start position:0%
generic iups things like that that's
wrong

03:51:31.309 --> 03:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
03:51:36.309 --> 03:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a a distinct process
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
and I think that the burden of proof
 
03:51:44.690 --> 03:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
should definitely be on the uh the
 
03:51:48.530 --> 03:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
school district or the uh
 
03:51:52.370 --> 03:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
um or the uh Doe
 
03:51:55.370 --> 03:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
and not on the parents but there needs
 
03:51:57.889 --> 03:51:57.899 align:start position:0%
to be more education for the parents
 
03:52:01.370 --> 03:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
into their process and what they have in
 
03:52:02.450 --> 03:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
front of them they shouldn't be
 
03:52:05.450 --> 03:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
intimidated they shouldn't be
 
03:52:08.410 --> 03:52:08.420 align:start position:0%
um expected to know all this legal stuff
 
03:52:11.389 --> 03:52:11.399 align:start position:0%
and and they shouldn't have to get a
 
03:52:11.399 --> 03:52:12.530 align:start position:0%
and and they shouldn't have to get a
lawyer

03:52:12.530 --> 03:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
03:52:14.750 --> 03:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
so there's definitely a breakdown and
 
03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
maybe this is the answer is is to have a
 
03:52:19.130 --> 03:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
03:52:20.750 --> 03:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:20.760 --> 03:52:29.630 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

03:52:29.630 --> 03:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:32.450 --> 03:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
okay yes go ahead I'm sorry
 
03:52:32.460 --> 03:52:33.729 align:start position:0%
okay yes go ahead I'm sorry
um

03:52:33.729 --> 03:52:33.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:37.969 --> 03:52:37.979 align:start position:0%
if I do want to offer the opportunity to
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
the paper the second who second that
 
03:52:42.769 --> 03:52:42.779 align:start position:0%
motion right if you're not going to be
 
03:52:44.330 --> 03:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
asking a question directly I'll
 
03:52:45.889 --> 03:52:45.899 align:start position:0%
represent loan that I want to have
 
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
President Miler have a chance to think
 
03:52:52.969 --> 03:52:52.979 align:start position:0%
that second decision thank you very much
 
03:52:52.979 --> 03:52:56.090 align:start position:0%
that second decision thank you very much
representative

03:52:56.090 --> 03:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:59.690 --> 03:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would concur
 
03:53:02.590 --> 03:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
with uh president mullen's comment about
 
03:53:04.610 --> 03:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
the emotion
 
03:53:08.809 --> 03:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
and the issues that are with this uh
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt in my mind that uh
 
03:53:15.290 --> 03:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
that parents need to have the greatest
 
03:53:18.229 --> 03:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to advocate for their child
 
03:53:20.929 --> 03:53:20.939 align:start position:0%
if in fact the school they feel the
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
school district is uh in air as it
 
03:53:27.170 --> 03:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
relates to the uh programs that the
 
03:53:30.110 --> 03:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
they've uh they've proposed for their
 
03:53:30.120 --> 03:53:31.010 align:start position:0%
they've uh they've proposed for their
child

03:53:31.010 --> 03:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:53:32.990 --> 03:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
but here's the issue
 
03:53:35.990 --> 03:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
by the time you get to a due process
 
03:53:38.330 --> 03:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
hearing it's too late
 
03:53:40.729 --> 03:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
it's taken too much time
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
to get to that process
 
03:53:44.809 --> 03:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
well perhaps some members of the
 
03:53:47.450 --> 03:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
committee don't realize there is a whole
 
03:53:50.410 --> 03:53:50.420 align:start position:0%
process that takes place
 
03:53:53.269 --> 03:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
prior to getting to the due process
 
03:53:55.969 --> 03:53:55.979 align:start position:0%
hearing there's mediation sessions
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
there's IEP meetings in fact in this
 
03:54:01.250 --> 03:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
state we're one of the only States in
 
03:54:04.490 --> 03:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
which this state the parent has to sign
 
03:54:08.750 --> 03:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
off on an IEP program for their child
 
03:54:10.790 --> 03:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
other states don't do that the school
 
03:54:11.929 --> 03:54:11.939 align:start position:0%
district has
 
03:54:14.210 --> 03:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
total control over that we don't do that
 
03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
in this state we have we have taken
 
03:54:18.650 --> 03:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
pride in this state
 
03:54:21.469 --> 03:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
in dealing with special education needs
 
03:54:23.450 --> 03:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
to students
 
03:54:27.469 --> 03:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
and that process is very intimate that
 
03:54:30.910 --> 03:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
moves along various ways in fact the the
 
03:54:34.969 --> 03:54:34.979 align:start position:0%
disability Center has a thick book that
 
03:54:38.269 --> 03:54:38.279 align:start position:0%
talks about how this is done now
 
03:54:41.389 --> 03:54:41.399 align:start position:0%
my point is by the time you get to the
 
03:54:44.150 --> 03:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
due process hearing it's too late for
 
03:54:45.950 --> 03:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
that child
 
03:54:48.590 --> 03:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line
 
03:54:51.170 --> 03:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a much more immediate
 
03:54:51.180 --> 03:54:52.490 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a much more immediate
look

03:54:52.490 --> 03:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
look
 
03:54:54.650 --> 03:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
at how the school district and the
 
03:54:56.990 --> 03:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
parents can resolve any kind of a
 
03:54:59.689 --> 03:54:59.699 align:start position:0%
dispute don't forget when we had
 
03:55:02.210 --> 03:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
testimony that there are not many due
 
03:55:05.330 --> 03:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:07.729 --> 03:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
because the school district wants to try
 
03:55:09.950 --> 03:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
to solve these problems at the lowest
 
03:55:12.490 --> 03:55:12.500 align:start position:0%
level of that process
 
03:55:15.349 --> 03:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative Mullins Amendment
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
my hope would be in it if it's past is
 
03:55:21.110 --> 03:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
that we could deal with those lower
 
03:55:26.330 --> 03:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
level hearings to enable a more robust
 
03:55:29.170 --> 03:55:29.180 align:start position:0%
sharing of information a more robust
 
03:55:32.210 --> 03:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
engagement in the process so that we
 
03:55:34.070 --> 03:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to get to a due process
 
03:55:36.229 --> 03:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
hearing that the resolution can take
 
03:55:39.050 --> 03:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
place earlier this is an important bill
 
03:55:43.189 --> 03:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
for all parties involved here in my
 
03:55:45.469 --> 03:55:45.479 align:start position:0%
sense the study committee would enable
 
03:55:47.689 --> 03:55:47.699 align:start position:0%
us to do that we had a study committee
 
03:55:50.990 --> 03:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
on this uh a session ago and we
 
03:55:52.670 --> 03:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
discovered that there were many
 
03:55:55.250 --> 03:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
opportunities to try to engage in this
 
03:55:58.250 --> 03:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
but I think what we did Miss we missed
 
03:56:00.590 --> 03:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity of how do you share
 
03:56:04.010 --> 03:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
information in a more robust way at the
 
03:56:06.950 --> 03:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
earlier part of the process rather than
 
03:56:09.469 --> 03:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
having to wait to a due process part to
 
03:56:11.570 --> 03:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
get to that so I would encourage the
 
03:56:13.250 --> 03:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
committee to seriously look at this as
 
03:56:14.570 --> 03:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
03:56:17.030 --> 03:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
to really open up that process and try
 
03:56:18.410 --> 03:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
to resolve this
 
03:56:21.290 --> 03:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
problem at the earliest phases possible
 
03:56:23.929 --> 03:56:23.939 align:start position:0%
in the whole process of of considering
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
issues for Education special ed students
 
03:56:28.610 --> 03:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:56:30.950 --> 03:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
 
03:56:35.389 --> 03:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
you I wanted to point out that this uh
 
03:56:39.050 --> 03:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
previous Bill last term had been sent to
 
03:56:41.630 --> 03:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
interim study I don't know what happened
 
03:56:44.450 --> 03:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
in terms of studying but evidently there
 
03:56:46.250 --> 03:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
wasn't much studying going on except
 
03:56:48.170 --> 03:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
saying it should not come back to
 
03:56:48.180 --> 03:56:50.150 align:start position:0%
saying it should not come back to
legislation

03:56:50.150 --> 03:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:56:53.450 --> 03:56:53.460 align:start position:0%
um in terms of not many due processing
 
03:56:57.670 --> 03:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
areas they're valid reasons why and
 
03:57:01.729 --> 03:57:01.739 align:start position:0%
basically is the cost to the parents why
 
03:57:06.290 --> 03:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
America who spent 20 30 40 000 that's
 
03:57:08.750 --> 03:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
what you're testimony about to try and
 
03:57:10.849 --> 03:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
do this especially when they know that
 
03:57:13.130 --> 03:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
death is back against it
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
the school district has all the
 
03:57:18.170 --> 03:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
resources uh in terms of the many steps
 
03:57:20.450 --> 03:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
going up to the
 
03:57:20.460 --> 03:57:21.110 align:start position:0%
going up to the
um

03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:23.870 --> 03:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
new process here mediation and so forth
 
03:57:26.570 --> 03:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
again the district holds all the parts
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
they have all the student information
 
03:57:31.130 --> 03:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
they have the observations of the
 
03:57:32.990 --> 03:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
student in the classroom
 
03:57:33.000 --> 03:57:34.250 align:start position:0%
student in the classroom
but

03:57:34.250 --> 03:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:57:36.410 --> 03:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
if they're not sharing that information
 
03:57:38.330 --> 03:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
if they're not letting the parent come
 
03:57:41.510 --> 03:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
in and observe the classroom if they're
 
03:57:44.210 --> 03:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
not providing all the information to the
 
03:57:44.220 --> 03:57:45.110 align:start position:0%
not providing all the information to the
parent

03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
parent
 
03:57:47.630 --> 03:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
the deck is stacked against them we need
 
03:57:49.370 --> 03:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
to do something
 
03:57:51.889 --> 03:57:51.899 align:start position:0%
proficiency levels for children with
 
03:57:54.889 --> 03:57:54.899 align:start position:0%
disabilities in the state is in a
 
03:57:56.889 --> 03:57:56.899 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of 15
 
03:58:01.429 --> 03:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
Proficiency in math and uh English if we
 
03:58:03.650 --> 03:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
want these kids with special needs to
 
03:58:07.750 --> 03:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
become productive self-sufficient adults
 
03:58:11.450 --> 03:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
education is the way but if they do not
 
03:58:14.150 --> 03:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
get the services that they need
 
03:58:16.610 --> 03:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
they're they're not going anywhere in
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
terms of being self-sufficient
 
03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
this is a step
 
03:58:24.110 --> 03:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's a level of flame playing field and
 
03:58:27.550 --> 03:58:27.560 align:start position:0%
to give equal supporting the parents
 
03:58:30.410 --> 03:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
I'll offer back to the
 
03:58:33.290 --> 03:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
um letter we had from the lobbyist for
 
03:58:36.530 --> 03:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
the uh school special education
 
03:58:36.540 --> 03:58:38.830 align:start position:0%
the uh school special education
administrators

03:58:38.830 --> 03:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
03:58:42.170 --> 03:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
unbelievable unbelievable
 
03:58:42.180 --> 03:58:44.750 align:start position:0%
unbelievable unbelievable
um

03:58:44.750 --> 03:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:47.809 --> 03:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
increased local costs
 
03:58:49.849 --> 03:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
but what about the cost of the parents
 
03:58:52.490 --> 03:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
what about the human cost what about the
 
03:58:55.130 --> 03:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
cost for those children who are not
 
03:58:58.729 --> 03:58:58.739 align:start position:0%
getting the services and to not get a
 
03:59:02.090 --> 03:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
fair hearing and the other statement
 
03:59:07.189 --> 03:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:09.769 --> 03:59:09.779 align:start position:0%
oh yeah the school districts
 
03:59:13.189 --> 03:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
um have finite costs again what about
 
03:59:15.710 --> 03:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
the cost for the parents talk about
 
03:59:19.090 --> 03:59:19.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:22.250 --> 03:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
taxes anytime parents can't go out and
 
03:59:25.130 --> 03:59:25.140 align:start position:0%
get a second and third job all the time
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
just so they can have a due process
 
03:59:30.650 --> 03:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
hearing come on
 
03:59:33.830 --> 03:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
a quote our president come on man let's
 
03:59:36.590 --> 03:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh let's uh do something for the kids
 
03:59:38.750 --> 03:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
let's do something for the kids with
 
03:59:44.269 --> 03:59:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative uh
 
03:59:46.800 --> 03:59:49.790 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative uh
representative

03:59:49.790 --> 03:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:59:49.800 --> 03:59:52.670 align:start position:0%
representative
woodcock

03:59:52.670 --> 03:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:59:56.330 --> 03:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative lad I appreciate that uh
 
03:59:58.610 --> 03:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
to speak to both the amendment and the
 
04:00:00.410 --> 04:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
primary motion
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
um first off I I sincerely want to thank
 
04:00:05.150 --> 04:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli for bringing
 
04:00:07.490 --> 04:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
this topic forward
 
04:00:10.550 --> 04:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
um as representative Mullen indicated uh
 
04:00:13.370 --> 04:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
this is this is an easy which side of
 
04:00:15.290 --> 04:00:15.300 align:start position:0%
the coin you want to be on topic there's
 
04:00:17.990 --> 04:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
no right answer here uh representative
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
Shaw clearly indicated what the pathway
 
04:00:24.710 --> 04:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
is and the the the youngsters and the
 
04:00:27.290 --> 04:00:27.300 align:start position:0%
parents who are being neglected uh
 
04:00:29.889 --> 04:00:29.899 align:start position:0%
Barbara's comments are right on target
 
04:00:34.010 --> 04:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
it is a back loaded system when we try
 
04:00:36.290 --> 04:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
to make the clarification at the final
 
04:00:38.809 --> 04:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
meeting of due process the system should
 
04:00:41.210 --> 04:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
be your front loaded system we engage
 
04:00:42.590 --> 04:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
the youngsters and the parents the
 
04:00:45.170 --> 04:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
family much earlier from day one
 
04:00:48.769 --> 04:00:48.779 align:start position:0%
having sat through many IEPs throughout
 
04:00:51.710 --> 04:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
my career I agree the parents often come
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
out short suited and this is a great
 
04:00:54.889 --> 04:00:54.899 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take a look at that whole
 
04:00:57.769 --> 04:00:57.779 align:start position:0%
system and and pull it together
 
04:00:57.779 --> 04:00:58.729 align:start position:0%
system and and pull it together
um

04:00:58.729 --> 04:00:58.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:00.889 --> 04:01:00.899 align:start position:0%
so I think that's a key point I think
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
the this is the time to do that not wait
 
04:01:06.469 --> 04:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
till the end uh I do have to uh take
 
04:01:07.969 --> 04:01:07.979 align:start position:0%
numbers though with Summer
 
04:01:09.710 --> 04:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli's comments about
 
04:01:12.110 --> 04:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
leveling the playing field and the human
 
04:01:14.570 --> 04:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
cost and the students cost and let's do
 
04:01:17.330 --> 04:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
something that's all funding has all
 
04:01:19.550 --> 04:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
education funded we want to level the
 
04:01:21.110 --> 04:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
playing field let's improve the
 
04:01:23.389 --> 04:01:23.399 align:start position:0%
Educational Funding system for students
 
04:01:25.010 --> 04:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
and for special needs students in the
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
system let's improve the way we identify
 
04:01:29.990 --> 04:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
access and achievement that's the whole
 
04:01:31.550 --> 04:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
part of the piece you just can't extract
 
04:01:33.889 --> 04:01:33.899 align:start position:0%
one little one little digit and say well
 
04:01:35.570 --> 04:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
this is what we're going to address but
 
04:01:37.490 --> 04:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
in the bigger picture representative
 
04:01:39.349 --> 04:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
Shaw is running a Target this should be
 
04:01:41.929 --> 04:01:41.939 align:start position:0%
a study committee that is robust and I'd
 
04:01:43.969 --> 04:01:43.979 align:start position:0%
love to have representative cordelli on
 
04:01:45.590 --> 04:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
it and I'd be happy to join them I think
 
04:01:47.269 --> 04:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
this is the critical piece
 
04:01:49.790 --> 04:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
parents with students who are have
 
04:01:52.969 --> 04:01:52.979 align:start position:0%
special needs are Egypt from day one
 
04:01:55.610 --> 04:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult process from day one
 
04:01:57.710 --> 04:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
before the youngsters even get there and
 
04:01:59.450 --> 04:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
then no matter how successful they are
 
04:02:01.729 --> 04:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
which uh through the process they're
 
04:02:03.349 --> 04:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
always at a disadvantage and I agree
 
04:02:05.030 --> 04:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
with that but I think we have to look at
 
04:02:06.290 --> 04:02:06.300 align:start position:0%
the process as a bigger entities
 
04:02:08.330 --> 04:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
represent representative Ladd and start
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
at the bottom I I would I would be happy
 
04:02:11.929 --> 04:02:11.939 align:start position:0%
to work with representative Mullen and
 
04:02:14.750 --> 04:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
Cordelia on this and bring it up a
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
better picture better for parents thank
 
04:02:17.520 --> 04:02:25.790 align:start position:0%
better picture better for parents thank
you

04:02:25.790 --> 04:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:28.150 --> 04:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
um I too have been a
 
04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
teacher and a principal for the 30 years
 
04:02:33.600 --> 04:02:34.809 align:start position:0%
teacher and a principal for the 30 years
and

04:02:34.809 --> 04:02:34.819 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely I've seen so many kids
 
04:02:42.650 --> 04:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
that had have had difficulties simply
 
04:02:44.210 --> 04:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
because they're up against this
 
04:02:46.610 --> 04:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic machine
 
04:02:49.729 --> 04:02:49.739 align:start position:0%
and we just heard people say we need to
 
04:02:49.739 --> 04:02:51.290 align:start position:0%
and we just heard people say we need to
engage

04:02:51.290 --> 04:02:51.300 align:start position:0%
engage
 
04:02:54.170 --> 04:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
parents are Egypt
 
04:02:54.180 --> 04:02:54.889 align:start position:0%
parents are Egypt
um

04:02:54.889 --> 04:02:54.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
not many due process hearings have been
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
heard I wonder why
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example of a curve
 
04:03:04.250 --> 04:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
right here with one of my own kids
 
04:03:04.260 --> 04:03:06.050 align:start position:0%
right here with one of my own kids
grandkids

04:03:06.050 --> 04:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
grandkids
 
04:03:07.969 --> 04:03:07.979 align:start position:0%
and then after
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
who had to have Speech Pathology
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
and we confer in fact my my daughter one
 
04:03:17.689 --> 04:03:17.699 align:start position:0%
of my daughters is a speed pathologist
 
04:03:20.689 --> 04:03:20.699 align:start position:0%
audiologist also indicated that he
 
04:03:22.670 --> 04:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
needed some speech help so he went to
 
04:03:25.729 --> 04:03:25.739 align:start position:0%
school we've got the IEP
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
when we came in for the annual review
 
04:03:32.150 --> 04:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
there was real problems
 
04:03:34.790 --> 04:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
our grandson told us that again really
 
04:03:36.710 --> 04:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
meant was speech pathologist hardly at
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
all maybe once a month
 
04:03:41.689 --> 04:03:41.699 align:start position:0%
and of course that's not the eye Visa
 
04:03:43.969 --> 04:03:43.979 align:start position:0%
and there was a terror providing that
 
04:03:43.979 --> 04:03:46.550 align:start position:0%
and there was a terror providing that
service

04:03:46.550 --> 04:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:50.050 --> 04:03:50.060 align:start position:0%
when we went in and had that IEP meeting
 
04:03:53.450 --> 04:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
my daughter asked for her son is there
 
04:03:55.910 --> 04:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
any documentation of those IEP meetings
 
04:03:58.370 --> 04:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
which should be held she is a special ed
 
04:04:00.170 --> 04:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
teacher she knows the law
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
there was none
 
04:04:05.150 --> 04:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
no documentation of the times that the
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
service was supposed to be provided I
 
04:04:09.710 --> 04:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
even questioned whether the service was
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
being provided
 
04:04:14.570 --> 04:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
now this bill reverses the burden of
 
04:04:14.580 --> 04:04:16.269 align:start position:0%
now this bill reverses the burden of
proof

04:04:16.269 --> 04:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
proof
 
04:04:20.030 --> 04:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
persuasion and production are now on the
 
04:04:21.950 --> 04:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
part of the school district to provide
 
04:04:24.530 --> 04:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
that evidence we couldn't get the
 
04:04:26.210 --> 04:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
evidence we couldn't get the schedule
 
04:04:28.969 --> 04:04:28.979 align:start position:0%
book which showed the days of the days
 
04:04:31.309 --> 04:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
the student didn't get their help
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
and and the reason why there's so very
 
04:04:36.349 --> 04:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
few due process hearings
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
parents just don't know how to do this
 
04:04:41.090 --> 04:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
or else they haven't been explained how
 
04:04:43.429 --> 04:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
to do this or the leadership's not there
 
04:04:45.050 --> 04:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
they're certainly not accountability
 
04:04:48.469 --> 04:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
within the program I watched now I I I'm
 
04:04:51.710 --> 04:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
not saying this is not a wide basis that
 
04:04:53.929 --> 04:04:53.939 align:start position:0%
that's true every school it's not I I
 
04:04:56.389 --> 04:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
can recall many an IEP meeting where all
 
04:04:58.250 --> 04:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
that was documented the services were
 
04:05:00.290 --> 04:05:00.300 align:start position:0%
provided and there was tremendous gains
 
04:05:03.110 --> 04:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm not trying to squash this I don't
 
04:05:04.910 --> 04:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
think that's anybody here is trying to
 
04:05:06.769 --> 04:05:06.779 align:start position:0%
say and I backed up for other
 
04:05:09.229 --> 04:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
administrators principles and teachers
 
04:05:11.570 --> 04:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
saying yes we acknowledge there is an
 
04:05:11.580 --> 04:05:12.469 align:start position:0%
saying yes we acknowledge there is an
issue

04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:05:15.469 --> 04:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
but I'm at the point myself where I
 
04:05:17.809 --> 04:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
became a very frustrated grandfather and
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
in fact I frustrated father
 
04:05:23.389 --> 04:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
when my son was sent out to the hallway
 
04:05:25.130 --> 04:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
in a school
 
04:05:27.650 --> 04:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
for a half hour unsupervised because he
 
04:05:29.689 --> 04:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
was not acting appropriately in the
 
04:05:32.090 --> 04:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
classroom second grade
 
04:05:34.189 --> 04:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
and how he had a mural drawn all over
 
04:05:37.849 --> 04:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
the hallway Paul it turned out he's
 
04:05:37.859 --> 04:05:39.349 align:start position:0%
the hallway Paul it turned out he's
gifted

04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
gifted
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
but not you well over 138 well over 138
 
04:05:46.849 --> 04:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
and achievement scores and he's the one
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
growing rapes in Bulgaria or Romania
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
right now as opinion
 
04:05:53.570 --> 04:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
um he made it but we were also told by
 
04:05:55.429 --> 04:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
that principal in that school your son
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
will never graduate from high school we
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
were told that my wife left that IEP
 
04:06:02.150 --> 04:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
mean the problem
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
so there are these devastating
 
04:06:08.150 --> 04:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
experiences that and here I am an
 
04:06:10.490 --> 04:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
administrator principal teacher and gone
 
04:06:12.830 --> 04:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
through it I wonder how many others are
 
04:06:15.110 --> 04:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
doing the same so I'll get over about my
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
soapbox here but I'm really concerned
 
04:06:21.290 --> 04:06:21.300 align:start position:0%
that it's time that parents that are
 
04:06:24.889 --> 04:06:24.899 align:start position:0%
like myself who have been so differently
 
04:06:27.410 --> 04:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
There's an opportunity for them
 
04:06:30.830 --> 04:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
to try to correct the situation but most
 
04:06:33.229 --> 04:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
importantly I think that direction can't
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
be made right within the school where
 
04:06:38.510 --> 04:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
that IEP team and the instructions being
 
04:06:40.729 --> 04:06:40.739 align:start position:0%
properly supervised I don't know what
 
04:06:42.110 --> 04:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
additional money is going to be the
 
04:06:43.490 --> 04:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
answer for this thing
 
04:06:46.490 --> 04:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
so a lot close and we'll just offer some
 
04:06:47.929 --> 04:06:47.939 align:start position:0%
other folks the opportunity to speak
 
04:06:50.269 --> 04:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
here uh represent Tanner I see you have
 
04:06:51.290 --> 04:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
04:06:53.750 --> 04:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much finally my little
 
04:06:56.269 --> 04:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
paw works over there
 
04:06:59.450 --> 04:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
um I want to say that uh you know this
 
04:07:03.229 --> 04:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
this is a very tough situation and I
 
04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
thoroughly agree with with
 
04:07:07.010 --> 04:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative Shaw
 
04:07:09.290 --> 04:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
um but I also want to amplify what
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock said that
 
04:07:14.990 --> 04:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
special ed funding uh both at the
 
04:07:17.450 --> 04:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
federal level and at the state level has
 
04:07:21.290 --> 04:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
been miserably underfunded and you know
 
04:07:22.849 --> 04:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
local districts
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
um sometimes are are just sunk with with
 
04:07:29.689 --> 04:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
special ed funding that's no excuse but
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
it certainly is part of the problem
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
I think when
 
04:07:37.849 --> 04:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
when parents uh and schools get to the
 
04:07:40.250 --> 04:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
point where they enlist lawyers and
 
04:07:43.010 --> 04:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
court cases nobody wins
 
04:07:45.050 --> 04:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
certainly the student hasn't won
 
04:07:47.210 --> 04:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
anything at that point and sometimes
 
04:07:48.769 --> 04:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
suffers greatly
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
so I think that the solution is not at
 
04:07:54.889 --> 04:07:54.899 align:start position:0%
the end not not the let's flip the due
 
04:07:58.849 --> 04:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
process procedure or let's really stick
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
it to the schools
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
um because you know they're the they're
 
04:08:05.269 --> 04:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
the bad guys I think it's
 
04:08:07.729 --> 04:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
um we need to look at the look at the
 
04:08:10.490 --> 04:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
situation look at the the
 
04:08:12.410 --> 04:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
um procedures
 
04:08:14.990 --> 04:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
the oversight by the Department of
 
04:08:19.309 --> 04:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
Education and really focus in on at the
 
04:08:19.319 --> 04:08:20.469 align:start position:0%
Education and really focus in on at the
beginning

04:08:20.469 --> 04:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
04:08:24.410 --> 04:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
where where's the issue why why is there
 
04:08:27.170 --> 04:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
not more sharing of information
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
um obviously
 
04:08:28.680 --> 04:08:29.269 align:start position:0%
um obviously
um

04:08:29.269 --> 04:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd chair lad you have
 
04:08:34.130 --> 04:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
some definite ideas from from your
 
04:08:36.769 --> 04:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
experience and I'm sure Bonnie Dunham
 
04:08:40.250 --> 04:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
would have ideas and my constituents who
 
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
have talked to me have ideas and I think
 
04:08:45.410 --> 04:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
we can work together to try to come up
 
04:08:49.969 --> 04:08:49.979 align:start position:0%
with a system that helps the student and
 
04:08:52.969 --> 04:08:52.979 align:start position:0%
doesn't put such an undue burden on both
 
04:08:55.490 --> 04:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
the parents and the schools that they
 
04:08:56.750 --> 04:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
get to a
 
04:08:59.570 --> 04:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
place where lawyers are making money and
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're at a court case and and the
 
04:09:04.429 --> 04:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
student suffers so I would strongly
 
04:09:04.439 --> 04:09:05.689 align:start position:0%
student suffers so I would strongly
recommend

04:09:05.689 --> 04:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
um the study committee for this and
 
04:09:10.429 --> 04:09:10.439 align:start position:0%
really I think you can see the passion
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
you can hear the passion of the people
 
04:09:14.929 --> 04:09:14.939 align:start position:0%
on this committee both Democrat and
 
04:09:18.290 --> 04:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
Republican and I think it's time that we
 
04:09:20.210 --> 04:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
we roll our sleeves up and I think
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
things will get done
 
04:09:22.319 --> 04:09:22.969 align:start position:0%
things will get done
um

04:09:22.969 --> 04:09:22.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:25.670 --> 04:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
this time so that's why I would vote for
 
04:09:27.410 --> 04:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
a study committee thank you
 
04:09:29.050 --> 04:09:29.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:35.450 --> 04:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
um I just want to know how long are we
 
04:09:39.469 --> 04:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
going to keep studying this we studied
 
04:09:41.870 --> 04:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
this the last two years we've retained
 
04:09:43.910 --> 04:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
it we studied it we've had people come
 
04:09:47.330 --> 04:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
in we heard stories last term we heard
 
04:09:49.070 --> 04:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
stories this term
 
04:09:52.250 --> 04:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
are we going to study it more are we
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to actually put some teeth in the
 
04:09:56.990 --> 04:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
matter the thing that really struck me
 
04:09:59.929 --> 04:09:59.939 align:start position:0%
in listening to all the testimony is
 
04:10:01.790 --> 04:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
that the only person
 
04:10:04.969 --> 04:10:04.979 align:start position:0%
who spoke against this spoke against it
 
04:10:07.729 --> 04:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
because then parents would win more
 
04:10:10.130 --> 04:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
often and the schools would have to pay
 
04:10:11.929 --> 04:10:11.939 align:start position:0%
more money because they'd actually have
 
04:10:14.330 --> 04:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
to provide the services that they were
 
04:10:16.849 --> 04:10:16.859 align:start position:0%
supposed to and to me that's very
 
04:10:19.610 --> 04:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
telling and I think if the burden of
 
04:10:22.790 --> 04:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
proof was put back it was given to the
 
04:10:25.610 --> 04:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
school then they might think twice about
 
04:10:27.469 --> 04:10:27.479 align:start position:0%
the things that they were doing if they
 
04:10:29.870 --> 04:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
had to prove that they were providing
 
04:10:31.729 --> 04:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
proper support they might have kept
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
those records for for representative lab
 
04:10:37.849 --> 04:10:37.859 align:start position:0%
um you know I they're not doing what
 
04:10:39.429 --> 04:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be doing right now
 
04:10:42.889 --> 04:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
and so we studied we've talked we've
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
listened we've had parents in over and
 
04:10:47.150 --> 04:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
over and over about these issues nothing
 
04:10:50.809 --> 04:10:50.819 align:start position:0%
has changed I think it's time not study
 
04:10:53.689 --> 04:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
it to do to actually
 
04:10:55.790 --> 04:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
give the parents a little bit of power
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
yes there's a huge system that happens
 
04:11:01.309 --> 04:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
beforehand changing burden of proof does
 
04:11:03.229 --> 04:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
not change all that lead up all that
 
04:11:05.269 --> 04:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
lead up is still going to be there but
 
04:11:08.210 --> 04:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
but when it fails this gives the parents
 
04:11:10.490 --> 04:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
a chance and it might give some
 
04:11:13.250 --> 04:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
incentive to the schools to actually do
 
04:11:16.130 --> 04:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
what they are supposed to do thank you
 
04:11:18.710 --> 04:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you see we have representative
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
Anderson representative
 
04:11:24.530 --> 04:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I'm against this
 
04:11:27.650 --> 04:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
amendment because I'm also against how
 
04:11:30.590 --> 04:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
much do we study something one of my
 
04:11:32.689 --> 04:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
questions is and I don't think we're
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
going to get an answer here right now is
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
if this is such an issue why doesn't the
 
04:11:40.849 --> 04:11:40.859 align:start position:0%
Department of Education why haven't they
 
04:11:43.010 --> 04:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
stepped in and tried to straighten it
 
04:11:49.130 --> 04:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:49.140 --> 04:11:50.150 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:11:50.150 --> 04:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:11:52.010 --> 04:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
um having been a guidance counselor in a
 
04:11:53.990 --> 04:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
middle school for 36 years I've seen
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
numerous special ed cases go through and
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
I I think but if you wait until the time
 
04:12:01.849 --> 04:12:01.859 align:start position:0%
where it gets to the special ed hearing
 
04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
and having to show burden of proof years
 
04:12:06.410 --> 04:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
can have gone by
 
04:12:08.689 --> 04:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
um there are so many steps to go through
 
04:12:12.110 --> 04:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
before you get there that if the years
 
04:12:14.870 --> 04:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
go by the student loses and the parents
 
04:12:17.870 --> 04:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
lose so I think a study committee could
 
04:12:21.170 --> 04:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
look at it and make put things in place
 
04:12:24.349 --> 04:12:24.359 align:start position:0%
so that it doesn't get to that point if
 
04:12:26.809 --> 04:12:26.819 align:start position:0%
we wait that long students would come in
 
04:12:28.969 --> 04:12:28.979 align:start position:0%
in the sixth grade go through all the
 
04:12:32.150 --> 04:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
steps try this try that find through off
 
04:12:34.550 --> 04:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
to high school by the time it gets to
 
04:12:37.969 --> 04:12:37.979 align:start position:0%
that point that's too late you know when
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
it should be steps incremental right at
 
04:12:43.130 --> 04:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
the beginning something's wrong if
 
04:12:44.990 --> 04:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
they're not getting their services right
 
04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
away as they should and I think that's
 
04:12:48.889 --> 04:12:48.899 align:start position:0%
what we should be looking at and I agree
 
04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
with is representative Andrus that the
 
04:12:54.050 --> 04:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
department of Ed should be looking at
 
04:12:56.269 --> 04:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
things more closely too
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:12:58.080 --> 04:13:01.309 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

04:13:01.309 --> 04:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative Andrus your comments
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
were going to be my answer to
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
representative leckis
 
04:13:15.889 --> 04:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
um I I I we talk all the time in this
 
04:13:17.269 --> 04:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
committee about the Department of
 
04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
Education not having any teeth and by
 
04:13:23.150 --> 04:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
that we mean that they don't
 
04:13:26.210 --> 04:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
um seem to have the supervisory capacity
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to step in in a situation
 
04:13:32.210 --> 04:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
like this I think that's one of I I
 
04:13:33.889 --> 04:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
think that's a that's a critically
 
04:13:37.250 --> 04:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
important factor for us to look at in
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
this situation and any situation in
 
04:13:41.630 --> 04:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
which we've got the department of Ed
 
04:13:44.269 --> 04:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
overseeing regulatory things that go on
 
04:13:48.769 --> 04:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
in schools and uh you know I I maybe
 
04:13:50.929 --> 04:13:50.939 align:start position:0%
practice makes perfect maybe that's why
 
04:13:54.290 --> 04:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this again but
 
04:13:55.790 --> 04:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
um I feel like this has a different
 
04:13:59.330 --> 04:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
feeling to it this time and I am hoping
 
04:14:01.969 --> 04:14:01.979 align:start position:0%
against hope that we can make this into
 
04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan effort because I'll tell
 
04:14:05.570 --> 04:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
you what those kids that we're
 
04:14:07.849 --> 04:14:07.859 align:start position:0%
advocating for they don't come with a
 
04:14:10.849 --> 04:14:10.859 align:start position:0%
political party sticker on them so I am
 
04:14:14.150 --> 04:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
hoping against hope that we are able to
 
04:14:16.429 --> 04:14:16.439 align:start position:0%
seriously look at this and come up with
 
04:14:18.889 --> 04:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
a well thought out solution thank you
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:14:21.229 --> 04:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:25.210 --> 04:14:25.220 align:start position:0%
are there representative uh
 
04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
got your hand up in front of your face
 
04:14:32.830 --> 04:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
04:14:37.790 --> 04:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:14:40.309 --> 04:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if this is not one of
 
04:14:44.330 --> 04:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
those situations in which both and is a
 
04:14:46.969 --> 04:14:46.979 align:start position:0%
better answer than either or
 
04:14:50.450 --> 04:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
it seems to me having heard this in
 
04:14:52.610 --> 04:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
various ways for several years in my
 
04:14:55.790 --> 04:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
life now that this Con final
 
04:14:59.630 --> 04:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
confrontation is created of necessity by
 
04:15:01.130 --> 04:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
the legal people
 
04:15:03.349 --> 04:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
whereas the people trying to solve the
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
problem or don't have that information
 
04:15:08.750 --> 04:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
going through the process
 
04:15:11.389 --> 04:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it first be a requirement that
 
04:15:13.969 --> 04:15:13.979 align:start position:0%
or any information that's placed in a
 
04:15:16.790 --> 04:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
student's record on which any action is
 
04:15:19.370 --> 04:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
going to be taken should be provided at
 
04:15:22.189 --> 04:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
the same time to the parents
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make any sense for the
 
04:15:27.950 --> 04:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
people to hide to things or to allow
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
forces that don't want to spend money to
 
04:15:33.410 --> 04:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
use that as a way of delaying having to
 
04:15:35.210 --> 04:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
spend money
 
04:15:37.729 --> 04:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
I think in this case if you pass this
 
04:15:37.739 --> 04:15:39.530 align:start position:0%
I think in this case if you pass this
bill

04:15:39.530 --> 04:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:15:42.050 --> 04:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
and you do a study committee you'll find
 
04:15:44.210 --> 04:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
out what the effect is and then you can
 
04:15:46.370 --> 04:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
amend that and you'll have some evidence
 
04:15:49.010 --> 04:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
on which to base your decision
 
04:15:51.290 --> 04:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
if you simply say oh we've got to study
 
04:15:53.389 --> 04:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
and then wait exactly it's going to
 
04:15:55.429 --> 04:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
happen what has happened before you'll
 
04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
push it down the road
 
04:15:59.870 --> 04:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
and there will be answering the same
 
04:16:01.929 --> 04:16:01.939 align:start position:0%
questions again and again and again
 
04:16:05.389 --> 04:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
without a solution
 
04:16:08.090 --> 04:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
that's my piece I want to respond to
 
04:16:10.490 --> 04:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
that representative Ford I think he's on
 
04:16:13.849 --> 04:16:13.859 align:start position:0%
a track that that I would accept
 
04:16:13.859 --> 04:16:15.050 align:start position:0%
a track that that I would accept
that

04:16:15.050 --> 04:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
there is Need for this to be looked at
 
04:16:20.990 --> 04:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
and looked at comprehensively with the
 
04:16:23.630 --> 04:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and with
 
04:16:25.990 --> 04:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
legislative support
 
04:16:29.870 --> 04:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
committee but there's also need for the
 
04:16:33.830 --> 04:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
the legislation as described and put
 
04:16:39.530 --> 04:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
into HB 581 to also move forward
 
04:16:42.769 --> 04:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
so I I would suggest that we need to
 
04:16:44.750 --> 04:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
have both
 
04:16:44.760 --> 04:16:45.469 align:start position:0%
have both
um

04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:48.349 --> 04:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
the for example in the situations I just
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
alluded to it with my own child and my
 
04:16:50.640 --> 04:16:51.769 align:start position:0%
alluded to it with my own child and my
grandchild

04:16:51.769 --> 04:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
grandchild
 
04:16:55.729 --> 04:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
that the proof wasn't there there was
 
04:16:57.710 --> 04:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
just no documentation
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
and there's no way I could prove
 
04:16:59.880 --> 04:17:00.950 align:start position:0%
and there's no way I could prove
anything

04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:17:05.050 --> 04:17:05.060 align:start position:0%
uh unless I want to go through a whole
 
04:17:08.090 --> 04:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
hearing process attracting people and
 
04:17:10.429 --> 04:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not that type of person I don't do
 
04:17:12.110 --> 04:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
that I think many parents are the same
 
04:17:15.110 --> 04:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
so we have a system that's not working
 
04:17:17.330 --> 04:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
correctly I don't know and I also
 
04:17:19.610 --> 04:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
support what representative Mullen has
 
04:17:21.189 --> 04:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
said the fact that
 
04:17:24.290 --> 04:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
most of the staff at the Department of
 
04:17:24.300 --> 04:17:25.670 align:start position:0%
most of the staff at the Department of
Education

04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
Education
 
04:17:28.729 --> 04:17:28.739 align:start position:0%
and and R Allison whose work at the art
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
Department Bible is very knowledgeable
 
04:17:34.010 --> 04:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
this fact that approximately 75 to 80
 
04:17:36.050 --> 04:17:36.060 align:start position:0%
percent of people are coming from are
 
04:17:37.729 --> 04:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
paid by federal dollars to begin with
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
and they're just monitoring programs
 
04:17:42.650 --> 04:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
they're not actively getting out the way
 
04:17:46.969 --> 04:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
they really we hope they would and to
 
04:17:49.070 --> 04:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
really overseeing many of the
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
Departments yes some people get out
 
04:17:53.030 --> 04:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
there yes they they look but it's not
 
04:17:54.830 --> 04:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
the way there's no curriculum
 
04:17:56.510 --> 04:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
departments and I can see now that we're
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to set up now and I I concur that
 
04:18:01.929 --> 04:18:01.939 align:start position:0%
this is an area that we're really
 
04:18:06.050 --> 04:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
missing in New Hampshire so
 
04:18:08.630 --> 04:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
um I like the Cs move both directions if
 
04:18:08.640 --> 04:18:17.450 align:start position:0%
um I like the Cs move both directions if
possible

04:18:17.450 --> 04:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:19.490 --> 04:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
I think I think I've already said my
 
04:18:22.429 --> 04:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
piece I I this is just such a such an
 
04:18:23.870 --> 04:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
important issue
 
04:18:26.510 --> 04:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
that I just I just think that that we
 
04:18:28.130 --> 04:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
get one more shot
 
04:18:30.110 --> 04:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
at this study because one of the things
 
04:18:32.030 --> 04:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
I think that resume Mullins were talking
 
04:18:35.269 --> 04:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
about is how do we how do we engage the
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
parents as part of the study
 
04:18:42.050 --> 04:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
in a way so that that we can hear their
 
04:18:45.050 --> 04:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
voice is loud and clear along with the
 
04:18:47.389 --> 04:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
school folks so that we can get some
 
04:18:49.130 --> 04:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
kind of a match here
 
04:18:51.170 --> 04:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
and then come out with a recommendation
 
04:18:54.290 --> 04:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
that's going to have substance to it in
 
04:18:57.769 --> 04:18:57.779 align:start position:0%
a way that's not pro School Pro parents
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
but it's Pro kids
 
04:19:01.910 --> 04:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the concern that I
 
04:19:04.010 --> 04:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
have right now is that if we go forward
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
with the go as it's proposed right now
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
we miss that opportunity of engaging the
 
04:19:12.229 --> 04:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
cheap principles that have to deal with
 
04:19:14.510 --> 04:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
this issue and determining what kind of
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
an educational opportunity uh special
 
04:19:18.889 --> 04:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
needs kids are going to have that's why
 
04:19:22.130 --> 04:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
I really encourage the study thing so
 
04:19:23.809 --> 04:19:23.819 align:start position:0%
that we can really look at this in a way
 
04:19:25.309 --> 04:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
and come out with a recommendation
 
04:19:28.490 --> 04:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's going to be positive and move us
 
04:19:30.769 --> 04:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
forward rather than in a confrontational
 
04:19:33.950 --> 04:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
mode that's my fear thank you thank you
 
04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative so representative and I
 
04:19:38.090 --> 04:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
have a question for you when you were
 
04:19:40.450 --> 04:19:40.460 align:start position:0%
developing your Amendment language here
 
04:19:43.070 --> 04:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
that they'll replace the your Amendment
 
04:19:46.370 --> 04:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
replaces all after the enacting clause
 
04:19:49.790 --> 04:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
so it basically replaces the entire Bill
 
04:19:52.130 --> 04:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
and replaces it with what you have in
 
04:19:55.309 --> 04:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment it does if you give any
 
04:19:58.790 --> 04:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
consideration to trying to uh
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
incorporate both of these things that
 
04:20:04.250 --> 04:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
what their men has and uh the other
 
04:20:07.250 --> 04:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
which deals with the burden of proof
 
04:20:10.130 --> 04:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
you know I did I I thought a lot about
 
04:20:10.140 --> 04:20:11.030 align:start position:0%
you know I did I I thought a lot about
it

04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:20:14.030 --> 04:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
um the reason that I went with the study
 
04:20:16.610 --> 04:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
committee separate from anything to do
 
04:20:20.809 --> 04:20:20.819 align:start position:0%
with the original bill is uh germane to
 
04:20:23.809 --> 04:20:23.819 align:start position:0%
what representative Miler just said I
 
04:20:26.809 --> 04:20:26.819 align:start position:0%
think that if we set up the adversarial
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
relationship between the school and the
 
04:20:33.889 --> 04:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
parent prior to being able to figure out
 
04:20:36.889 --> 04:20:36.899 align:start position:0%
how to work together and to give
 
04:20:39.170 --> 04:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
everybody a voice and a stake in the
 
04:20:41.870 --> 04:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
equation then I think we're gonna I I
 
04:20:43.849 --> 04:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
think we're gonna set it up so that
 
04:20:45.950 --> 04:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
people are
 
04:20:48.050 --> 04:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
argumentative with each other when we
 
04:20:49.729 --> 04:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
really want is for them to be
 
04:20:51.530 --> 04:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
collaborative with each other
 
04:20:54.290 --> 04:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
so I think that you know I I think that
 
04:20:58.370 --> 04:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
I recognize the fact that this is a half
 
04:21:01.370 --> 04:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
step that people who have been parent
 
04:21:04.010 --> 04:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
advocates for a long time are frustrated
 
04:21:06.729 --> 04:21:06.739 align:start position:0%
with I I get that
 
04:21:10.610 --> 04:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
uh however I think that you know if
 
04:21:12.889 --> 04:21:12.899 align:start position:0%
people can live with the half step and
 
04:21:16.070 --> 04:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
we can craft a solution that does not
 
04:21:19.130 --> 04:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
involve parties antagonizing each other
 
04:21:22.490 --> 04:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
I think it's a win-win otherwise
 
04:21:24.110 --> 04:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
I think we're right back to where we
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
were and that is that we end up with a
 
04:21:25.920 --> 04:21:27.950 align:start position:0%
were and that is that we end up with a
loser

04:21:27.950 --> 04:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
loser
 
04:21:34.010 --> 04:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:35.689 --> 04:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
turn my
 
04:21:35.699 --> 04:21:36.830 align:start position:0%
turn my
um

04:21:36.830 --> 04:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:41.630 --> 04:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh in line with um this amendment uh I'd
 
04:21:44.110 --> 04:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
already talked to some of the parents
 
04:21:49.010 --> 04:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
who testified on the 581 about uh can
 
04:21:50.450 --> 04:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
you get her this summer we're talking
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
about uh things that could be done
 
04:21:56.750 --> 04:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
um with the entire process and where the
 
04:21:58.849 --> 04:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
problems were
 
04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:22:04.490 --> 04:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
um if the committee is willing I would
 
04:22:08.990 --> 04:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
be going to have an amendment drafted to
 
04:22:13.729 --> 04:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
add the study committee on qhb 581 as a
 
04:22:16.189 --> 04:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
separate section of the bill
 
04:22:20.809 --> 04:22:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:20.819 --> 04:22:25.309 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:22:25.309 --> 04:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:27.469 --> 04:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
04:22:27.479 --> 04:22:28.610 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
um

04:22:28.610 --> 04:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:31.849 --> 04:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
you keep talking about adversarial and
 
04:22:33.769 --> 04:22:33.779 align:start position:0%
it seems to me from all the parents that
 
04:22:36.290 --> 04:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
we listen to there's already if you're
 
04:22:38.570 --> 04:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
going to consider adversarial
 
04:22:40.849 --> 04:22:40.859 align:start position:0%
sort of this
 
04:22:40.859 --> 04:22:42.170 align:start position:0%
sort of this
um

04:22:42.170 --> 04:22:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:42.180 --> 04:22:43.490 align:start position:0%
um
almost

04:22:43.490 --> 04:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
almost
 
04:22:45.229 --> 04:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
like they're feeling that it's
 
04:22:49.550 --> 04:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
adversarial in that uh they're being
 
04:22:51.889 --> 04:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
required to do all of this stuff that
 
04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
they have no ability to do and
 
04:22:55.439 --> 04:22:57.769 align:start position:0%
they have no ability to do and
um

04:22:57.769 --> 04:22:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
and so whether it's the burden of proof
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
on the school or burden of the proof on
 
04:23:04.070 --> 04:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
the parents either way it's the burden
 
04:23:06.889 --> 04:23:06.899 align:start position:0%
of proof on one of them and so if just
 
04:23:08.809 --> 04:23:08.819 align:start position:0%
by having the burden of proof on one or
 
04:23:10.550 --> 04:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
the other makes it adversarial it's
 
04:23:11.929 --> 04:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:23:14.150 --> 04:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
I don't want it to be adversarial nobody
 
04:23:16.550 --> 04:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
should ever get to that point which is
 
04:23:18.650 --> 04:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
the point of the study committee is to
 
04:23:20.330 --> 04:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
try to see what's going on why we don't
 
04:23:22.370 --> 04:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
get to that point but when we get to
 
04:23:25.010 --> 04:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
that point which we urge parents who had
 
04:23:29.570 --> 04:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
had all kinds of meetings and and things
 
04:23:31.490 --> 04:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
that went on before they ever went to
 
04:23:33.290 --> 04:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
that point
 
04:23:36.110 --> 04:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
um and as I believe it was
 
04:23:36.120 --> 04:23:37.750 align:start position:0%
um and as I believe it was
representative

04:23:37.750 --> 04:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:23:39.650 --> 04:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
Miler said
 
04:23:41.210 --> 04:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
um that there's this whole process
 
04:23:44.570 --> 04:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
there's this whole process and so this
 
04:23:47.090 --> 04:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
all we're talking about with this is the
 
04:23:50.030 --> 04:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
end result the time when all that
 
04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
process fails and at that point it
 
04:23:55.490 --> 04:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
should not be the parents burden it
 
04:23:57.710 --> 04:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
should be the school's birth
 
04:23:57.720 --> 04:23:58.969 align:start position:0%
should be the school's birth
um

04:23:58.969 --> 04:23:58.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:01.790 --> 04:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
but I love the idea of the study
 
04:24:03.170 --> 04:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
committee because clearly we've got to
 
04:24:05.929 --> 04:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
find out why that process is failing and
 
04:24:08.330 --> 04:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
try to stop it so I like the idea of
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
doing both give the parents something
 
04:24:13.849 --> 04:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
give the parents
 
04:24:18.170 --> 04:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
um an opportunity to actually
 
04:24:21.050 --> 04:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
get things done when the process has
 
04:24:23.929 --> 04:24:23.939 align:start position:0%
failed and try to make sure the process
 
04:24:27.110 --> 04:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:27.120 --> 04:24:32.510 align:start position:0%
 
Ure

04:24:32.510 --> 04:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:35.510 --> 04:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
if I got it yep thank you as I said
 
04:24:38.809 --> 04:24:38.819 align:start position:0%
before you know when it gets to the to
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
the end of the line when it gets to
 
04:24:44.150 --> 04:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
where this new process actually takes
 
04:24:48.050 --> 04:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
place nobody's going to win uh and
 
04:24:50.750 --> 04:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
nobody nobody wins and particularly the
 
04:24:52.670 --> 04:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
children don't win and and the
 
04:24:55.729 --> 04:24:55.739 align:start position:0%
frustration and the animosity that
 
04:24:58.189 --> 04:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
exists at that point
 
04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
um just isn't and frustration isn't
 
04:25:02.330 --> 04:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
going to go away I mean representative
 
04:25:05.330 --> 04:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
Ladd still has it from way way way back
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
so it's obviously a bad situation
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
04:25:11.279 --> 04:25:11.990 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
um

04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:15.170 --> 04:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
penalize well the flipping I I guess my
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
one of my problems is flipping due
 
04:25:18.479 --> 04:25:20.090 align:start position:0%
one of my problems is flipping due
process

04:25:20.090 --> 04:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:25:20.100 --> 04:25:20.870 align:start position:0%
process
um

04:25:20.870 --> 04:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:24.590 --> 04:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's a an issue that I think is
 
04:25:29.330 --> 04:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
going to bring more lawyers into this
 
04:25:31.010 --> 04:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
whole bill
 
04:25:34.250 --> 04:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
um and and I think you know Discovery is
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
what we're really asking for is is is a
 
04:25:40.130 --> 04:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
type of Discovery at an early stage in
 
04:25:41.450 --> 04:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
the game
 
04:25:44.330 --> 04:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
um and as representative Mullen said
 
04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
collaboration rather than
 
04:25:50.570 --> 04:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
aggravation animosity and having two
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
separate agencies or two separate groups
 
04:25:57.649 --> 04:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
uh dig their heels in at a court case so
 
04:26:00.590 --> 04:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't I I see
 
04:26:03.290 --> 04:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
passing this bill as it is right now
 
04:26:06.349 --> 04:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
is is going to set up more of an issue
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
that will be harder to resolve the
 
04:26:09.000 --> 04:26:10.689 align:start position:0%
that will be harder to resolve the
collaboration

04:26:10.689 --> 04:26:10.699 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
04:26:13.250 --> 04:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
and front loading
 
04:26:16.490 --> 04:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
um work of Discovery or of sharing
 
04:26:20.809 --> 04:26:20.819 align:start position:0%
documents or however we have it and so I
 
04:26:22.969 --> 04:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
I don't think you need to have
 
04:26:26.450 --> 04:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
you know the big Club out there
 
04:26:28.729 --> 04:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
um I think what we need to do is work on
 
04:26:30.769 --> 04:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
the issue and work on it in the
 
04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:47.210 --> 04:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
not seeing any uh further discussion
 
04:26:47.220 --> 04:26:48.769 align:start position:0%
not seeing any uh further discussion
then

04:26:48.769 --> 04:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:26:51.590 --> 04:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
we'll go ahead and call
 
04:26:51.600 --> 04:26:53.689 align:start position:0%
we'll go ahead and call
them

04:26:53.689 --> 04:26:53.699 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:26:53.699 --> 04:26:58.849 align:start position:0%
them
amendments

04:26:58.849 --> 04:26:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:02.830 --> 04:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:02.840 --> 04:27:04.670 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:27:04.670 --> 04:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:27:09.290 --> 04:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:09.300 --> 04:27:12.429 align:start position:0%

for the hot fast production option
 
04:29:02.760 --> 04:29:04.729 align:start position:0%
for the hot fast production option
yeah

04:29:04.729 --> 04:29:04.739 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:29:07.130 --> 04:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
so we now have the the bill itself
 
04:29:09.530 --> 04:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
that's on the floor right now 581 Market
 
04:29:12.769 --> 04:29:12.779 align:start position:0%
pass uh made by representative and
 
04:29:15.170 --> 04:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
second by representative Hopson
 
04:29:15.180 --> 04:29:24.290 align:start position:0%
second by representative Hopson
um

04:29:24.290 --> 04:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.070 --> 04:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:38.510 --> 04:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
to special ed funding is a problem
 
04:29:41.630 --> 04:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
um I would hate to think that districts
 
04:29:44.269 --> 04:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
are withholding Services because of
 
04:29:47.809 --> 04:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
funding issues for these children
 
04:29:51.290 --> 04:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
I think that if districts know that they
 
04:29:53.210 --> 04:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
will have the burden of proven to due
 
04:29:56.830 --> 04:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
process hearing maybe uh there will be
 
04:30:00.530 --> 04:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
improvements uh in the process below
 
04:30:04.849 --> 04:30:04.859 align:start position:0%
that in mediation Etc because the
 
04:30:04.859 --> 04:30:05.630 align:start position:0%
that in mediation Etc because the
um

04:30:05.630 --> 04:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:09.170 --> 04:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
districts will know that the parents
 
04:30:11.330 --> 04:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
will have an important Level Playing
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
Field in the end and that they won't
 
04:30:16.490 --> 04:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the upper hand and be
 
04:30:19.570 --> 04:30:19.580 align:start position:0%
more willing to have a
 
04:30:22.929 --> 04:30:22.939 align:start position:0%
Cooperative process all the way through
 
04:30:25.309 --> 04:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
so I think that this
 
04:30:29.570 --> 04:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
step in 581 in terms of burden of proof
 
04:30:35.149 --> 04:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
will take a step for the parents but
 
04:30:36.649 --> 04:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
also hopefully
 
04:30:40.010 --> 04:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
a measure of improvement to the entire
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
process and I certainly want to look at
 
04:30:47.710 --> 04:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
the rest of the process in the future
 
04:30:50.050 --> 04:30:50.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
open for further discussion
 
04:30:54.479 --> 04:30:56.050 align:start position:0%
open for further discussion
representative

04:30:56.050 --> 04:30:56.060 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:30:59.689 --> 04:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman I just I would
 
04:31:01.490 --> 04:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
just like to reiterate in a more concise
 
04:31:04.490 --> 04:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
frame it's disappointing when we're
 
04:31:07.490 --> 04:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
talking it turns about upper hands and
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
when intuitive actions when we took no
 
04:31:13.250 --> 04:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
consideration uh looking for Solutions
 
04:31:16.189 --> 04:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
we had an opportunity for Solutions this
 
04:31:19.189 --> 04:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
is just who could who can win the prize
 
04:31:22.189 --> 04:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
shame it's a shame that this type of
 
04:31:29.090 --> 04:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:29.100 --> 04:31:31.250 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:31:31.250 --> 04:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:31:34.729 --> 04:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
yes I guess I I would voice uh
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
the same as representative Woodcock I
 
04:31:39.910 --> 04:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
find it's a sad day when it seemed like
 
04:31:43.670 --> 04:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh people were realizing and and trying
 
04:31:45.490 --> 04:31:45.500 align:start position:0%
to work together in a
 
04:31:48.110 --> 04:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
bipartisan manner to approach the
 
04:31:49.969 --> 04:31:49.979 align:start position:0%
problem and
 
04:31:54.830 --> 04:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
um it just it's gone to um punitive
 
04:31:56.929 --> 04:31:56.939 align:start position:0%
action instead so
 
04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:08.399 --> 04:32:11.630 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:32:11.630 --> 04:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:14.090 --> 04:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
and there was no prize
 
04:32:16.130 --> 04:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
and there's no prize for the child no
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
price for my life no price for myself no
 
04:32:21.229 --> 04:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
price for the school because the school
 
04:32:22.910 --> 04:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
didn't achieve what they said they were
 
04:32:24.830 --> 04:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
going to achieve
 
04:32:29.870 --> 04:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
so I I I'm sad that we were unable to
 
04:32:32.030 --> 04:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
mail these bills together because I
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
think there is reason for it as the idea
 
04:32:38.269 --> 04:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
was brought forth by uh representative
 
04:32:40.610 --> 04:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
Ford and I think that's a good proposal
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
that we needed to have both going on
 
04:32:45.050 --> 04:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
here but we can't afford to lose kids
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
for another year while we talk about
 
04:32:48.170 --> 04:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
this thing
 
04:32:50.929 --> 04:32:50.939 align:start position:0%
and this stuff's happening and it's
 
04:32:53.210 --> 04:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
impossible for the parents to oftentimes
 
04:32:55.550 --> 04:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
to get a hold of the facts
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
the evidence which is necessary for them
 
04:33:01.010 --> 04:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
to go forward for the hearing and so
 
04:33:02.210 --> 04:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
it's a death it's not stacked on behalf
 
04:33:07.789 --> 04:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
of the parent that it saddens me that
 
04:33:10.010 --> 04:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
that's the way it is and if this is the
 
04:33:13.150 --> 04:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
way it occurs and has to happen
 
04:33:17.769 --> 04:33:17.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:21.709 --> 04:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and in my years as a
 
04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
teacher and and listening to the phone
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
calls and reading the emails that I
 
04:33:31.310 --> 04:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
received from constituents who have had
 
04:33:35.650 --> 04:33:35.660 align:start position:0%
experience with uh special needs uh IEPs
 
04:33:39.051 --> 04:33:39.061 align:start position:0%
with the school districts
 
04:33:43.010 --> 04:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
I I feel strongly that the burden of
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
group should lie on the schools and and
 
04:33:49.070 --> 04:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
should have been done
 
04:33:52.131 --> 04:33:52.141 align:start position:0%
years ago it shouldn't be to parents
 
04:33:55.310 --> 04:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
that have to get a lawyer to defend for
 
04:33:56.510 --> 04:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
their child
 
04:33:58.609 --> 04:33:58.619 align:start position:0%
it should be the school district to have
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
to present the proof
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
and I think that there is like I said
 
04:34:07.369 --> 04:34:07.379 align:start position:0%
before there is a strong breakdown and I
 
04:34:10.189 --> 04:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
think that it's important that we study
 
04:34:10.199 --> 04:34:11.150 align:start position:0%
think that it's important that we study
it

04:34:11.150 --> 04:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:34:14.750 --> 04:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping that if this passes out
 
04:34:17.209 --> 04:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
of committee that a poor Amendment will
 
04:34:20.631 --> 04:34:20.641 align:start position:0%
come forward on the house floor that
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
will combine these two
 
04:34:27.849 --> 04:34:27.859 align:start position:0%
and or that will add to HB 581 so that
 
04:34:33.230 --> 04:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh study committee can be
 
04:34:36.529 --> 04:34:36.539 align:start position:0%
incorporated into this because
 
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a study of the process
 
04:34:44.090 --> 04:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
and if this passes it'll be more even
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
more of an incentive for a study
 
04:34:50.449 --> 04:34:50.459 align:start position:0%
committee to get on the ball and come up
 
04:34:53.390 --> 04:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
with some concrete answers and some
 
04:34:56.269 --> 04:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
things that can help parents in this
 
04:34:58.369 --> 04:34:58.379 align:start position:0%
frustrating process
 
04:35:01.551 --> 04:35:01.561 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
04:35:07.849 --> 04:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:10.131 --> 04:35:10.141 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:35:13.131 --> 04:35:13.141 align:start position:0%
it seems like there seems it appears
 
04:35:15.949 --> 04:35:15.959 align:start position:0%
their support for this idea
 
04:35:19.029 --> 04:35:19.039 align:start position:0%
put forward by representative Ford
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
of both the bill and a study
 
04:35:24.590 --> 04:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering I mean we're going to
 
04:35:27.890 --> 04:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
continue with the exec session next week
 
04:35:29.810 --> 04:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
we've already received notice of it
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that requires us to
 
04:35:34.970 --> 04:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
finalize our action on 581 at this
 
04:35:34.980 --> 04:35:36.051 align:start position:0%
finalize our action on 581 at this
moment

04:35:36.051 --> 04:35:36.061 align:start position:0%
moment
 
04:35:38.449 --> 04:35:38.459 align:start position:0%
we could easily draw up
 
04:35:40.789 --> 04:35:40.799 align:start position:0%
the requisite Amendment as suggested by
 
04:35:43.490 --> 04:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
04:35:46.429 --> 04:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
um and amend the amend 581 next week and
 
04:35:48.949 --> 04:35:48.959 align:start position:0%
then act upon it on Tuesday because the
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
notice is already gone out I I noticed
 
04:35:53.330 --> 04:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
it in my email of continued executive
 
04:35:53.340 --> 04:35:55.010 align:start position:0%
it in my email of continued executive
session

04:35:55.010 --> 04:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
the Bill's posted today but that does
 
04:35:58.970 --> 04:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
not require that we complete action on
 
04:36:01.609 --> 04:36:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:03.609 --> 04:36:03.619 align:start position:0%
it's just a suggestion
 
04:36:06.470 --> 04:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's what I was alluding to when I
 
04:36:08.570 --> 04:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
spoke earlier not the last time but
 
04:36:12.730 --> 04:36:12.740 align:start position:0%
prior to that that I see potential for
 
04:36:16.189 --> 04:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
working towards getting inclusion of
 
04:36:19.010 --> 04:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
both of these principles into some kind
 
04:36:21.289 --> 04:36:21.299 align:start position:0%
of legislation and
 
04:36:25.029 --> 04:36:25.039 align:start position:0%
I think this is too big an issue to
 
04:36:27.310 --> 04:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
not really
 
04:36:30.529 --> 04:36:30.539 align:start position:0%
try to achieve what we all recognize
 
04:36:32.269 --> 04:36:32.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be done
 
04:36:35.769 --> 04:36:35.779 align:start position:0%
so I'm open to
 
04:36:39.109 --> 04:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
recessing this for about a week until
 
04:36:41.510 --> 04:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
weekend you know maybe come up with some
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
amending language we may be able to we
 
04:36:45.890 --> 04:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
may not but at least we've given it that
 
04:36:45.900 --> 04:36:48.109 align:start position:0%
may not but at least we've given it that
shot

04:36:48.109 --> 04:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
shot
 
04:36:50.949 --> 04:36:50.959 align:start position:0%
I would support that
 
04:36:53.090 --> 04:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
Senate uh
 
04:36:55.670 --> 04:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative yeah thank you
 
04:36:58.849 --> 04:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
uh earlier I had said I would be wanting
 
04:37:00.970 --> 04:37:00.980 align:start position:0%
to uh bring forward a minute but
 
04:37:03.100 --> 04:37:03.110 align:start position:0%
combining us
 
04:37:03.110 --> 04:37:05.510 align:start position:0%
combining us
[Music]

04:37:05.510 --> 04:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:37:09.429 --> 04:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
if there is support on the committee for
 
04:37:14.929 --> 04:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
uh 581 bus schedule committing uh then I
 
04:37:17.869 --> 04:37:17.879 align:start position:0%
would be willing to withdraw my motion
 
04:37:20.810 --> 04:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
uh for today and we can continue it uh
 
04:37:23.209 --> 04:37:23.219 align:start position:0%
next week with an amendment we just have
 
04:37:24.890 --> 04:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
to recessive
 
04:37:27.289 --> 04:37:27.299 align:start position:0%
that you don't have to do that we just
 
04:37:30.529 --> 04:37:30.539 align:start position:0%
can recess if we can come back okay
 
04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:32.879 align:start position:0%
if I'd like to see if that's a general
 
04:37:35.631 --> 04:37:35.641 align:start position:0%
feeling of the book here that would like
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
to work you know maybe you would
 
04:37:39.289 --> 04:37:39.299 align:start position:0%
represent for daily or representative
 
04:37:40.730 --> 04:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
cordelli working with a group by
 
04:37:42.529 --> 04:37:42.539 align:start position:0%
Healthcare which way to go so I just
 
04:37:46.570 --> 04:37:46.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
but uh could I could I suggest uh Mr
 
04:37:53.209 --> 04:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
chair that perhaps uh representative
 
04:37:55.449 --> 04:37:55.459 align:start position:0%
cordelli and representing Mullen
 
04:37:59.510 --> 04:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh get together and representative Ford
 
04:38:02.029 --> 04:38:02.039 align:start position:0%
to try to craft something that can
 
04:38:05.209 --> 04:38:05.219 align:start position:0%
combine the respective issues that have
 
04:38:07.010 --> 04:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
been presented in this particular
 
04:38:09.529 --> 04:38:09.539 align:start position:0%
hearing could that be done that can be
 
04:38:09.539 --> 04:38:24.970 align:start position:0%
hearing could that be done that can be
done

04:38:24.970 --> 04:38:24.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:29.990 --> 04:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
who would do it so yeah uh I think that
 
04:38:32.209 --> 04:38:32.219 align:start position:0%
can happen and everybody's okay with
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
that if I don't hear anybody saying
 
04:38:36.590 --> 04:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
anything contrary then we'll recess this
 
04:38:39.369 --> 04:38:39.379 align:start position:0%
until a time next week
 
04:38:41.631 --> 04:38:41.641 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:38:57.650 --> 04:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:57.660 --> 04:39:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:00.480 --> 04:39:07.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:39:07.070 --> 04:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:09.170 --> 04:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
quick weekend here keep marching down

04:39:14.631 --> 04:39:14.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:17.330 --> 04:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
or we can jump over that and take that
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
on the following week and jump to let's
 
04:39:23.869 --> 04:39:23.879 align:start position:0%
say 455. what's the weather today
 
04:39:23.879 --> 04:39:30.109 align:start position:0%
say 455. what's the weather today
455

04:39:30.109 --> 04:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:32.209 --> 04:39:32.219 align:start position:0%
relative to the ability of a parent to
 
04:39:34.609 --> 04:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
enroll a child in a public school of
 
04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like to represent recognize
 
04:39:56.810 --> 04:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
representative for a motion
 
04:40:02.448 --> 04:40:02.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:06.830 --> 04:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
all right this uh the hearing on 1845 at
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh quite a bit of uh discussion
 
04:40:15.350 --> 04:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
um and uh I think that there are uh
 
04:40:16.730 --> 04:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
things that
 
04:40:16.740 --> 04:40:20.510 align:start position:0%
things that
um

04:40:20.510 --> 04:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
motion first I guess right yes I'm
 
04:40:28.368 --> 04:40:28.378 align:start position:0%
willing to retain 1845 right the 455.
 
04:40:30.770 --> 04:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
representative Andrews do you have a
 
04:40:33.948 --> 04:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
second I second the motion thank you
 
04:40:34.420 --> 04:40:34.430 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:40:34.430 --> 04:40:41.230 align:start position:0%
very much
[Music]

04:40:41.230 --> 04:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:43.788 --> 04:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion and I
 
04:40:45.890 --> 04:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
think there were some points raised and
 
04:40:48.110 --> 04:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
I know that there were already things
 
04:40:50.570 --> 04:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
that I would like to look at
 
04:40:53.150 --> 04:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
um in terms of this legislation in
 
04:40:56.630 --> 04:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
relation to what other states have done
 
04:40:59.990 --> 04:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
um that have open enrollment policies
 
04:41:03.410 --> 04:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
and legislation on the books
 
04:41:07.010 --> 04:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
um so that is why I would like to uh
 
04:41:11.330 --> 04:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:17.230 --> 04:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
I concur with uh
 
04:41:23.330 --> 04:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
by Shaman codelli and because I think
 
04:41:24.948 --> 04:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work we could do on
 
04:41:27.050 --> 04:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
this bill and improve it and bring it
 
04:41:27.060 --> 04:41:27.850 align:start position:0%
this bill and improve it and bring it
back

04:41:27.850 --> 04:41:27.860 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you the bill is now before
 
04:41:32.628 --> 04:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:41:35.150 --> 04:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and I want to I
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
want to thank the sponsor of the bill
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli for retaining
 
04:41:39.590 --> 04:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:41:43.490 --> 04:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
this is this proposal is a major change
 
04:41:43.500 --> 04:41:45.288 align:start position:0%
this is this proposal is a major change
in

04:41:45.288 --> 04:41:45.298 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:41:49.490 --> 04:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
um how in a school choice option here
 
04:41:51.170 --> 04:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
and it it
 
04:41:54.650 --> 04:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have a bill like this
 
04:41:58.250 --> 04:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that it represents
 
04:41:59.810 --> 04:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
the experience
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
of other states that have similar bills
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
I've studied the bill in in
 
04:42:05.760 --> 04:42:08.030 align:start position:0%
I've studied the bill in in
Massachusetts

04:42:08.030 --> 04:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
04:42:11.150 --> 04:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
and the current bill before us is sorely
 
04:42:11.160 --> 04:42:12.590 align:start position:0%
and the current bill before us is sorely
lacking

04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
lacking
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
any of the experience that they've had
 
04:42:16.930 --> 04:42:16.940 align:start position:0%
in the past 25 years in Massachusetts
 
04:42:19.128 --> 04:42:19.138 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill and I know there are
 
04:42:21.350 --> 04:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
other states that have done similar too
 
04:42:23.868 --> 04:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
so I think my point being is that if
 
04:42:25.250 --> 04:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a school choice
 
04:42:25.260 --> 04:42:26.150 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a school choice
bill

04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:42:29.208 --> 04:42:29.218 align:start position:0%
it needs to be representative of those
 
04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
that have gone through the tong Wars of
 
04:42:35.810 --> 04:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
uh implementing such a such a change in
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
in a school choice option that I think
 
04:42:41.448 --> 04:42:41.458 align:start position:0%
will give us an opportunity to look at
 
04:42:43.970 --> 04:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
those sense of experiences and at least
 
04:42:46.070 --> 04:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
come forward with a bill that is
 
04:42:49.310 --> 04:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
complete and can represent that sense of
 
04:42:51.948 --> 04:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
experience I may not support the bill
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
but I want to make sure that the bill at
 
04:42:55.970 --> 04:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
least is going to be
 
04:43:01.010 --> 04:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
solid in experience from other states
 
04:43:03.170 --> 04:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
so I thank representative cordelli for
 
04:43:05.390 --> 04:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
putting this uh retention Bill forward
 
04:43:07.490 --> 04:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
because I think it's needed and I
 
04:43:09.890 --> 04:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
frankly look forward to looking to
 
04:43:12.770 --> 04:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
working on this Bill thank you thank you
 
04:43:14.868 --> 04:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
very much representative representative
 
04:43:14.878 --> 04:43:15.788 align:start position:0%
very much representative representative

04:43:15.788 --> 04:43:15.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:20.270 --> 04:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I um was fortunate enough
 
04:43:22.970 --> 04:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
to end up sitting next to a lady from
 
04:43:26.330 --> 04:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
Michigan on an airplane and we had a
 
04:43:29.570 --> 04:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
long conversation the whole way out
 
04:43:33.410 --> 04:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
um about what Michigan has passed this
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
years ago and what the effects on their
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
school were and everything and so I
 
04:43:39.050 --> 04:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
think this is a great
 
04:43:41.390 --> 04:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
um idea to retain this and look at it
 
04:43:43.850 --> 04:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
and talk to other states who've been
 
04:43:46.250 --> 04:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
through this who know what are what were
 
04:43:48.170 --> 04:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
the immediate consequences what are the
 
04:43:50.330 --> 04:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
long-term consequences and I think it's
 
04:43:54.230 --> 04:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:56.330 --> 04:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:43:58.310 --> 04:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
um this comment is actually for
 
04:44:01.250 --> 04:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh
 
04:44:02.510 --> 04:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you remember
 
04:44:04.730 --> 04:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli but the last
 
04:44:06.170 --> 04:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
time we talked about this during the
 
04:44:08.270 --> 04:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
hearing I mentioned the fact that we
 
04:44:12.170 --> 04:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
have a tuition program in Bedford uh I
 
04:44:15.288 --> 04:44:15.298 align:start position:0%
went a little a little deeper to see
 
04:44:17.628 --> 04:44:17.638 align:start position:0%
what kind of status were at at this
 
04:44:21.170 --> 04:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
point and according to the district uh
 
04:44:23.570 --> 04:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
information we currently don't have
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
available seats in the middle school or
 
04:44:29.628 --> 04:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
the high school uh but there's an
 
04:44:31.490 --> 04:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
application process for the elementary
 
04:44:35.690 --> 04:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
school and the tuition is 14 200 per
 
04:44:35.700 --> 04:44:36.650 align:start position:0%
school and the tuition is 14 200 per
student

04:44:36.650 --> 04:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:44:38.810 --> 04:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to bring that to your
 
04:44:40.550 --> 04:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
attention because we were talking about
 
04:44:43.670 --> 04:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
that tuition aspect and the fact that a
 
04:44:45.948 --> 04:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
community like Bedford that already has
 
04:44:49.550 --> 04:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
a tuition program would lose fourteen
 
04:44:51.670 --> 04:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
thousand two hundred dollars per student
 
04:44:55.010 --> 04:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh if in fact this bill were to go
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
forward without uh any kind of awareness
 
04:44:59.930 --> 04:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
of that
 
04:45:03.650 --> 04:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:07.970 --> 04:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:11.030 --> 04:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
I don't see any further comments here
 
04:45:11.040 --> 04:45:15.350 align:start position:0%
I don't see any further comments here
um

04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.590 --> 04:45:18.600 align:start position:0%

um

04:47:42.970 --> 04:47:42.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:45.890 --> 04:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:47:48.170 --> 04:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman would like to speak to your
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
emotions yeah it's just so everybody can
 
04:47:50.280 --> 04:47:51.610 align:start position:0%
emotions yeah it's just so everybody can
recall

04:47:51.610 --> 04:47:51.620 align:start position:0%
recall
 
04:47:54.650 --> 04:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
what this bill was about is to remember
 
04:47:57.410 --> 04:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
that it was when the student assessment
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
the results from the Statewide
 
04:48:01.730 --> 04:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
assessment we're forwarded to parents by
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
a date and the date was June uh June
 
04:48:09.350 --> 04:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
30th at the end of the fiscal year but
 
04:48:11.570 --> 04:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
since then we've also retained another
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
or not retained but a bill has to move
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
forward uh 194 release of assessment
 
04:48:20.510 --> 04:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
information that assessment information
 
04:48:23.990 --> 04:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
was the one that the the Department of
 
04:48:27.230 --> 04:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
Education has been directed to work with
 
04:48:30.770 --> 04:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
the testing agency and for the agency to
 
04:48:33.830 --> 04:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
send student results directly to the
 
04:48:33.840 --> 04:48:35.090 align:start position:0%
send student results directly to the
parent

04:48:35.090 --> 04:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
parent
 
04:48:38.830 --> 04:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that if that still didn't
 
04:48:41.868 --> 04:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
succeeds then perhaps we don't need this
 
04:48:45.050 --> 04:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
bill however I'm asking to retain it in
 
04:48:47.690 --> 04:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
case that bill does not move forward or
 
04:48:50.030 --> 04:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
if it moves forward maybe the testing
 
04:48:52.368 --> 04:48:52.378 align:start position:0%
agency also has to be told that the
 
04:48:54.650 --> 04:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
testing results are sent to the parent
 
04:48:58.250 --> 04:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
by June 30th so we've heard from the
 
04:49:00.250 --> 04:49:00.260 align:start position:0%
testing from the Department of Education
 
04:49:02.930 --> 04:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner that testing
 
04:49:05.570 --> 04:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
results are available to the schools
 
04:49:07.610 --> 04:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
immediately upon the students completing
 
04:49:08.628 --> 04:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
that test
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
so it's all online so um so I'm asking
 
04:49:15.890 --> 04:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
that we do retain this and watch what's
 
04:49:21.170 --> 04:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
going on with 194. thank you Mr chair
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:49:23.280 --> 04:49:29.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:49:29.470 --> 04:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
does anyone else having uh comments on
 
04:49:35.948 --> 04:49:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:38.090 --> 04:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
president Poland
 
04:49:40.550 --> 04:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:49:44.030 --> 04:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
um my only comment is that when we heard
 
04:49:46.990 --> 04:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill last time around
 
04:49:49.970 --> 04:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
we had a number of school districts come
 
04:49:54.410 --> 04:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
in and give us specific reasons for why
 
04:49:56.930 --> 04:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
they were holding off on sharing the
 
04:49:59.708 --> 04:49:59.718 align:start position:0%
test results until September
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
namely that they were sharing them at
 
04:50:03.948 --> 04:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
the beginning of a school year setting
 
04:50:07.250 --> 04:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
academic goals with kids and parents and
 
04:50:10.550 --> 04:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
moving forward from there so
 
04:50:12.530 --> 04:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
um I would just ask that at some point
 
04:50:15.050 --> 04:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
in time we consider whether or not there
 
04:50:19.430 --> 04:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
is any wiggle room at all in this to
 
04:50:22.970 --> 04:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
allow schools the local control aspect
 
04:50:27.530 --> 04:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
of utilizing the test reports at a time
 
04:50:29.570 --> 04:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
for a reason I'm not talking about
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
negligence or you know not getting
 
04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
around to sending them home I'm talking
 
04:50:36.650 --> 04:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
about those districts that came in and
 
04:50:39.350 --> 04:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
said we hold them because we don't want
 
04:50:41.448 --> 04:50:41.458 align:start position:0%
parents to uh
 
04:50:43.670 --> 04:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
get information that they don't have
 
04:50:46.250 --> 04:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
staff to bounce ideas off of and we use
 
04:50:49.010 --> 04:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
them for academic goals in the fall
 
04:50:50.570 --> 04:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:51:02.410 --> 04:51:02.420 align:start position:0%

we're getting to the list we have uh
 
04:52:26.150 --> 04:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
next week uh Tuesdays Tuesday and
 
04:52:28.850 --> 04:52:28.860 align:start position:0%

04:58:59.330 --> 04:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
I spoke with uh Shannon
 
04:59:01.610 --> 04:59:01.620 align:start position:0%

04:59:05.750 --> 04:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
limited with time
 
04:59:08.628 --> 04:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
who might be the best person to try
 
04:59:12.530 --> 04:59:12.540 align:start position:0%

oh no question about that yeah well
 
04:59:24.350 --> 04:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
there's no question about that I was
 
04:59:25.910 --> 04:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
just saying somebody that that had their
 
04:59:28.368 --> 04:59:28.378 align:start position:0%
feet on the ground in Connecticut which
 
04:59:30.410 --> 04:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
is one of the three examples
 
04:59:33.650 --> 04:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
um merger I I think we might get some of
 
04:59:35.690 --> 04:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
that information provided us uh from
 
04:59:38.448 --> 04:59:38.458 align:start position:0%
Barbara uh brittenham who's going to be
 
04:59:42.470 --> 04:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
coming up on Messi on on uh the
 
04:59:45.770 --> 04:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
following flight okay great great work
 
04:59:49.010 --> 04:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
with issues like this so if we see that
 
04:59:50.868 --> 04:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
we would like that there's a possibility
 
04:59:53.570 --> 04:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
we could invite somebody else in on
 
04:59:53.580 --> 04:59:55.010 align:start position:0%
we could invite somebody else in on
Friday

04:59:55.010 --> 04:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
04:59:56.330 --> 04:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to use some of that
 
04:59:58.310 --> 04:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
time to try and put something together I
 
05:00:00.890 --> 05:00:00.900 align:start position:0%

05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
great great well look forward to seeing
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
that uh that agenda anyway because I
 
05:00:07.250 --> 05:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
think that will help to sort of weigh
 
05:00:08.208 --> 05:00:08.218 align:start position:0%
out the
 
05:00:08.218 --> 05:00:11.448 align:start position:0%
