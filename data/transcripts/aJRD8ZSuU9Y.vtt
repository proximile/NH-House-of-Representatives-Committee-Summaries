hopkington so today I'm honored to
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 404 this is
 
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 align:start position:0%
legislation which as introduced in the
 
00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
Senate takes yet another very important
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
step towards addressing Child Care
 
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
shortages in New Hampshire I think as
 
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
this committee is well aware of
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
addressing Child Care shortages in New
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire remains a true economic
 
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
imperative in New Hampshire of course
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
both for our families our businesses and
 
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
really as our potential as a state to
 
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
build a modern economy that continues to
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
grow as our state ages access to Quality
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
child child care allows parents to
 
00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
remain in the workforce achieve economic
 
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
stability and contribute to the economy
 
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
but without adequate care we won't be
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
able to address the ongoing Workforce
 
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
shortages our state is facing so just
 
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
put to to put some numbers to this
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage that we frequently
 
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
talk about in the legislature currently
 
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
there are only 28 workers for every 100
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
open job positions in the state that's
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
pretty startling and I think that's why
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
you see a lot of the business Community
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
coming to the table right now to try to
 
00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 align:start position:0%
address this
 
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
problem uh I just want to throw a little
 
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
more uh numbers if you'll indulge me
 
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
there was a recent survey a national
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
survey of children's health and over
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
5,000 parents with children ages 0 to
 
00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 align:start position:0%
five reported job changes due to
 
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
problems with child care so that
 
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
includes parents who had to quit a job
 
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
not take a job or change their job
 
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
because of problems with child care for
 
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
our little our little folks ages 0er to
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
five as I mentioned the lack of
 
00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 align:start position:0%
affordable child care is also a
 
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
significant issue for New Hampshire
 
00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 align:start position:0%
businesses it is impeding our uh
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
business's ability to recruit and retain
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
a Workforce and of course to fill
 
00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 align:start position:0%
critical vacancies we see it all across
 
00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
the state this is of course limiting
 
00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the growth of our
 
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
businesses and stifling their potential
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
for economic success that's why the
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association was a
 
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
big supporter of this bill and continues
 
00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
to be a
 
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
supporter now for the startling reality
 
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
we are on the verge of a federal funding
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
Cliff as the chairman knows well in the
 
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
child care sector uh and and in
 
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
in the face of this Federal funding
 
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 align:start position:0%
Cliff New Hampshire's total childcare
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
Workforce continues to shrink our
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
Workforce behind the workforce is
 
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
shrinking and of course that decreases
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
the overall ability availability of care
 
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
for Working Families we cons continue to
 
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
see Child Care Centers lose our younger
 
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
workers due to low compensation and
 
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
benefits yet those centers in New
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who have been able who have
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
been the most effective in retaining
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
their Workforce have offered subsidized
 
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:30.919 align:start position:0%
child Child Care slots to their
 
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
employees offsetting a very significant
 
00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
expense for their workers with children
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
so now to this legislation this
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
legislation as originally introduced
 
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
allows child care workers to essentially
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
automatically qu qualify for the child
 
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
care scholarship program now I want to
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
be clear that because wages are just
 
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily low in the sector to keep
 
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
Child Care affordable for families wages
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
are so low that many individuals
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
that this program would impact already
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
qualify for the child care scholarship
 
00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:06.039 align:start position:0%
so that means we're just trying to
 
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
capture a few more families that are
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
falling through the gaps
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
here so I want to sort of C you know uh
 
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
put some more numbers to what I'm saying
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
about how low the wages are in New
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the medium hourly wage of
 
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
childcare workers is only $12.99 an hour
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
these are our folks to me Our Heroes
 
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039 align:start position:0%
that are taking care of our most
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
precious citizens our children and
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
allowing our parents to go back to work
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
right can you imagine trying to support
 
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
can't so back to the original version of
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
this bill this proposed policy change
 
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
creating this automatic eligibility for
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
childcare workers in the child care
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
scholarship program the policy as
 
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
originally introduced would also
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
streamline the process for the worker as
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
we know there's a lot of administrative
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
burden and it would also streamline the
 
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
process for the centers capturing more
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
eligible staff and reducing the
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
application burden we hear a lot and uh
 
00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:11.959 align:start position:0%
the chair speaks a lot about the
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements upon Child Care
 
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
Centers this is yet another way to
 
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
streamline this
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
process so I think what we're talking
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
about here is the creation of a benefit
 
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
for child care workers and this is
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
essential uh for so many different
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
reasons other states have recognized the
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of this critical attention
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
strategy and have actually implemented
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
this policy with a fair amount of
 
00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
success there are way more knowledgeable
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
people that can speak to what Kentucky
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
has done and others and how effective
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
that has been so I would ask you to
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
really consider this policy as
 
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
originally introduced in the Senate
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
because it's smart it's cost effective
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
and it's a really simple change that
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
could have a significant difference make
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
a significant difference for our child
 
00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
care workers and the sector at large
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
retaining needed workers recruiting
 
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
workers you know who may View Early
 
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
Education as a supportive career for
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
raising families in New Hampshire um I
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
want to note that the bill as introduced
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
um in HHS we did amend it uh that
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
version passed H uh the Senate HHS
 
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously and then on the
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
floor uh with a Voice vote um and I
 
00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:23.959 align:start position:0%
would ask the committee to consider
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
reinstating sort of the guts of the bill
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
either as introduced or as passed by
 
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services not as as it
 
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839 align:start position:0%
is coming over to you today you will see
 
00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:35.079 align:start position:0%
that it was essentially gutted um and
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
that's what you have before you so I
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
would ask you to go back to the original
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced or again as passed
 
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
out of HHS I am happy to attempt to take
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions but again there are so many
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
folks behind me who know the sector so
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
much better than me thank you very much
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
for your time today and I respectfully
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
ask for the committee supportive set
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 404 yes representative wner is
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you uh senator
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
Whitley how how was the bill
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
different what passed out of um Health
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
and Human Services as to how it came
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
into the committee it came into the
 
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
committee as yeah it came into the
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
committee as you know uh actually
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
creation of this benefit um going
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
forward permanently and what came out of
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
HHS was more of a pilot program thank
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
you for that question um I I had think
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
basically the same question is if you
 
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
could just briefly just run through
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
like what happened to this thing because
 
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
it is so different than than I mean Bas
 
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate passed a nothing burger at
 
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
the end of it um what your's not more
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
mine Mr chair it it anybody who can read
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
um what what happened I know it's not on
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
you as an individual but like can you
 
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
just like go through like what happened
 
00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
here because I don't speaking personally
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
I don't even want to look at the way it
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
was presented because it's it's like a
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
nothing burer so like what happened than
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so there was broad
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
support for the policy and there was a
 
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
lot of work done in HHS so I think
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
policy-wise the Senate is in full
 
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
support I think um because we are in in
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
a I'm not on Senate Finance but my
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is that because there
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
wasn't a clear sense of the revenues
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
going into the spring and summer that
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
this was sort of a placeholder um so I
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
would it's not that the Senate doesn't
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
support the policy they very much do
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
pass in a Voice vote but my sense is
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
that because of sort of the lack of
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
clarity so early on in the year on
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
revenues is why this that sort of as you
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
said nothing Burger was passed as a
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
placeholder okay uh any further I'm
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
paig so my understanding is that there
 
00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:44.839 align:start position:0%
were a lot of assumptions maybe faulty
 
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
assumptions um that went into the fiscal
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
note on the original bill can you maybe
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
outline some of those assumptions yeah
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't I wouldn't characterize
 
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
them as faulty at all but I think it is
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
worth sort of exploring in um one thing
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
I think is and you know Karen Ebert and
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
other folks from the Department have
 
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
worked you know really hard on this
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
policy but I think it is important to
 
00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:10.519 align:start position:0%
think through who we're talking about
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
and how many families right so again a
 
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:16.839 align:start position:0%
we're trying to create this benefit for
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
child care workers to automatically qu
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
qualify for the child care scholarship
 
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
program but a lot of those folks already
 
00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
do like I want to be clear about that a
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
lot of them already do and also not not
 
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
every single child care worker in the
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
state has children right so then we have
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
to think about of those that sort of
 
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
fall through the crack don't already
 
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
qualify how many of those
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
families of those workers actually have
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
children so that's that's another
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
important consideration to Think Through
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
about how many people we're actually
 
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
talking about because many of our
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
childcare workers you know we have folks
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
older older folks in the sector but what
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is retain those
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
younger folks that do do have children
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
and so folks behind me can sort of
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
describe that but I think you're right
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
that we need to sort of push through um
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
you know the assumptions on the fiscal
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
note and think through you know the the
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
small amount of families that we're
 
00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
actually talking about here thank you
 
00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:12.590 align:start position:0%
actually talking about here thank you
for

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
that um any other questions I yes
 
00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:17.470 align:start position:0%
that um any other questions I yes
representative

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
wner so the the pilot program that came
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
out of Health and Human
 
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
Services was there new assumptions used
 
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
for that fiscal note and if so what were
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
they I believe so and I will I I believe
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that question and I
 
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:33.759 align:start position:0%
will defer to the department behind me
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
on those thank
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
you any other questions and we are going
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
to talk to the Department of the fiscal
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
note because it's
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
like it's interesting math um any other
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee uh thank
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
you hello committee I'd like to thank
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
you guys for listening and and just
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
being a part of this change in child
 
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
care my name is coralin hoppy I'm the
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
executive director of Rochester child
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
care I currently am licensed for
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
170 early learning from six months to 5
 
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
years and then I can be licensed up to
 
00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
400 currently my school age program but
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
right now we have a about
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
241 uh I'm coming here with three
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
different kind of perspective stories
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
one is as a parent one is as a business
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
owner or a business a nonprofit business
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
executive and then another one is from a
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
child care worker so when I was a parent
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
well I'm still a parent back when I was
 
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
a younger
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
parent and I had two kids in child care
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
I went to the child care field to help
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
subsidize that cost um my husband is an
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
master electrician working for the union
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
and even with the 50% off my child care
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
for two kids in child care we constantly
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
struggled we even struggled to pay our
 
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
electric bill we struggled to pay our
 
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
housing and this was back in two
 
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
2016 so even then I felt the struggle as
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
a parent having to choose between uh
 
00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
paying my electric bill or getting
 
00:16:20.749 --> 00:16:20.759 align:start position:0%
groceries for my children my Center that
 
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
I currently work for was the place where
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
I also received my child care so the
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
money came directly out of my check so
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
that was money I never saw but it was
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
was completely debilitating if anything
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
ever happened if my car needed a repair
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
or we got into some sort of debt or for
 
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
example at my HOA right now we are
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
currently assessed with a special fee
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
this can be this is a $500 fee added
 
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
onto my bill so right now I'm in a
 
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
position where it's much better off and
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
I don't have the struggle that I used to
 
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
but now I am watching my Workforce go
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
through the same struggle that I went
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
through they often times have to choose
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
between getting a repair done to their
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
car or having suitable Child Care
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes they try to do subpar care
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
where they go in between family members
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
but really the child is the one who is
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
heavily affected by this constant change
 
00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:11.799 align:start position:0%
our children are heavily affected by our
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
self-regulation so I'm going to quote my
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
program director for my early learning a
 
00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:18.789 align:start position:0%
program director for my early learning a
well-regulated

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
well-regulated
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
teacher only can support a
 
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:start position:0%
well-regulated child or help support
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
children regulating themselves our
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
teachers are not in a good spot right
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
now I pay my le teacher 17 to $22 an
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
hour New Hampshire fiscal policy
 
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
Institute highlights that a $23 an hour
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
is our wage that we're really competing
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
against that's the medium rage for the
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire so I am not able
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
to compete with McDonald's or Target in
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
fact I have to figure out other ways to
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
subsidize costs to help support my
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
Workforce but this is getting harder and
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
harder I have a uh teacher who does not
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
have a child but currently is had a
 
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
house that was bought up by a developer
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
and her rent used to be $900 her rent is
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
now three grand so it doesn't matter how
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
many jobs you find that increase is not
 
00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:11.799 align:start position:0%
something she can withstand and on top
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
of this if this was to happen with a
 
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
child what kind of devastating effect
 
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
that would have on its develop on their
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
development and on the Family's
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
development so I come to you as a
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
business owner if I'm able to subsidize
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
the cost of this care I can then put my
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
money into wages
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
I will increase my wages I can increase
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
my capacity I can then afford more
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
Insurance my insurance has almost
 
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
tripled liability insurance is a
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
nightmare right now just to access as a
 
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
child care provider so if I had this
 
00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:45.799 align:start position:0%
cost subsidized I would be able to find
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
better Insurance perhaps or I would be
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
able to offer more benefits like family
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
health insurance to help maintain my
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce but unfortunately we're still
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
in a spot where we're just trying to
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
make it by thanks to the scholarship
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
increases and the eligibility increases
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
we will heal but because of the mass
 
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
losses that we saw this year it's going
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
to take much longer than I ever
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
predicted so when you allow for this
 
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
kind of subsidizing to happen through
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
the state I can better predict my Trends
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
I know coming in I have four employees
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
who have who need infant care which this
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
is a true fact I have three employees
 
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
going out on maternal leave and I need
 
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
infant care for three I would then be
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
able to afford that cost and Trend that
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
in and be able to offer that care and
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
then when I'm able to Trend better I
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
might be able to offer more infant care
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
to outside community members but until
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
then it's really watching it month to
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
month and responding to business month
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
to month which isn't always good when
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with children in their
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
families so um I come to you as a mother
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
I come to you as a worker and I come to
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
you as a business representative um
 
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
please um reconsider the Bild back when
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
it was and I'm neutral at the bill right
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
now but if we were to go back at the
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
original bill it would really help
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
improve the way that I do business and
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
the quality care I can offer to the
 
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
children because that's who's truly
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
suffering right
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
now that's it any questions other
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
committee he none thank you
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
um next up will be uh Ariel Warden and
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
Chrissy T
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
trainer from gorm all the way from C
 
00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:23.559 align:start position:0%
it's not quite your people but almost
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
thank you co committee for hearing us
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
today my name is Errol Warden I coming
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
to represent the Coos County Child Care
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
director Network and um do you want to

introduce yourself and then I'll I'm
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
Christine trainer from Little Sprouts we
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
op rate three centers in New Hampshire
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
state goodness
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm here today on behalf of the
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
directors in the North Country just
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
saying that we need action and from what
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
has come out of the Senate finance that
 
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
is not a bill with action in it we need
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to either bring the bill back
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
to its original intent or at least have
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
a pilot where you can get solid numbers
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
and support going out to Child Care
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
Centers as soon as possible the best
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
thing would have been if we were able to
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
do this 5 years ago or 2 weeks ago but
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
since we can't go back in time today
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
would be the time for Action not just uh
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
another study to postpone really what we
 
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
know we
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
need thank
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
you so I lead recruiting for our centers
 
00:21:45.269 --> 00:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
and we have not just the three in New
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we have 36 others across
 
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
several different New England states and
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
I can say that as an industry we have
 
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.950 align:start position:0%
I can say that as an industry we have
about

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
94% of this Workforce who identify as
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
female and 50% of that are identifying
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
as mom so while not all of those
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
children are aged Zer to 5 years old at
 
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
some point they are that age and being
 
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
able to add this as a benefit would not
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
only act as a retention tool but also as
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
an attraction tool to the fields because
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
as stated the wages are low um
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
especially when we look at what other
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
hourly jobs in the state of New
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is paying I think that's 2304
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
an hour so while you know our centers
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
are paying very similarly to what Kor is
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's still below like by a dollar so
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
anyway this would if if we could bring
 
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
the bill back to what it was originally
 
00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
that would be um very attractive to the
 
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
field and workers coming in thanks for
 
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
hearing my
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
me it's a question I ask of everyone
 
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions then you
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
say yes or no if you say yes then I turn
 
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
to the committee they ask questions
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
usually they don't ask and we move on
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
but so would you like to take questions
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
sure we can take are there questions
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
from the committee and then all right so
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
now sing done thank you so much
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's yeah geez yeah yeah how's your day
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
going um it's going great yeah all right

next up will be uh Michelle Merritt with
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
Michelle Merritt I'm the president at
 
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
new Futures I do have my colleague
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
Rebecca with us who you might remember
 
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
um who's often before this committee um
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
but I'm speaking to you today on behalf
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
of new Futures and some of the
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
coalitions that we work with around
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 404 for those who are not
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with new Futures we're a
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit policy and
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization we've served as
 
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's kids count organization
 
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
since 2016 there was a kids count
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
organization in every state and new
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
Futures is the New Hampshire designate
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
um over the past year again we've worked
 
00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
with a group of Community Partners and
 
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to identify policy
 
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
priorities in the early childhood space
 
00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
specifically to address issues um around
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
childcare Workforce and Workforce
 
00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:28.950 align:start position:0%
childcare Workforce and Workforce
Development

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
Development
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
so presently again you've heard some of
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
this because I know that you've been
 
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799 align:start position:0%
going around the state New Hampshire has
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
a vacancy rate in child care of around
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
26% the impact of this is that many
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
providers are suppressing enrollment
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
well below their license capacity
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
because they simply do not have the
 
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
teachers to be able to fill the rooms
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
and operate the classroom a common
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
experience that we've heard anecdotally
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
in convening some of these uh Partners
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
together is that there is a struggle to
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
retain younger workers um who often
 
00:24:59.789 --> 00:24:59.799 align:start position:0%
leave to take positions in the public
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
school system where the compensation and
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
the benefits are more robust um the data
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
available on the Early Childhood
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce really does support this
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
experience um workers between the ages
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
of 20 and 24 represent the largest share
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
of the workforce about 23% of childcare
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
workers fall within that age bracket
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
however if you were to look at the next
 
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
age bracket um by the age of 25 more
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
than half of these workers leave the
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
field um and again it's because they're
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
taking positions that have either
 
00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
greater pay or greater benefits the
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
average child care worker in the state
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire makes around $32,000 a
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
year and if they had an infant and a
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
four year-old these are just using
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide averages they're going to be
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
paying about $28,000 a year for the care
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
of those kids um staying in the
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
workforce in this situation is really
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
tough for these individuals they have to
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
make a choice in some cases of paying
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
their entire salary for child care and
 
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
that just economically does not make
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
sense for individuals and their
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
families centers who been the most
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
successful of retaining workers in this
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
age bracket have offered subsidized
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
Child Care slots for their employees who
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
have kids under the age of five or under
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
the age of six specifically um Kentucky
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
took note of this um it was raised by
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley um during the pandemic
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
they use some of their flexible funding
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
to Pilot Child Care Subsidy for child
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
care workers um this program was so
 
00:26:25.389 --> 00:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
successful that they ended up making it
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
permanent um it aligns to closer to 500%
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
of FPL I believe but again this strategy
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
was something that Kentucky codified um
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
as a result of some of the early
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
outcomes and results that they were
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
seeing around Workforce retention so as
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
introduced Senate Bill 404 took the lead
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
of Kentucky we were trying to make sure
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
that we were having something that would
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
work for New Hampshire that offered a
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
similar benefit to New Hampshire's
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
childcare workers given the crisis that
 
00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:51.559 align:start position:0%
we're facing with Recruitment and
 
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
Retention um unfortunately the concept
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
as even though it was unanimously
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
supported by the Senate Health and Human
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
Serv Services committee pass the floor
 
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
without objection um was amended in
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
Senate Finance to be significantly
 
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
scaled back um we have concerns that at
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
this point as it's currently before you
 
00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:11.799 align:start position:0%
the bill contains absolutely no promise
 
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
of this concept ever seeing the light of
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
day in New Hampshire um given the fact
 
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
that this is where we are where the
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates that we're seeing um
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
challenges in opening classrooms this is
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
unacceptable um we urge this committee
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
to consider amendments that would revive
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
the underlying concept to bring it back
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
to what it was that the Senate Health
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
and Human Services committee recommended
 
00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
um that The Advocates and others had
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
worked with the Department to put
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
forward that we believe if we can get
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
back to that language this is not only
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
an Innovative but it's truly a coste
 
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
effective solution to some of the real
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
challenges that we're facing in this
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
state right now around childcare
 
00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
Workforce so I'm happy to take questions
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
and again new Futures is happy to also
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
work with this committee around
 
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
amendments um to bring that concept back
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay other questions from the committee
 
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:05.240 align:start position:0%

name Megan Bray
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
back um thank you all for having me
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
today my name is Megan brabeck I live in
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
New Market and I am here today
 
00:28:29.389 --> 00:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
representing the thousands of save the
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
children Action Network supporters
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
across the state scan is the advocacy
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
arm of save the children and we are
 
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
building bipartisan support to make sure
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
every child has a strong start in life
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
and that includes working to ensure kids
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
have access to early childhood education
 
00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:46.519 align:start position:0%
right here in New Hampshire and across
 
00:28:46.519 --> 00:28:47.350 align:start position:0%
right here in New Hampshire and across
the

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
country as you've heard New Hampshire is
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing a child care crisis um I
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
won't reiterate a lot of the points that
 
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
have already been made but there are
 
00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
vacancies in the workforce
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of child care is unaffordable
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
for people in the workforce and outside
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
of the workforce um which means that
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that has Ripple effects
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
across the economy um of our whole
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
state high quality early childhood
 
00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
education prepares children for a
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
lifetime of learning but so many kids
 
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
especially ones from lower income
 
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
families never get that opportunity the
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
childcare industry needs significant
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
long-term invest Investments to give
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
every child access to high high quality
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
affordable Early Learning and ensure
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
that the workforce is well trained and
 
00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:33.430 align:start position:0%
that the workforce is well trained and
fairly

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
compensated sp404 as originally
 
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
introduced was an Innovative approach to
 
00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
this issue again as you've heard
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
um this bill as you I don't want to
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
reiterate things you've already heard um
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
a million times um but obviously the the
 
00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
bill as originally introduced would have
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
had impacts not only on the child care
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
workers themselves and their children
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
but also families across the state as
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
many more spots at Childcare centers
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to open up for those
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
families and allow them to go back to
 
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
work as well um in its current form this
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
bill you know is really nothing much
 
00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:11.799 align:start position:0%
more than a study um without you know
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
any way to implement the Forward
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
Thinking solution so I urge you uh as my
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues have to amend this bill to
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
restore it back to its original intent
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
and I do have copies of this testimony
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
if you would like them excent yes we
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
would like copies uh there are questions
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
from the Committee hearing none thank
 
00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.750 align:start position:0%
from the Committee hearing none thank
you

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
um last up is uh Brian Clark from DHHS
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
Mr Clark I don't believe you visited us
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
before have
 
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
you uh it's my first time I think okay
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
well yes I did yes I did yes I Brian
 
00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:51.559 align:start position:0%
Clark I'm general counsel for the
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
division of economic stability and I
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
have with
 
00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
me good morning my name is Karen heer
 
00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm the director for the division of
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh so we are neutral on uh the bill
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
um so the bill as currently drafted
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
would have the department create a
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
report um and the report has no
 
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation with it so we would have
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
to use just publicly available
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
information to try and glean information
 
00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:26.519 align:start position:0%
on the effectiveness of the pilot and
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
put that into a report
 
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh I'm available for questions regarding
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
any version of the bill other questions
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh from the
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
committee uh yes representive cre um so
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
in looking at what the bill as amended
 
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:50.919 align:start position:0%
does um the report so is the pilot
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
program actually established or is it
 
00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
just a report saying what would be
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
needed to establish a pilot program I
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
believe it would be a report on what
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
would be needed and the potential
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of a pilot
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
program okay thank you representative H
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I wondered if you could um go
 
00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
through with us some of the assumptions
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
you used for the pilot that was coming
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
out of the Senate Health and Human
 
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.549 align:start position:0%
out of the Senate Health and Human
Service

00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
Service
 
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
Committee of course um so we had to use
 
00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
the best data we had to try and gather
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
the um can I stop you're asking about
 
00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
the amended the first amended version
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
would you be objectionable if I
 
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
preempted your question and go to the
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
original bill because before we go to
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
the not not to step on you if you're
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
okay with that yeah that's fine with me
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
you're go I'm trying to go all the way
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
back you're going two steps back so can
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
we go back to the original bill um as
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
introduced um because when I saw this
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I was it was like a a
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
campaign of shock and awe
 
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
of so like the total scholarship fund is
 
00:33:07.149 --> 00:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
like $26 million roughly right um from
 
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
the feds how the hell do we get to $26
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
million just by adding Child Care
 
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
employees that are not already covered
 
00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
like it just seems I'm not trying to be
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
rude here but it seems like laughable on
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
face value um because like I and I've
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
read over this method ology very rudely
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
while people are testifying like five
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
times trying to figure out like how that
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
happened because it just makes no sense
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
so the at the um introduced version of
 
00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:42.919 align:start position:0%
the bill as written would
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
have child care workers categorically
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for the full benefit of child
 
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
care scholarship okay um
 
00:33:55.629 --> 00:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
so it did not just add uh workers who
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
were not already eligible that is what
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
the as amended by the Health and Human
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
Services version did so they took the
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
ones the ones was very they took the the
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
workers who are currently covered and
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
they included them in that
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
bucket yes yes so in the so the question
 
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
is what would the uh introduced version
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill um with no Amendments have
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
done it would have made every worker it
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
would have shifted the funding source
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
from the for those workers from the
 
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
state scholarship fund to the general
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
fund and because we wouldn't have been
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
able to guarantee compliance with
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements of 85% under 85% of
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
the state median income it would have
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
been entirely General
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
funds okay all right thank you so that
 
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
anwers the first question because I I I
 
00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
read that and I was just like somebody
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
is we haven't legalized it yet you know
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
what I mean um so um all right so now we
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
can go to representative wal's question
 
00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
about the amended
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
version just just I wondered what
 
00:34:59.950 --> 00:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
assumption you were using for the pilot
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
the pilot that came out of Health and
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
Human Services in the
 
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
Senate okay so we used um American
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
Community survey uh Census Data uh to
 
00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%
estimate the likelihood that workers
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
would be eligible um Bas and have
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
children within the age ranges that
 
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
could receive child care scholarship so
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
one of the assumptions was that child
 
00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
care workers would be no more or less
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
likely than other persons in New
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to have children and that
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
their age ranges would be the same
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
um we made the assumption that um only
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
two income households would have income
 
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
over 85% of the state median income
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
based on the assumption that if the
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
average wage of a childcare worker is uh
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
122 to $13 an hour that they would
 
00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
already have qualified so it was really
 
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
only married
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
households um or partnered households
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
that would need the uh categorical
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility pilot so we made that
 
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
assumption um and narrowing down uh the
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
impacted yes go ahead sorry rip some I'm
 
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
having College flashbacks here I'm sorry
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
um so when you're doing your those
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
assumptions and you're estimating how
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
much funding this would need for the
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
pilot did you also um put into
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
consideration that the
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
um workers who would be
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
eligible it would be above the
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
85% um would they also did you also
 
00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
factor out that they would pay 7% of
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
their income towards the tuition yes we
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
did uh so we also we reduced the benefit
 
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
by an expected household income for that
 
00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.150 align:start position:0%
by an expected household income for that
range

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
range
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
and then we also cut out some households
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
with potentially really high incomes
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't have an incentive
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
to apply for a program if there would be
 
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
no benefit so yes we did that too thank
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
you okay great is it possible to do you
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
still have all that um fiscal note that
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
the work that went into that do you have
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
that available yeah we can send that to
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh clearly this is going to need work so
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let my Subs go we're not
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
going to vote on this today we will we
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
will execute uh we will execute so we
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
can work on it but they can go off to
 
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:35.079 align:start position:0%
Edna because this is clearly not
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
happening today so um want to thank you
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
guys for your time appreciate it your
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
services are no longer necessary your
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
services um we will be entering into
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
executive session we will not be calling
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
a vote so so you know um actually I
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
don't even think we have a majority I
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
couldn't call a vote if I let them go if
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%

uh so you know just sen W I'm going to
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
schedule because this is an early bill

it has to be out uh by next week so I am
 
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:08.680 align:start position:0%

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to send that off before the
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
missed yes just kidding you're more than
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
welcome to hang sub for the day you're
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
more than welcome to stay uh just don't
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
need to hold you here
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
needlessly yes thank you I just wanted
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
to uh point out that if a reinstatement
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
of previous language or previous
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
amendment is going to be considered uh
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
just to note that if we were to initiate
 
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.309 align:start position:0%
just to note that if we were to initiate
a

00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
pilot it would require system changes
 
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
which we will not be able to implement
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
until January 1st of 2025
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
if we want a one-year pilot that would
 
00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
be the effective date for that pilot or
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
however a many year the year uh the
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
number of years for that Amendment uh I
 
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:12.440 align:start position:0%
think we selected two and a half years
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to collect robust
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
enough data to really have a solid
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
understanding of the outcomes to see the
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
value of such uh a program so that was
 
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
the reason for the length of that
 
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.349 align:start position:0%
the reason for the length of that
particular

00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
uh so that should be uh something to
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
keep in mind but the effective date was
 
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
really important for
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
us further question I guess cretion
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm um write an email with that in
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
mind would there be a benefit to
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
skipping the pilot entirely and just
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
program that that that's up to the
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
committee I think
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
yeah in terms of collection and things
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
like that would that simplify things on
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
your end if you didn't need
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
sooner uh we wouldn't be able to
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
initiate even a permanent program any
 
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
committee all right um seeing none thank
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
you um is there anyone else who wishes
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
to speak to Senate Bill
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
404 all right see uh Mr Clark can you
 
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
grab me that blue sheet over there since
 
00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
I let my entire right flank go L thank
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
spoke there were two people signed in uh
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
who did not speak who were neutral on
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
the bill um online for the
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
house I I saw I read the Senate report
 
00:40:59.710 --> 00:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
earlier it was overwhelming like 400
 
00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:03.079 align:start position:0%
something but uh in the house Senate
 
00:41:03.079 --> 00:41:04.109 align:start position:0%
something but uh in the house Senate
Bill

00:41:04.109 --> 00:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
404 was n support to oppose and 55
 
00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
neutral a lot of neutral think I've ever
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
seen that many neutral um with that I'm
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 404 I'm going to open the
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
executive session for Senate Bill 404
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
like I said we're not taking a vote but
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about this UMES wner
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
comments well I I would definitely like
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
to see us do the do a pilot and take a
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
look at the amendment that came out of
 
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate the um first the first
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that came out of the Senate
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
out of Health and Human Services not
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
this one not the one that's before us
 
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
not not that one I I would like to have
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
us go forth with that I don't how much
 
00:41:55.309 --> 00:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
let me asking that one more
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
question okay objection so how much was
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that the Health and
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
Human Services senate committee how much
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
needed uh so Brian Clark on behalf of
 
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
the department general counsel division
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe that's
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
correct 2.5 and how did it break down
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
how much was would actually be the
 
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
benefit for the workers and how much for
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
do okay get
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
there so it would have been
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
$122 and8 a week1 times the number of
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
yeah times the number of workers uh
 
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
which we estimated or not the number of
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
workers to the number of children who
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
are eligible uh which we estimated to be
 
00:43:18.319 --> 00:43:23.470 align:start position:0%
are eligible uh which we estimated to be
between

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:31.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
great and how much of the total
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
appropriation was 2.5 million for was
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
the total how much was how much is for
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
the direct benefit for the family for
 
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
the families and how much is
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
Administration by the Department of
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services so it was
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
$250,000 for system changes
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
um other than that we didn't have
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
administrative costs because it would
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
use our existing Child Care scholarship
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
you all right any other questions before
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
we let Mr Clark go all right thank you
 
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:18.750 align:start position:0%
we let Mr Clark go all right thank you
okay

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
um you're
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
ask they from new future still here yes
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they are yes can I ask her yeah
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
fine thank you for coming up again I'm
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
sorry I was so busy typing but I didn't
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
make answer the question um I was just
 
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could tell us a little
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
bit more about the pilot program in
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
Kentucky and um how much that ended up
 
00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
sort of cosing and what were the sort of
 
00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
outcomes that they saw that made them
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
choose to yeah hold on to it permanently
 
00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
you want to Jo me if you have other
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
information it might be something that
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
we can supply the committee afterwards
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
obviously the way that things are set up
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
in different states is significantly
 
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
different also the population in
 
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
Kentucky is much larger than New
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there would be some work
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
that would need to go into determining
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
some of that like how it would compare
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
to a population of our size but yeah and
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
I'll say one distinction in Kentucky is
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
that they used a lot of State funds to
 
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
allow true categorical eligibility for
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
all childcare workers so it's distinct
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
and different so the costs would be
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
vastly more than what we're looking at
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
here so what was proposed here is really
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
our own New Hampshire approach to
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
something that is going to be beneficial
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
overall I'm happy to send you some
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
information on the Kentucky um pilot
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
program how it was implemented and then
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
actually the finalized statute as well
 
00:45:41.069 --> 00:45:41.079 align:start position:0%
if that is of interest to you great yeah
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
so the only thing that I'll add again is
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
that as the bill was originally
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
introduced it was this Kentucky type of
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
a model um in order to contain some of
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
the costs in New Hampshire we went with
 
00:45:55.549 --> 00:45:55.559 align:start position:0%
a the the pilot the amendment was a
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
cascading eligibility
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
um that then essentially took
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship added additional steps
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
beyond the the 85% Cliff for scholarship
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
and only those that were child care
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
workers would continue to receive some
 
00:46:11.549 --> 00:46:11.559 align:start position:0%
level of essentially a scholarship but
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
be paid with General funds after that
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
amount until it phased out with the
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
steps so it was leaning into the
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
existing structure of the state
 
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship program in New Hampshire and
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
that's the substantial difference
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
between as it was originally introduced
 
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
and what the pilot is there's no reason
 
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
in my personal opinion why we couldn't
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
do that same thing that's contained in
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
the Pilot in that version as it came out
 
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
of Senate Health and Human Services and
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
make it permanent if that is something
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
that the committee would like to do um
 
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
but it is vastly different from the
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
original to the the second version the
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
second version definitely maximizes use
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
of existing state funds um and leans
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
into the state scholarship program
 
00:46:53.760 --> 00:47:02.190 align:start position:0%
into the state scholarship program
design

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry deep in thought here I have
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
another question for the Department if I
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry let can't get first time up we
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
can't get enough I know I just as I was
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
just you're wearing the if you you're
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
Indianapolis people would be upset you
 
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
I'm from Indiana originally Indiana Oh
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
that's why I have a cult lanyard oh um
 
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
we root for the Patriots and
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
oh is that s
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
um so since the even the pilot can't
 
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
start until
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
January of 25 that's correct all we need
 
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
bium is six months of
 
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
funding six months of funding and uh
 
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
$250,000 for the system changes yes all
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
we really need is an
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation for not 2. 5 million but
 
00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.910 align:start position:0%
appropriation for not 2. 5 million but
we

00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
need somewhat less than that we need
 
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
about a lot about
 
00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:10.839 align:start position:0%
120 mli about 1.2
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
million uh I I believe it's a little
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
more than that like 1.3 or four okay
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
because the 250 yeah okay okay so it is
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.349 align:start position:0%
 
hold

00:48:34.349 --> 00:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
hold
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
so yes the the appropriation was for uh
 
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
the high end of the estimate um and so
 
00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:08.839 align:start position:0%
we estimated a range and they
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
appropriated the high end of the
 
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.630 align:start position:0%
appropriated the high end of the
potential

00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
cost and they did it for a year half a
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
year uh well they only did it for half a
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
year whole
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
why just uh while you're looking that up
 
00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079 align:start position:0%
I know the original Bill factored we
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
said the original Bill factored in the
 
00:49:36.789 --> 00:49:36.799 align:start position:0%
workers who are already on the
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship in that
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
number we don't have to include them
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
they could stay on the existing
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship or do they have to come off
 
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
that yeah that's where the amendment
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
came in we felt we
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
could Cascade as was a word used earlier
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
so that if you qualify for the
 
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship then you should receive the
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
um but those who were over income with a
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship we zeroed down the number of
 
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.870 align:start position:0%
scholarship we zeroed down the number of
possible

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:50:10.589 --> 00:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
participants what we also did was looked
 
00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:13.559 align:start position:0%
at because we wouldn't be able to start
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
until halfway through the fiscal year
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 funding was for six
 
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
months of that pilot and then we wanted
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
a robust pilot enough to collect
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
sufficient data making it a two and
 
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
pilot so for the first six months yes it
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
is so who qualifies for the pilot
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
program okay so I I don't mean the
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
workers I mean how do we determine
 
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
who is on is it a selective pilot or is
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
it a free-for-all on the state like what
 
00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.349 align:start position:0%
it a free-for-all on the state like what
is

00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
it so by Pilot We meant it would be
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
initially running for two and a half
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
years okay so it's not a pilot program
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's just starting this up for for 2 and
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
a half years so Pilot's not really a
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
yeah we didn't limit it to a specific
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
region of the state or otherwise it's a
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
Statewide two and a half year program if
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
a yeah Worker Works 25 hours a week at
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
an eligible provider um they could apply
 
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
yeah there's nothing more permanent than
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
um so the I don't even want to call it
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
the pilot program because like the just
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
like makes my blood boil the uh the
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
scale down program or the one that's
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know's call let's call it
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
um that one it cascaded down and it hits
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
like a is it hits a minimum benefit at
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
some point or at some point you're just
 
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
no longer
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
eligible um so the pilot program the
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
option b as you called it had a 7% cost
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
share like the child care um scholarship
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
so if a family started making enough
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
money that their cost share would be
 
00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
higher than the cost of paying privately
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
for child care we just kind of assumed
 
00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be
 
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
interested yeah so 7% of their um gross
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
income for the for the family
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
yes do math um okay sorry you do your
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
math I'm going to do my math here real
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
fast so there's no income limit per se
 
00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:33.030 align:start position:0%
fast so there's no income limit per se
but

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:35.309 --> 00:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
yeah it would kind of depend on the age
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.549 --> 00:53:11.559 align:start position:0%
any other questions from Mr CL for for
 
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
the DHS while we hold them hostage
 
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
here um okay thanks thank you well I'm I
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
we reserve the right to drag you back up
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
500% go back to the Chart oh I just
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
closed the whole chart oh that
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
sucks can I bring it back up yes I can
 
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.510 align:start position:0%
sucks can I bring it back up yes I can

shs um here we
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
go they are they're like yeah they're
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
like bye just they didn't really say

your by the way in case guys wondering
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
like just uh this is the Smoke Filled
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
time my niece name Paige all right
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
there's page
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
okay represent Pat I just texted you the
 
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:22.589 align:start position:0%
okay represent Pat I just texted you the
link

00:55:22.589 --> 00:55:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
thank okay
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
so a couple things let's not call it a
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
pilot program because we all know it's
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
not um let's just like be be
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
intellectually honest for a second we
 
00:55:43.029 --> 00:55:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
um my only my my only concern outside of
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
the fact that i' I'd have to when it
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
came to the floor I'd have to file cage
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
V paperwork um but
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
the I I I guess my only concern is like
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
are we you know and there there's so few
 
00:55:59.029 --> 00:55:59.039 align:start position:0%
of them I don't even know if it's worth
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
raising raising the prospect of it but
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's like if you make $225,000 why are
 
00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
we subsidizing you um but I don't think
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
that's the point of it it's more of a
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
try to get people into the workforce
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
yeah if I may I feel like the issue is
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
is do we want teachers in classrooms
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
yeah no it's a fair I rais the point I
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
like is that is that really even how
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking at it at this point cuz um
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
you know $72,000 so so currently a
 
00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:27.559 align:start position:0%
single mother working in childcare would
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
be covered up to $72,000 of some benefit
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
um right does anybody refute that um no
 
00:56:38.589 --> 00:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
okay um so we're we're really talking
 
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
about what happens when they start
 
00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:42.039 align:start position:0%
making more which if they're working in
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
child care they're probably no longer in
 
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
yes I think the issue is people who are
 
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
married yeah that's what I'm about to
 
00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
talk that's what I'm about to raise yeah
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
income household issue that when the
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
individual childcare workers income
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
starts to like not keep Pace with the
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
cost of care that they bow out and so
 
00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
that is the population really that we're
 
00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
trying to capture with this particular
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
program a lot of the childcare workers
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
will fall under the 85% of SMI in the
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
existing program it's the Dual income
 
00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
households that are having the workers
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
that have to make the choice of one
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
person leaving and the person that often
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
would leave is the mom and the child
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
care worker so if we can keep them in
 
00:57:33.029 --> 00:57:33.039 align:start position:0%
there I if that family unit right now
 
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
made over
 
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 that worker is coming out of
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
the workforce because they have no
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
scholarship they would not be eligible
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
um so those are the types of situations
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to capture with this
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
particular program yeah know that that's
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
the point I was about to raise is we're
 
00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
not really we're not really talking I I
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
keep thinking about the single mom with
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
one kid in the child care center right
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
but reality is that she is likely
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
covered already
 
00:57:59.950 --> 00:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
by this um so we to that point we really
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
are talking about either multiple kids
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
um or we've got a high income um doesn't
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
have necessarily be a spouse because
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't have to be married
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess the question is so we're
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
really talking about families of three
 
00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:21.799 align:start position:0%
that make more than $90,000 a
 
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
year right well I'm looking at the sheet
 
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of cheating um to be fair $
 
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
um let's go back to the fiscal note on
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
version Oh that's the Senate notes I've
 
00:58:53.309 --> 00:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
billed by the Senate
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
why did
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
they why did they do this horrible
 
00:59:00.839 --> 00:59:01.670 align:start position:0%
they why did they do this horrible
Second

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
Second
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment I love the Second Amendment
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
but why did they do the horrible this
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
second third amend yes so that that will
 
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
be used against me in some hitpiece why
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
did they do the second amendment's
 
00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:19.870 align:start position:0%
did they do the second amendment's
horrible

00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a that's a question
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
for Senator Bradley I think well I tried
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
I I wasn't trying to I wasn't trying to
 
00:59:28.589 --> 00:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
throw cender Whitley under the bus cuz I
 
00:59:29.789 --> 00:59:29.799 align:start position:0%
she clearly made it known she didn't
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
support and I I did look up the vote
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
count she did not vote for the the the
 
00:59:36.029 --> 00:59:36.039 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment to the bill um the vote
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
was 1311 in the Senate um let's read
 
00:59:39.359 --> 00:59:41.390 align:start position:0%
was 1311 in the Senate um let's read
their

00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
reports they literally didn't write
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.270 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
okay so it it's going to hit a default
 
01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
no because it's 7% of their
 
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
income okay
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
um let's get an amendment together to
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
bring back the second version of it that
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the laughable $18 million
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
funding note on it um I'll take get to
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
my caucus when they decide that they
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
want to come back to committee
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
um um let's get that drafted I don't
 
01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
want my name to go on it because it's a
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
be a benefit directly for my employees
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
to be fair just one of them but um so I
 
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
don't like that just seems very self-
 
01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:43.640 align:start position:0%
serving um and then we'll meet back up
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
here next Wednesday at 10: a.m. um and
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
if we have any changes I'll let
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
Representative wner no um but I think
 
01:01:04.589 --> 01:01:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
I wondered what you were going to do
 
01:01:08.029 --> 01:01:08.039 align:start position:0%
about the appropriation maybe we should
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
talk to the department about whether
 
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
because it
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
does it is only for six
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
months well it's for six months and then
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
after that well we we not 2.3 this isn't
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
the state doing really well right now
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
well which one is it which one is it
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
today are we are we broke or are we
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
flush I can't remember which press
 
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
release went out I mean it'll it'll end
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
up being a budget discussion I think
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
yeah in the in the future I think what
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
you need is the
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
first the first um hit of money to get
 
01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:45.039 align:start position:0%
it up and
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
running which is one
 
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
2.55 right that's the appropriation for
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
it minus a
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
$250,000 setup fee which quar million
 
01:01:58.990 --> 01:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
dollar setup fee is a hell of a setup
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
fee but
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh she uh start bidding on those things
 
01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:04.549 align:start position:0%
uh she uh start bidding on those things
so

01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
$250,000 to add some names in seems a
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
little uh aggressive but okay um because
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
he uses NH connections right so it's all
 
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
it's all Salesforce I imagine no it's
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
not good good because otherwise I used
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
to work with
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
Salesforce um anyways I
 
01:02:24.029 --> 01:02:24.039 align:start position:0%
think I I mean the reality is the states
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
either going to fund it or it's not like
 
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
because are are you talking about when
 
01:02:28.269 --> 01:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
you talking about getting the more
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate approachs like what are you
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
talking about what's
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
your what do you mean by that I think
 
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
it's high right I think yeah I I think
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
it's high how high do you think it
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
is well is it is the 2.5 million was
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
that for was that for one full year or a
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
half a
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
year one full year but you aren't going
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
to be functioning this Pilot EX except
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
half right until it's the next
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
budget right it
 
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
says the sum of 2.3 for fiscal year
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
ending June 30th
 
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
2025 or we could just leave this to the
 
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
finance committee that's what I wanted
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
to do that's what I wanted to do why
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
didn't we just yeah that's what I wanted
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
to do it and they can figure out what
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
they want to do with the money if they
 
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
have it or not
 
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
um because it's amazing what they'll
 
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
fund or what they won't F if you're
 
01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
really just looking at fiscal year 25
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
and then something that would be perhaps
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the state's budget I
 
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
think it I think that's the way it would
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
have to work actually I don't think that
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
don't I think that's difficult if it's a
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
pilot program I know we we're not
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
wanting to use that word nothing more
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
permanent nothing more permanent than a
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
temporary program program there could I
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that it's it's
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
clear there I would want an opportunity
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
to evaluate other costs of administering
 
01:04:03.269 --> 01:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
a permanent program for a pilot is
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
different because we're looking at
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
instituting things like audits Fair
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
Hearings and a pro and being able to
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
administer it from that perspective I
 
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure there may not be
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
anything else but I just want to make
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
sure if we're looking at it from a more
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
permanent uh basis that we have an
 
01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to evaluate that
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
yes for so if you
 
01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.349 align:start position:0%
yes for so if you
have

01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
24 or
 
01:04:35.279 --> 01:04:36.870 align:start position:0%
24 or
2.5

01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
2.5
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
appropriated for six
 
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
months but you only
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
have six months to spend
 
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
it you would anticipate that you're
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
going to have money at the end of the
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
six months is it non-aps is that have
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
you written that into it that it's not
 
01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:04.839 align:start position:0%
lapsing yes so nailed it okay so it
 
01:05:08.109 --> 01:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
would half of it would come over into
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
the next six
 
01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
months so you've only really got a
 
01:05:12.039 --> 01:05:15.230 align:start position:0%
months so you've only really got a
one-year

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.430 align:start position:0%
 
pilot

01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
pilot
 
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.430 align:start position:0%
pilot
right

01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little confused which ver we're
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
talking about this bill that came out of
 
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
the house and um Senate Health and Human
 
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.510 align:start position:0%
the house and um Senate Health and Human
Services

01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
so from that particular fiscal note we
 
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
were looking at you know a range of 1.4
 
01:05:45.269 --> 01:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
to 1.6 million for fiscal year 2025
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
because we wouldn't start until January
 
01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
so the six months of the rest of fiscal
 
01:05:50.599 --> 01:05:52.230 align:start position:0%
so the six months of the rest of fiscal
year

01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
25 that range so call it 1.5 for
 
01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
year we were looking at 2.4 to 2.9 call
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
it so you want to look at I'm sorry 2.7
 
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:09.870 align:start position:0%
it so you want to look at I'm sorry 2.7
to

01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
2.9 um was the range for fiscal year
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
26 okay okay so
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
let's Russ let's just go with the way it
 
01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
came out of the Senate yeah and because
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
it once it hits Finance it'll
 
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
they'll do you guys will do what you
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
guys do in finance
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
nerds too soon all
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
right okay I understand what you're
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
saying any other comments from the four
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
four remaining members of the committee
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
on this uh on this bill um you going to
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
take the lead on this representative
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
wner who's going to take the lead on it
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
it cannot be me because I'm I'm going to
 
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
have to file conflict of interest Pap
 
01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
workk I won't vote for it on the floor I
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with committee but
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
I'll vote for I can't vote I can't vote
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
on this in I could I could declare
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
interest but I won't because it's a
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
direct government benefit to me so I
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
won't be voting for it cuz I I get
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
enough of those accusations as it is so

Republican members of this committee who
 
01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
would co-sponsor it with us uh probably
 
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh deimon would be the first one I would
 
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:15.799 align:start position:0%
think of so I can ask her can you ask

ask her she may say no she reserves the
 
01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
right to say no um but who you can ask I
 
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
I get told no all the time it's like a
