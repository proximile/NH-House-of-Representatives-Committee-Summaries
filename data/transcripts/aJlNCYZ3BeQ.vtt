so uh welcome everyone to legislative
 
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
Administration I am uh For Better or
 
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
Worse your chairman
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
um Greg Hill
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
um we have the pleasure of having
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
another chairman in the in the room at
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
one point here in this same committee
 
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:05.810 align:start position:0%
one point here in this same committee
um

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative Janet wall was chair my
 
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
first year in this committee I think
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
um and and we've alternated
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
um so last year I was the chair here as
 
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.490 align:start position:0%
um so last year I was the chair here as
well

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
um we only have seven bills
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
um which is going to be
 
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
a nice comfortable
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
time for us so that shouldn't be an
 
00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:34.519 align:start position:0%
issue we don't have to cram anything in
 
00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to give you a couple
 
00:12:41.769 --> 00:12:41.779 align:start position:0%
minutes of procedure that we use in in
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration
 
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:47.700 align:start position:0%
I have a feeling it's similar to what
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
other committees are doing but it
 
00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:52.019 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily work that way
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
um I am a stickler for time we're
 
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
already 10 minutes late here
 
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
which drives me a little crazy but I'll
 
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
get over it
 
00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:03.899 align:start position:0%
um I um
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
specifically when it comes to the public
 
00:13:09.129 --> 00:13:09.139 align:start position:0%
is when I'm more concerned
 
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
anybody that takes the time to be here I
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
I want us to be ready when if it says 10
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
o'clock for hearings I want us to be
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
here at 10 o'clock
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
if you're not
 
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
please let either Janet
 
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
Vanessa who's not here or I by the way
 
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
Janet is our vice chair and Janet is
 
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.509 align:start position:0%
Janet is our vice chair and Janet is
attending

00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
attending
 
00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
um the chairs and vice chairs have been
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
asked to attend uh what's it called
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
what do they call the active active
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
shooter training or or something the
 
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
safety training yeah yeah so what is it
 
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.790 align:start position:0%
safety training yeah yeah so what is it
called

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.690 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:03.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.370 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
um the idea is uh that Vanessa will
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
um will be here always
 
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
Deb Hobson is our clerk Deb will always
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
be there
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
uh Janet will always be there
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
but other than that
 
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
um the only other person that has an
 
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
assigned seat is uh is Steve down at the
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
end here
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
um who is going to help us if we have
 
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
any problems in the room of a disruptive
 
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.350 align:start position:0%
any problems in the room of a disruptive
nature

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
nature
 
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.530 align:start position:0%
nature
um

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:44.339 align:start position:0%
well yeah that's a problem isn't it
 
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
there's a whole nother code I gotta come
 
00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:47.339 align:start position:0%
up with
 
00:14:47.339 --> 00:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
up with
um

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
but I will be the one if there is uh if
 
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of disruption and I've
 
00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:55.820 align:start position:0%
never seen it in our committee
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
we really don't have a volatile
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
committee we don't have that kind of
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
issue but if necessary I'll have Steve
 
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
go and get one of our security people
 
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.220 align:start position:0%
um so that seat is off limits everything
 
00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.290 align:start position:0%
um so that seat is off limits everything
else

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
I would rather treat everybody as an
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
adult you can sit where you want to sit
 
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
um whatever you're comfortable with
 
00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:23.339 align:start position:0%
um if you're not comfortable where you
 
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
are then
 
00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:28.019 align:start position:0%
get up and move as far as I'm concerned
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
um the only other things that I want to
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that we know things that
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
present our appearance to the public
 
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
so you'll notice things like coffee cups
 
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:44.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
so there's a little shelf underneath
 
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.350 align:start position:0%
so there's a little shelf underneath
here

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
um that's really a great place to uh to
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
to stick stuff
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
um it uh we're supposed to look like
 
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
we're professionals we are supposed to
 
00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
look like we are here
 
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
um not to eat our bologna sandwiches
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
while people are testifying or something
 
00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
like that so
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
um if you don't mind that would be great
 
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
um I also uh will bring up a little bit
 
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
about uh the testimony when someone is
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
here testifying
 
00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:18.050 align:start position:0%
here testifying
um

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's where our attention should be
 
00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:23.420 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be
 
00:16:26.689 --> 00:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
in our computers or on our phones or
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
anything like that we are here to
 
00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
that's why they call it a public hearing
 
00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
we are here to hear from the public what
 
00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
they think
 
00:16:35.699 --> 00:16:37.210 align:start position:0%
they think
um

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:37.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
consistent with that when
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
they stop I will typically ask if they
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
would be willing to take questions
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's the time for you
 
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
to get clarification on what they're
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
telling us
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
um it's not a time to debate it's not a
 
00:16:57.069 --> 00:16:57.079 align:start position:0%
time to
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
antagonize or belittle or anything it is
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
just strictly to interpret what they're
 
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
saying and get clarification and and
 
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
then we thank them and and off they go
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that later when we do
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
exec sessions or or things like that
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
um all questions to the chair come
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
through me so
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
um you know typically what someone will
 
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
make a just eye contact and and let me
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
know that you have a question I'll make
 
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
a note of it and then I'll recognize you
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
you ask the question
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
and then if that isn't enough for you or
 
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
if you have an additional question you
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
can ask for a follow-up you know or
 
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
something along those lines and I'll
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
immediately ask you if you can go ahead
 
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
with your second question
 
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.330 align:start position:0%
with your second question
um

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
we hope to get through
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
part of the in general will back me up
 
00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
part of the hardest
 
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.909 align:start position:0%
part of the hardest
um

00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
issue with being a chair is trying to
 
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
schedule the time for how long who's
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
going to show up how long they are going
 
00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
to speak and and try to keep things
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
moving without gaps in there it's
 
00:18:15.169 --> 00:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
enormously a problem don't you think
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
yeah so I've done my best but keep an
 
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
eye on the next hearing and what time if
 
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
you have a question that is able to get
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
an answer from somebody else testifying
 
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
that would be great you know some way to
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
keep this all moving on time I love on
 
00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:36.470 align:start position:0%
keep this all moving on time I love on
time

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
um you'll notice a theme Here
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
so um beyond that I want to make sure
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
that we um
 
00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:48.059 align:start position:0%
that we act in a in a professional
 
00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:49.250 align:start position:0%
that we act in a in a professional
manner

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
manner
 
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
um I tell people in our Mark hearing
 
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
that you know you need to pretend that
 
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
your mother is sending a copy of the
 
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
tape from here you know to their the
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
family for the end of year and and you
 
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
want to present yourself in the best
 
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
possible light
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
that's what we're looking for we're
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
looking for professional and and good
 
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
questions and consistent questions if
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
there's something that you miss later on
 
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419 align:start position:0%
um or if somebody wants to come up and
 
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
testify again to clarify something we
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
typically ask for that to be emailed in
 
00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:27.419 align:start position:0%
um and and we should be getting copies
 
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
of every email that come to the
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
committee if I get it and I'm not sure
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to the committee you may see
 
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
an email from me that goes out to
 
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.010 align:start position:0%
an email from me that goes out to
everyone

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
here's the caution with that
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
if I send out an email to everyone
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
do not reply all
 
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
to come back
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
no reply all a little warning Bell
 
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
should go in your head when you hit
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
reply all on your on your email
 
00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
um what we're trying to avoid there is
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
um is a conflict with 91a the open
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
meeting law so if we get into this
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
conversation with all of us online the
 
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
public isn't able to see that so we've
 
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
got a problem there so everything comes
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
through either Vanessa or I
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
um so you know you just you can make a
 
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
comment to anything that we that goes
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
out by email but only back to us and
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
then we will direct it to someone else
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
or to or back to you or you know we we
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
can send out one-way direction to
 
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
everyone you can only send back through
 
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:37.870 align:start position:0%
us okay
 
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:38.510 align:start position:0%
us okay
[Music]

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.409 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
what else am I missing
 
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.490 align:start position:0%
what else am I missing
um

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah sure Jump Right In whenever
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I just wanted
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
to add one thing that you were talking
 
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:52.340 align:start position:0%
about when we're asking questions
 
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
sometimes people think of other things
 
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:57.059 align:start position:0%
closely related to a bill but not
 
00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
specifically the bill and then I think
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh discussions answers and all can go
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
way off in other directions so as our
 
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
chairman said in the interest of time
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
ask your main questions ones that are
 
00:21:12.409 --> 00:21:12.419 align:start position:0%
pertaining specifically to the bill
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
before us and that will help narrow down
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
our thinking and our discussions for
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
when we need to accept thank you Mr
 
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.590 align:start position:0%
when we need to accept thank you Mr
chairman

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
um so here's some other things that were
 
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
written in here by me that I neglected
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
um I've already talked uh
 
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
we will always be meeting here unless
 
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:37.940 align:start position:0%
you get a special notification from me
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
this room we share with Municipal and
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
County and
 
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
environment and nag
 
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.470 align:start position:0%
environment and nag
um

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
one is I think Municipal and county is
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays and potentially Thursdays and
 
00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
and environment nag are Tuesdays
 
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.649 align:start position:0%
and environment nag are Tuesdays
um

00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:00.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
both of those have new freshman
 
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
legislators so I've done my best to try
 
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
to stay away from them and let them make
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
their mistakes
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
in scheduling and doing everything and
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
so I tried to stay away
 
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
Monday seems to be the and and we've got
 
00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
direction from the speaker that um we he
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
wants all of these rooms Monday through
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
Friday to be available so
 
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.510 align:start position:0%
Friday to be available so
um

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
I think with just seven bills we should
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
be able to get away here with either
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
three or perhaps four meetings
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
um depending on what one of our bills
 
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
does but um so for now
 
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
um I've grabbed to get away from those
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
other committees I've grabbed Mondays
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
if that's a problem let me know
 
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.210 align:start position:0%
if that's a problem let me know
um

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
and then we'll try to see if we can fit
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
in with probably environment and AG
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
they have the lighter schedule but
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
Municipal and county has uh 40 or 50
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
bills so I'm letting them do their thing
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
and they have I think 10 or 15 early
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
bills which mean they have to be heard
 
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
before February 15th or 16th
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
because they end up going to a second
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
committee so those they've got pressure
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
on them we have no pressure on us we our
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
bills have to be completed in this
 
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.730 align:start position:0%
bills have to be completed in this
section

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:30.740 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
by March
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
15th or 16th I think it's it doesn't
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
matter 15th or 16. we've got time
 
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
so um if there's a concern if people
 
00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be able to make it
 
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
please let me know that's another theme
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
you cannot tell us too much between
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
Vanessa or I if you can't make a an
 
00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
exact session
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
Republicans will tell Vanessa or I
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
if Democrats can't make an exact session
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
you need to talk to Janet
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
um and and we'll work out something
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
um we've got a
 
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
we've got a small enough group we've got
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
to completely balanced committee we have
 
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
to do we have to make sure we have to
 
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
work together here to make sure
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
everybody has the opportunity to have
 
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
their votes
 
00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:27.799 align:start position:0%
um here so there's not going to be
 
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
that gets to a good point as far in
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
years past we've been able to when we
 
00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:36.059 align:start position:0%
had a break in a in a hearing so that
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
there was available time
 
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
we've been able to look at each other
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
and say you want to try to exec a couple
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
of bills while we have time here
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
we can still do that if we both agree
 
00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
but in years past I could just decide as
 
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
chair we're going into exec session and
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to handle the bill and it
 
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.200 align:start position:0%

00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%

work
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%

what's business casual a little bit more
 
00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:00.779 align:start position:0%

um if you have a hearing in a different
committee

committee

while on the day that we're having
 
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.110 align:start position:0%
while on the day that we're having
hearings

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
um please let me know or Vanessa that
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
you'll be leaving and how long you'll be
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
leaving for
 
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.450 align:start position:0%
leaving for
um

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
the courtesy for that is to leave
 
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.090 align:start position:0%
the courtesy for that is to leave
between

00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
people testifying so you don't just um
 
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh get up and walk out while somebody's
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
at the testimony table
 
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
um I would prefer you wait until they
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
finish and then you get up and leave
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
likewise when you come back same thing
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
you wait until there's a break in in the
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
testimony and then you come and sit down
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
um people walking back and forth is uh
 
00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:27.590 align:start position:0%
um people walking back and forth is uh
considered

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.169 align:start position:0%
considered
inappropriate

00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
what's that distract distracting as well
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
um public notice of all meetings will be
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
done through the calendar everybody is
 
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
familiar with how you can see and you
 
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
also get an individual email when you
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
have when you are
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
um having a hearings or something set up
 
00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:51.539 align:start position:0%
on here so everyone should have no
 
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
excuse for not knowing when we're
 
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.029 align:start position:0%
excuse for not knowing when we're
meeting

00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:27:59.210 --> 00:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
caucuses are called uh
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
um actually Vanessa calls all caucuses
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
for the Republican side I'm assuming you
 
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
are calling all Janet's calling all
 
00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539 align:start position:0%
caucuses on the other side
 
00:28:09.539 --> 00:28:10.669 align:start position:0%
caucuses on the other side
um

00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
there's a section here on lobbyists
 
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
we don't tend to have lobbyists in this
 
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.269 align:start position:0%
we don't tend to have lobbyists in this
committee

00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.769 align:start position:0%
committee
um

00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
we have generally three Usual Suspects
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
that come to our hearings one is the um
 
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
is our clerk Paul Smith the other is the
 
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
house attorney uh Jim ciancy and the
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
third is the Chief Operating Officer
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
Terry paff those are generally the
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
people that are here
 
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.769 align:start position:0%
people that are here
um

00:28:44.769 --> 00:28:44.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
I Wilt they they submit pink cards to
 
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
testify as well
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
um everything about them is is the same
 
00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
as if um the public was here we
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
generally don't have many members of the
 
00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:00.299 align:start position:0%
public here
 
00:29:00.299 --> 00:29:01.190 align:start position:0%
public here
um

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
because this is kind of internal
 
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
operations you know this is how we
 
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
operate the legislature more than
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
anything and and the public
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't really care how we do it they
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
care what we do but they don't care how
 
00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
we do it so um we tend not to uh to see
 
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
raucous crowds so Steve might be asleep
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
most of the time down the back there
 
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.149 align:start position:0%
most of the time down the back there
um

00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
what else have I got here we'll have uh
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
publicized our executive sessions
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
um because this is going to be a little
 
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
odd for this year even for people that
 
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
have been here well as long as I have
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
maybe not as long as Janet has been here
 
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
um because we are
 
00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.710 align:start position:0%
um because we are
split

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
split
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
first of all let me step up this is
 
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
this tends not to be a controversial
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
committee this tends not to be a
 
00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
partisan committee
 
00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.510 align:start position:0%
partisan committee
um

00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.470 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna do my best to not know who
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
where anybody is
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
um on which which team
 
00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:08.510 align:start position:0%
um on which which team
um

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
but it is
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
um it is typically Alvin
 
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
we're kind of in a committee orientation
 
00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:18.059 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:18.059 --> 00:30:19.130 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
didn't really matter if he was here but
 
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.450 align:start position:0%
that's fine
um

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
so um this tends not to be that way but
 
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
it is possible that we will come out
 
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.049 align:start position:0%
it is possible that we will come out
with

00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:30.830 align:start position:0%
with
um

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
a split vote we have 16 people we may
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
come out with eight to eight so we're
 
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
gonna have to go through the process of
 
00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:43.580 align:start position:0%
making a motion of either octopasser or
 
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate
 
00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
go through the votes and it may come out
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
that we're deadlocked in that case the
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
bill will go to the floor with no
 
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
recommendation and there will be the
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity for both sides to have
 
00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:00.889 align:start position:0%
opportunity for both sides to have
um

00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
committee reports in there they won't be
 
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
minority and majority it'll just say
 
00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:09.779 align:start position:0%
committee reports and here's the two
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
sides to the argument
 
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.710 align:start position:0%
sides to the argument
um

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
I don't really think we're gonna get
 
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
that but that's that's the process
 
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.010 align:start position:0%
that but that's that's the process
anyway

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
um so um we'll be uh we'll be working
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
all of that out as we go and there'll be
 
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
more to come on that when we get to
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
exact session I think
 
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.529 align:start position:0%
exact session I think
um

00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:30.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
what else do we need here committee all
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
committee reports are due on the day
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
that we exec
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't get back in your car
 
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
before the committee report is here I
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
have to look over every committee report
 
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:49.940 align:start position:0%
and then it goes through our assistant
 
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
before it gets into the calendar
 
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
so um here's what we're doing on on our
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
side and I can tell you what you want to
 
00:31:58.679 --> 00:31:59.450 align:start position:0%
side and I can tell you what you want to
do

00:31:59.450 --> 00:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
um we're hopeful that
 
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
we can caucus two days before the
 
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
um the exact session and we will know
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be doing and we're
 
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
going to be knowing who on on our side
 
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.990 align:start position:0%
going to be knowing who on on our side
or

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
I keep saying our side as if it's going
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
to be partisan but it isn't always
 
00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
um so we're gonna know what that
 
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
committee report will say generally when
 
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
we come in for exact session so that you
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity to actually
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
write the committee report before you
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
get here
 
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
um from one side or the other doesn't
 
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
mean it's always going to work out or
 
00:32:42.289 --> 00:32:42.299 align:start position:0%
there won't be new information when we
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
actually do a a discussion on Executive
 
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
session but yep Allison oh I was just
 
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
going to say that I'm a lot of the time
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
we're having repeat bills and on the
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
research they have the old
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
um committee report and I am one for
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
just stealing the old one or um
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
you notice adding new information to it
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
and that's totally an option that's
 
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.350 align:start position:0%
and that's totally an option that's
plagiarism

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
plagiarism
 
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.730 align:start position:0%
plagiarism
um

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
I sent out I hope everybody has received
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
from our researcher
 
00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:14.990 align:start position:0%
from our researcher
um

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
history on the bills that we've that we
 
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
plan on hearing Alan good morning sit
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
wherever you like Alan
 
00:33:27.169 --> 00:33:27.179 align:start position:0%
nope wherever you want yep except my
 
00:33:27.179 --> 00:33:28.850 align:start position:0%
nope wherever you want yep except my
seat

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
seat
 
00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.350 align:start position:0%
seat
um

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
and in here you'll see
 
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not sure how confusing this
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
was to everybody but the these are the
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
bills that we've heard in the past that
 
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
are very similar to the bills we're
 
00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.169 align:start position:0%
are very similar to the bills we're
hearing

00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
um so you will see the committee reports
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
on either the pro side or the and and I
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
think all of these may have been consent
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
calendar that we were doing
 
00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.289 align:start position:0%
calendar that we were doing
um

00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
but at any rate
 
00:33:58.860 --> 00:33:59.690 align:start position:0%
but at any rate
um

00:33:59.690 --> 00:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
you're getting a sample of what it
 
00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
should look like
 
00:34:03.779 --> 00:34:04.669 align:start position:0%
should look like
um

00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
so that's always helpful I'm going to
 
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
try to do that with our researcher on
 
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
all of our bills there's only one that I
 
00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:14.339 align:start position:0%
can think of off the top of my head that
 
00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:16.619 align:start position:0%
we won't be able to do that our
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
committee researcher usually sits down
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
there next to where our clerk is and on
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
that separate table on the side Jennifer
 
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:25.849 align:start position:0%
that separate table on the side Jennifer
for

00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
we've been blessed in this committee
 
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
we've had two researchers Pam smarling
 
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
who left and I thought we would never be
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
able to replace Pam smarling
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
um but Jennifer for
 
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:41.099 align:start position:0%
um I can say without her here and so you
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
know I'm not trying to suck up to her
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
she's brilliant
 
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.730 align:start position:0%
she's brilliant
um

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:45.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
talk to her sometime about her
 
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
background but she is brilliant and she
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
almost anticipates what I'm asking
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
before I ask it so that helps me
 
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.869 align:start position:0%
before I ask it so that helps me
tremendously

00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
tremendously
 
00:34:56.879 --> 00:34:58.370 align:start position:0%
tremendously
um

00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
I have the connection to Jennifer
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
um individually you do not have access
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
to Jennifer so all questions or all
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
research that you would like to be done
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
needs to come through the chair
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
um so and I'm not going to say
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
I'm probably not going to say no unless
 
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
I feel like I'm wasting her time or
 
00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:25.619 align:start position:0%
we've already done it before so
 
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
um that's
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
um that will be Jennifer you'll be
 
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
introduced to her I'm sure when we start
 
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
in with hearings
 
00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.910 align:start position:0%
in with hearings
um

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
what else should I get
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
I think you've pretty much hit all bases
 
00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
and as we move along there'll be more
 
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
instruction so no one will feel left out
 
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
I don't think
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
um I do believe this information we've
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
received from committee research it's
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
very very helpful just to give us some
 
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
background I'm not sure it covers
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
everything on every bill but it gives a
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
good sense of where we've been and where
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
we should be going perhaps times do
 
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
change maybe some might change I don't
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
see that in any of these oftentimes our
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
bills come out unanimously from this
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee we try to put partisan
 
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
politics totally aside think of what's
 
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
best for the State of New Hampshire and
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
for the operations of the house and it
 
00:36:20.089 --> 00:36:20.099 align:start position:0%
works out we do have an excellent
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
chairman it's very fair he's firm but
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
fair and most of the time and um I I
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
think you'll enjoy being on this
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
committee it's not a large committee
 
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
we'll get to know each other and if you
 
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
have questions or concerns come to any
 
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
one of us and we'll get to know
 
00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:37.430 align:start position:0%
one of us and we'll get to know
everybody

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
um it'll be almost like a family
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
atmosphere and yes families do have
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
disputes occasionally but um what we
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
will do is talk things out in here and
 
00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
hopefully when it comes time to exec on
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
our bills we'll come out with a lot of
 
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
unanimous votes keeping our fingers
 
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.030 align:start position:0%
unanimous votes keeping our fingers
crossed

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
crossed
 
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I'm not sure we've ever
 
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
had anyone on this committee go up on
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house do you remember
 
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
anything like that to dispute what we've
 
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.150 align:start position:0%
anything like that to dispute what we've
done

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
I don't have a record he probably has
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
but I don't uh I don't off the top of my
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
head yeah um but um again we've gotten
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
great instructions today everything's so
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
highly organized which is wonderful this
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
term and uh I think things will run very
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
smoothly and come to any one of us with
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
any questions or concerns uh because we
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
were there once it doesn't mean we know
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
the answer to it but right but we know
 
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
where to go to get the answer I think
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
more than anything
 
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.290 align:start position:0%
more than anything
um

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:32.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
this is the prestigious committee
 
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
um it's actually our clerk favorite
 
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.790 align:start position:0%
um it's actually our clerk favorite
committee

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
um but it is um
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
it used to be years past you can talk to
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
some of the long-term staff people and
 
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
it used to be difficult to get here it
 
00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:57.260 align:start position:0%
used to be that only the
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
long-term veterans kind of like Ethics
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
Committee right
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
um it used to be that you you never saw
 
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
a freshman here
 
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:07.910 align:start position:0%
a freshman here
um

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
for some unknown reason for the last
 
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
couple of terms it's not been that way
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
and and I don't know why um other than I
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
don't know why I don't even have a
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion but um it is um
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
we do operate differently we're we're
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
we if you listen to the people that
 
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
you'll meet in other committees we don't
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
operate like they do
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
um so I I think you're lucky you're here
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
and that's how I tend to operate
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
speaking of
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
our very fine
 
00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:47.540 align:start position:0%
house researcher
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
hi Jennifer
 
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
um Jennifer is responsible for our work
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
that we have in front of us of the uh of
 
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
the bills that um on the on the
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
these are just the bills that we are
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
hearing today
 
00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.930 align:start position:0%
hearing today
I think

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.970 align:start position:0%
I think
um

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
this is indicative of the kind of work
 
00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
that Jennifer does
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we have any questions
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
for Jennifer and if anybody does
 
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.069 align:start position:0%
for Jennifer and if anybody does
um

00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
Jennifer usually sits right there and
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
listens to all the things that I do
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
wrong and then shakes her head and and
 
00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
um yeah see just like that and uh and uh
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
so it it should go
 
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
fairly smoothly
 
00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
um this is a lot of times our audience
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
um this is a lot of times uh how we're
 
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
gonna how we're gonna operate
 
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
um we also have kind of an odd situation
 
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
because through that door is our
 
00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099 align:start position:0%
committee assistant Heather goalie
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
Heather retires tomorrow
 
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
um so I how many years do you know I
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
don't know long time
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
since I've been here
 
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.270 align:start position:0%
since I've been here
um

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
but uh we have uh Jamie is that right
 
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
Jamie is coming
 
00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
um I've only met her briefly not to
 
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
release me but she will be taking over
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
for our committee and she will be in
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
that room right okay
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
um so we'll find out from uh when we can
 
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
meet Jamie I don't think it'll be today
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
I don't even she's I think she's still
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
in training or
 
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.750 align:start position:0%
something like that
um

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:35.099 align:start position:0%
no no
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
um letter let her keep doing what she's
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
doing it's not that important
 
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
um everything really Deb Hobson and I
 
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
will have the most contact with um with
 
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.569 align:start position:0%
will have the most contact with um with
Heather

00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:47.579 align:start position:0%
Heather
 
00:40:47.579 --> 00:40:48.410 align:start position:0%
Heather
um

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:51.500 align:start position:0%
she does all of the con
 
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
compilation of the work we do and make
 
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
sure it gets into the right form and
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
make sure it gets into the calendar and
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
make sure it goes to the floor correctly
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
and all of that pizza
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
um there's really nothing
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
I can't think of anything that that
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
individual members will have
 
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
um except for a question or two
 
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:14.690 align:start position:0%
um except for a question or two
um

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
Heather is usually pretty good at
 
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
stopping members asking things that they
 
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
don't she doesn't have to do for members
 
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I said that clearly
 
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.190 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I said that clearly
enough

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:33.980 align:start position:0%
but they are not here to do our work
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
they aren't here to go make copies for
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
us they aren't here to uh I don't know
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
whatever else you want to think of
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
they they have their own internal work
 
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
for the committee and I think Heather
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
does how many commissions did she do
 
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
yeah so so we're small fish
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
um in a big pond and and our committee
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
has the maybe the fewest amount of
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
problems for her but um but that's
 
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
um Gonna Change
 
00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:12.470 align:start position:0%
um Gonna Change
um

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
Personnel we won't have Heather to to
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
kick around anymore we have uh Jamie
 
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
um what else do you need anything yep
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
well the only thing I wanted to say is
 
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
that this must be like orientation for a
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
lot of you just overwhelming it's very
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
smooth the way the committee operates
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
and you'll find that you can relax you
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
can learn a lot you can learn a lot
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
about each other and it really will be a
 
00:42:43.609 --> 00:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
fulfilling responsibility being on this
 
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
committee thank you
 
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.450 align:start position:0%
committee thank you
okay

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:46.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
speaking of Heather and meeting
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
scheduling and things like that I just
 
00:42:53.329 --> 00:42:53.339 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask a clarifying question on
 
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
the last scheduling email that came out
 
00:42:59.210 --> 00:42:59.220 align:start position:0%
because it's a 9 A.M hearing and then
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
nothing and then a 1pm hearing on that
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
same day our is I just wanted to see if
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
that was correct because it was odd yeah
 
00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.270 align:start position:0%
that was correct because it was odd yeah
um

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
so it's a little bit of a work in
 
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
progress but here's what I am hoping to
 
00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.750 align:start position:0%
progress but here's what I am hoping to
do

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.470 align:start position:0%
do
um

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
we have four today right four bills
 
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.630 align:start position:0%
we have four today right four bills
today

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
um that leaves us with three after that
 
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
so what I had scheduled one of the the
 
00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
last bill that we're hearing today I
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
think is going to need a work session
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
for all of us
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
um a whole a committee of the whole work
 
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
session so my anticipation is that that
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
is the nine o'clock that you're talking
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
about will do that work session for the
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
rest of that morning
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
and then we'll hear
 
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:53.630 align:start position:0%
and then we'll hear
um

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
yeah then we'll hear the other three
 
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
what kind of screws that up a little bit
 
00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.550 align:start position:0%
what kind of screws that up a little bit
is

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:02.349 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:05.220 align:start position:0%
so our ranking member is also a member
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the Ethics Committee
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
who is meeting on the 13th at three
 
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.630 align:start position:0%
who is meeting on the 13th at three
o'clock

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.490 align:start position:0%
o'clock
so

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
we kind of want to hear what Ethics
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
Committee thinks or has for suggestions
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
on that ethics bill that we're hearing
 
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
today so I suspect what we're going to
 
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
do is is have our work session
 
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
maybe come up with an amendment or two
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
but then we're going to have to sit on
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
that until we find out what ethics does
 
00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
on the 13th and then we'll meet after
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
that to uh to either exec or amend that
 
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.730 align:start position:0%
that to uh to either exec or amend that
bill

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
um so that's why it's a little bit
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
spread out
 
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
um if that answers your question it does
 
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yep
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and there won't be
 
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
time to kill so to speak if we're not
 
00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
doing something feel free to go into any
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
other committee you want to go to to
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
learn how they're operating and what the
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
subject matter is because that's very
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
helpful in your years here because I
 
00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
suspect people will want to keep coming
 
00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.390 align:start position:0%
suspect people will want to keep coming
back

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.050 align:start position:0%
back
um

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
we will have times when we will have a
 
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
break and if you're not testifying in
 
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
another committee but you do see a bill
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's interesting by all means skip out
 
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
and do that just let the chairman know
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
where you are thank you yep
 
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
um yep Mr chairman I'd like to add two
 
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:33.950 align:start position:0%
um yep Mr chairman I'd like to add two
other

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:45:35.809 --> 00:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
things to
 
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
the function of committee the first one
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
involves your cell phone
 
00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
really really be sure not to have that
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
thing ringing during your public
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
hearings it's uh
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
these have been out long enough now we
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
should we should know how to put them on
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
mute or uh vibrate the other thing
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
involves this thing microphone etiquette
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
right so there is a limit to the system
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
as to how many microphones it can be on
 
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
just that simple because if we have too
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
many going you'll see you will typically
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
see one blinking and that means there's
 
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
too many mics on and that can just
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
between the background noise and the
 
00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
confusion that can actually shut off the
 
00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
Public's microphone so just try to just
 
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
try to remember to shut your mic off
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
that's all and the public doesn't need
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
to hear you say this is stupid why are
 
00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
we here so
 
00:46:26.819 --> 00:46:28.430 align:start position:0%
we here so
um

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
the other thing that occurred to me
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
while you were talking to is our office
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
is is in that behind that wall over
 
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.250 align:start position:0%
is is in that behind that wall over
there

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:41.099 align:start position:0%
um in there are drawers for everyone uh
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
keyed drawers so you can lock them up if
 
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
you want
 
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.089 align:start position:0%
you want
um

00:46:47.089 --> 00:46:47.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
I've never had a purpose for them I've
 
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
never used one but some people do you
 
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
can put your lunch in there don't forget
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
that you put your lunch in there but it
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
is it typically is um just the place to
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
uh to I don't know leave some of your
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
work or or some of the bills or
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
something you don't need at home

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%

01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
and welcoming the prime sponsor
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
welcome to legislative Administration
 
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.990 align:start position:0%
welcome to legislative Administration
representative

01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr it's great to be here I was
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
here one other time and I survived
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
so thank you for uh
 
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
for scheduling this this morning so this
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
proposed measure cacr3 seeks to enable
 
01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature to create
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
a recall procedure permitting citizens
 
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
and legislators to remove an elected
 
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
official before the end of a term of
 
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:12.049 align:start position:0%
official before the end of a term of
office

01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:12.059 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
so I I was here before with this
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
um as Calvin Coolidge said
 
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
persistence is omnipotent and I I've had
 
01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
a number of measures that took more than
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
one term to become law I could name
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
several as some of you may know some so
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
sometimes it takes more than one uh bite
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
at the Apple to get a good measure
 
01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
forward and I obviously believe in this
 
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
it's a non-partisan bipartisan measure a
 
01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
couple times ago it had all uh Democrat
 
01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.450 align:start position:0%
couple times ago it had all uh Democrat
sponsors

01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
sponsors
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
and then last time around it had some
 
01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
Republican spots so it's not partisan
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's not uh it's bipartisan
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
so yes this is similar proposal to win
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
submit in the past now as told before
 
01:04:57.650 --> 01:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
that a reason that this type of measure
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
has had not moved forward is because we
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
have two-year terms in New Hampshire
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
and if you have two-year terms then it's
 
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
not that crucial you know you it's not
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
that long of a period of time you have a
 
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
bad felonious corrupt whatever elected
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
official you know just a few more months
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
and you can vote them out
 
01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
so believe it or not I know that I knew
 
01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.170 align:start position:0%
so believe it or not I know that I knew
that

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
um in fact I'm the one of the sponsors
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
of the Civic spills so so yes I I know
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
about the two-year terms
 
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.470 align:start position:0%
um but
the

01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
intent of this really is not directed to
 
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
the two-year positions uh it's it's
 
01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:40.670 align:start position:0%
the two-year positions uh it's it's
directed

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
directed
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
at three year positions typically it's
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
not directed particularly at us
 
01:05:50.109 --> 01:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
it's directed to boards local boards
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities school boards uh
 
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
selectment boards on and on and on
 
01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:56.930 align:start position:0%
selectment boards on and on and on
um

01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:00.049 --> 01:06:00.059 align:start position:0%
for example if if wanted to
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
individuals were elected to a three-year
 
01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
term on some board whatever the board
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
may be and they and one of them were
 
01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
both of them turned out to be corrupt
 
01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
felonious they don't show up uh they
 
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
hinder that they're they're bad
 
01:06:16.609 --> 01:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
officials well right now that
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
municipality is stuck with these elected
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
officials for for three years
 
01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
and that's a problem that's why this has
 
01:06:26.329 --> 01:06:26.339 align:start position:0%
come up before
 
01:06:26.339 --> 01:06:27.430 align:start position:0%
come up before
um

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
introduced by others and then also Now
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
by myself
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
so the municipalities would be trapped
 
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
and such situations have occurred and
 
01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
will occur again no doubt and some of us
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
think the legislature owes it to
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
communities to provide a mechanism for
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
Relief that would allow districts some
 
01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.309 align:start position:0%
Relief that would allow districts some
hope

01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
hope
 
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
uh for relief from these scenarios where
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
they have uh elected officials who just
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
don't belong on the board and the people
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
want to get rid of them and they can't
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're stuck
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
so the the need for this is even greater
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
now than it was
 
01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
a last year as a year ago that was of
 
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
the time I was here because now we have
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
four-year terms if you recall in the
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
last session one of the counties we we
 
01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
passed legislation allowing County to
 
01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
have four-year positions
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
Belknap county is looking to uh now to
 
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
also have four-year positions and so
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
that further increases the the urgency
 
01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
of of giving voters a mechanism if they
 
01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:35.900 align:start position:0%
ever need
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
to rethink somebody who's in office
 
01:07:42.049 --> 01:07:42.059 align:start position:0%
who's just doesn't belong there
 
01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
and and but they're they're stuck
 
01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
before you know for three years or four
 
01:07:51.289 --> 01:07:51.299 align:start position:0%
years or whatever unless we give them an
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity or unless we give the
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
legislature unless we give ourselves an
 
01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:57.410 align:start position:0%
legislature unless we give ourselves an
opportunity

01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
um to develop a recall procedure so I'll
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
have to take questions in a moment but I
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
want to ask you all a question a
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question why would we not
 
01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:11.339 align:start position:0%
take action on this and and thus condemn
 
01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure will happens happen
 
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
before and will unfortunately happen
 
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
again where we have some elected
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
officials who don't belong in office why
 
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
would we condemn municipalities or
 
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
counties now to have people in office
 
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
for three or four years running a mock
 
01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:31.140 align:start position:0%
not serving the people
 
01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.269 align:start position:0%
not serving the people
um

01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:34.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
a possible
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
issue that's come up when I brought this
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
up before I'll paraphrase a question I
 
01:08:41.219 --> 01:08:42.169 align:start position:0%
up before I'll paraphrase a question I
got

01:08:42.169 --> 01:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:08:43.849 --> 01:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
what makes you think a bunch of
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
politicians would ever consider a
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
proposal where politicians could get
 
01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.789 align:start position:0%
proposal where politicians could get
recalled

01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
recalled
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
now I don't consider us to be
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
politicians at all we're citizen
 
01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.030 align:start position:0%
politicians at all we're citizen
legislators

01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
that's what I told the person who's who
 
01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
and I don't like being called politician
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think any of us are politicians
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
in in the pejorative sense of the word
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know we're citizen legislators with
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
with the highest Integrity citizen
 
01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:12.500 align:start position:0%
legislators working for 100 bucks a year
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
this body unlike other bodies across the
 
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
country I can see what they would be
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
worried about recall elections because
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be recalled
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
so in other states uh California has
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
recall elections famously so
 
01:09:33.289 --> 01:09:33.299 align:start position:0%
Schwarzenegger became Governor they had
 
01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
a recall election there a year or two
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
ago for governor
 
01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:39.299 align:start position:0%
but in these other states the recall
 
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
procedures are put into place via
 
01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.010 align:start position:0%
procedures are put into place via
referendum

01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
referendum
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
so here
 
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
there's certainly sentiment to have a
 
01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:49.259 align:start position:0%
recall procedure in place but we can't
 
01:09:52.249 --> 01:09:52.259 align:start position:0%
do it in the legislature because it's a
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's a constitutional issue so all this
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
cacr does I'm sure you have it in front
 
01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
of it it changes a line in the in the
 
01:10:04.090 --> 01:10:04.100 align:start position:0%
Constitution that would enable the
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
legislature to Simply take up and
 
01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.030 align:start position:0%
legislature to Simply take up and
discuss

01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
a proposal for a recall procedure or
 
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
mechanism so this is not that this is
 
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
not a specific proposal for
 
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
some mechanism to
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
put it into place recall elections this
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
just enables you it enables us in the
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
future to take this up and at least have
 
01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:33.739 align:start position:0%
a bill as opposed to a resolution
 
01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
uh to put into place some sort of a
 
01:10:36.659 --> 01:10:37.790 align:start position:0%
uh to put into place some sort of a
recall

01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
recall
 
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
procedure the the nature of that the
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
wording of it I don't know but I know
 
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
folks would come up and there are plenty
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
of models out there of we call
 
01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.750 align:start position:0%
of models out there of we call
um

01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
policies or or bills
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
so anyway I think it would be uh the
 
01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
right thing to do I think would be
 
01:10:58.850 --> 01:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
inspiring I think people would like that
 
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
here's this legislature that put in a
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism to be recalled not by
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
referendum but that we put in
 
01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
so anyway uh I hope that you'll give
 
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
this uh due consideration
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for time and I'd be happy
 
01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
to take any questions if there are any
 
01:11:18.169 --> 01:11:18.179 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Moffett are
 
01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:19.380 align:start position:0%

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.950 align:start position:0%
there any questions for the
representative

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
yes representative payer all right good
 
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:25.490 align:start position:0%
yes representative payer all right good
morning

01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
um can you just clarify which Counties
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
have a four-year term or a three-year
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
term now right uh was it Carroll County
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
um or
 
01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
Rockingham I'm trying to think uh
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
okay Rockingham was the one that I
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
referred to that we took up in the
 
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.810 align:start position:0%
referred to that we took up in the
legislature

01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
um Rockingham now apparently is in
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
position to have four-year terms and I
 
01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
know belnap has taken up this similar
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
thing right now
 
01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question excellent
 
01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:07.310 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question excellent
question

01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
which county positions are going from
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
three to four years in Rockingham off
 
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
top of my head I can't
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
remember and that's kind of up to the
 
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.970 align:start position:0%
remember and that's kind of up to the
counties

01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
um it could I'm not sure if it's County
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners but uh we as a legislature
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
had to bless if you will the counties uh
 
01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
going from three to four year terms
 
01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
and I guess it'll be up to the counties
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
or again
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
looking ahead if if this did move
 
01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.229 align:start position:0%
looking ahead if if this did move
forward

01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
if some sort of process or mechanism was
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
structured I don't know what that would
 
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
be but locally I mean which I'm not the
 
01:12:44.689 --> 01:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
county to your question but locally if a
 
01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:46.460 align:start position:0%
municipal I've been on a school board
 
01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
and I've seen uh in some of you have
 
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
seen select Boards of school boards that
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
have Rogue members I can think of some
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
examples of people who
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
of elected officials on the local level
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
who needed to be booted so the process I
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
as I said earlier I don't know what that
 
01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
would be but um there would be something
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
that the counties or the municipalities
 
01:13:15.169 --> 01:13:15.179 align:start position:0%
would would put in place uh if down the
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
road if we get this one line change in
 
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
the Constitution then a mechanism could
 
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
be discussed and hopefully put into
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
place because we want to there are
 
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
people who need to be booted out or they
 
01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
have been and probably will be
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Richard
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:36.770 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
um so you've talked about the localities
 
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
um and were you approached by a number
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
of school boards uh range 5 10 asking
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
for this bill and or the school boards
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
Association as well as additional
 
01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities if you could further kind
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
of elaborate on that as you sponsored
 
01:13:59.570 --> 01:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
the bill sure thank you very very good
 
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned school boards
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
Association and having been an education
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
committee and you're seeing those folks
 
01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
come in and talk on on measures
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't know
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm very it's a great question
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
because I wonder what the school boards
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
Association they take positions on
 
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
measures uh would they be interested in
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
this or against it
 
01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
um no and to your to your question this
 
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
came about because of discussions I just
 
01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
had informally with with all kinds of
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
folks including um as I said this came
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
in a couple terms ago that was sponsored
 
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
by several Democrats and and I spoke
 
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
with some of them
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
and as I said one of the things that
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
they wore me about was that you're going
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
to hear we don't need it because we have
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
two-year terms and as I said it's uh
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
this is really not aimed at two-year
 
01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
terms particularly it's three and four
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question somewhat
 
01:14:54.169 --> 01:14:54.179 align:start position:0%
follow up um where so I think my
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
specific question was were you talked
 
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
informally so was it there any school
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
boards or Municipal elected officials
 
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
that approached you for this yeah thanks
 
01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
for your question uh the schools
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
Association per se did not is not
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
involved with this
 
01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:16.970 align:start position:0%
involved with this
um

01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
I spoke have spoken with a number of
 
01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:21.900 align:start position:0%
Municipal officials uh Schoolboy members
 
01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
past and present and
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
citizens of communities who we discuss
 
01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:33.860 align:start position:0%
the problem of Rogue board members so
 
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
informal discussions nothing uh from an
 
01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
further questions representative turcott
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
yes I just kind of wonder if if it
 
01:15:50.689 --> 01:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
happens to be uh a recall procedure to
 
01:15:52.729 --> 01:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
permit the citizens to vote is it like
 
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
you have to have a special Town warrant
 
01:15:58.729 --> 01:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
or or a voting yeah thank you for the
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
question uh another great question and
 
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
uh as I said earlier that's such an
 
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
interesting question because it gets us
 
01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
thinking about uh the process or the
 
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
procedures or how this would go about
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
and that's the the beauty of this uh is
 
01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:18.380 align:start position:0%
that I'm not here today to talk about
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
specific mechanisms that may or may not
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
be put into place uh
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
I'm here today just to get one line
 
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
changed in the Constitution so so that
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
your question as to how this might be
 
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
applied or developed that's something to
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
be determined if this moves forward down
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
the road in the legislature and I think
 
01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:41.060 align:start position:0%
it would be very interesting
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
if if the legislature was enabled and
 
01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:46.460 align:start position:0%
could could put something like this in
 
01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh it'd be very interesting to see the
 
01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:50.510 align:start position:0%
uh it'd be very interesting to see the
different

01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
perspectives and approaches that might
 
01:16:55.490 --> 01:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
be used so this is not specific to that
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
but that's a great question and I hope
 
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
that your question can be answered in
 
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
the legislature in the future if this
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
moves forward and and there can be a
 
01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.610 align:start position:0%
moves forward and and there can be a
bill

01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
the specific bill that would come to
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
some committee about a procedure or a
 
01:17:17.229 --> 01:17:17.239 align:start position:0%
mechanism for localities and counties to
 
01:17:20.689 --> 01:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
recall people and there's also you know
 
01:17:20.699 --> 01:17:21.970 align:start position:0%
recall people and there's also you know
that

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:21.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
two-year positions still are out there
 
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
and on the state level so anyway getting
 
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
down in the weeds a little bit but that
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
that debated discussion I hope gets to
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
happen is that kind of answer your
 
01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.430 align:start position:0%
happen is that kind of answer your
question

01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson
 
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett we we've heard a
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
um you know this as a as a general
 
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
overall topic not specifically to
 
01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:54.290 align:start position:0%
overall topic not specifically to
criteria

01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
as this seems to affect multiple levels
 
01:18:00.010 --> 01:18:00.020 align:start position:0%
of government
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
who will create the criteria for this is
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
this the legislature's job to create the
 
01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
criteria is it
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
as an executive board member of
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County does the county then
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
have to do theirs does the town of my
 
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
town of Derry have to do theirs or is
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
this something that the legislature
 
01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:18.659 align:start position:0%
handles uniformly across the state sure
 
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question sure this would
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
be sent to your question this would be
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature would put
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
into place or not uh if this one line
 
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
get changed I would
 
01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:33.659 align:start position:0%
anticipate a number of different types
 
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
of proposals coming to the through the
 
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
LEDs to the legislature through the
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
legislature to create that mechanism of
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
that process and and what that would be
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
I I don't know but uh again I think it
 
01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
would be very interesting to have the
 
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have that discussion and
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
have bills submitted and and maybe you
 
01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
have some specific ideas as to how to
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
shape that
 
01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
that's not what this is about but what
 
01:19:01.689 --> 01:19:01.699 align:start position:0%
this is about is to give you all us
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
legislators the opening to at least have
 
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
the discussion the conversation via a
 
01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:08.390 align:start position:0%
the discussion the conversation via a
bill

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
can I follow up on that follow up thank
 
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:12.770 align:start position:0%
you sir
so

01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:16.689 --> 01:19:16.699 align:start position:0%
the enabling legislation here enables
 
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature or does it
 
01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:20.810 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature or does it
enable

01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
enable
 
01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
all forms of government county level and
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
Municipal level sure who does this
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
enable thank you it would enable the
 
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
legislature initially to enable us to
 
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
have a bill a discussion a debate and
 
01:19:36.169 --> 01:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
and vote on on some proposal the details
 
01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
to be determined by the legislature you
 
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
know once that happened if or hopefully
 
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
when that someday happens then the
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
implementation of that locally if the
 
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
legislature if if you pass this one-line
 
01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
thing and then if a bill in the future
 
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
uh becomes law then the counties the
 
01:19:57.970 --> 01:19:57.980 align:start position:0%
municipalities or the cities
 
01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
if they have a if there are some
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
citizens who want to have a recall then
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
they have that mechanism in place the
 
01:20:15.169 --> 01:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:16.510 align:start position:0%
representative Tierney
 
01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:18.169 align:start position:0%
representative Tierney
[Music]

01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:20:20.209 --> 01:20:20.219 align:start position:0%
this one line you're saying would give
 
01:20:23.810 --> 01:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
the legislature the authority to make
 
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
the change later on
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
but nowhere's in there does it say three
 
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.290 align:start position:0%
but nowhere's in there does it say three
years

01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
or longer term
 
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
so would the legislature be able to
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
override what this one line says and put
 
01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
limits on it
 
01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:45.980 align:start position:0%
uh sure the legislature you know Bill
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
submitted by a legislator or legislative
 
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
tourist would go to OLS and and the the
 
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
legal people would work on the wording
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
and again the the line says
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh to provide a recall procedure to
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
permit citizens to remove an elected
 
01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
official before the end of the term of
 
01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:06.590 align:start position:0%
official before the end of the term of
office

01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
so uh two years three years four years
 
01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
communities municipalities cities all
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
those details uh those would be in
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
proposed statute which which is not what
 
01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:21.659 align:start position:0%
this is about this is just giving us the
 
01:21:23.930 --> 01:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity to consider a proposed
 
01:21:30.169 --> 01:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
um currently if there's someone in a
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
position of authority an elected
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
official and something goes wrong
 
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
um usually it hits the newspapers and
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
the communities get very upset and all
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
and on the rare occasion where we read
 
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
about these types of instances the
 
01:21:58.370 --> 01:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
person usually resigns
 
01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
do you see having an amendment to the
 
01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
Constitution making a situation like
 
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
that any less contentious or meant any
 
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
more efficient or effective than what we
 
01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
have now
 
01:22:12.610 --> 01:22:12.620 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question uh yes
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
when there's a bad actor so to speak
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm sure we can all think of
 
01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
examples of such bad actors who betrayed
 
01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
the trust of the citizens who elected
 
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
them and did malfeasance and and got
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
into the newspapers
 
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
um yeah some of them uh are shamed
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
if you will into resigning and that's
 
01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:39.860 align:start position:0%
has happened and that's the the best way
 
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
uh representative Wilds great question
 
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
that the best way is to have these
 
01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:46.739 align:start position:0%
people resign
 
01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:50.219 align:start position:0%
but there are times where they will not
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
um not that many hopefully very few but
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's what this is all about is for
 
01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
those instances where you have someone
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
who uh is corrupt felonious or doesn't
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
show up or you name it and they won't
 
01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.530 align:start position:0%
show up or you name it and they won't
resign

01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
resign
 
01:23:09.290 --> 01:23:09.300 align:start position:0%
um there are examples of elected
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
officials being in jail
 
01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
um around the country and in some cases
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
without a mechanism to uh
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
in some of these elected offenses I can
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
think of I hate to say Massachusetts and
 
01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
Louisiana but there are people who've
 
01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
been in jail
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
who would not resign to your point
 
01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:35.219 align:start position:0%
um they not only uh were in the media as
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the newspapers and were
 
01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
shamed and we're asked to resign and
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
they were imprisoned and they would not
 
01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
resign and this disenfranchises their
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
people when you have not that this
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
happens here much but it has happened
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
could happen and so
 
01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.030 align:start position:0%
could happen and so
um yes

01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
you would hope that someone would resign
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
and most do but some won't and this
 
01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:07.729 --> 01:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
I have one
 
01:24:07.739 --> 01:24:08.510 align:start position:0%
I have one
um

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm seeing the uh the wording for
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
you you set on uh on page two the
 
01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
wording uh being put to the qualified
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
voters shall be
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
and it goes from line 7 to line 33.
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
and it includes things even talking
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
about the rates and taxes on growing
 
01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
wood and Timber
 
01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:40.189 align:start position:0%
wood and Timber
um

01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
is it your belief that uh 60 percent of
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
the voting public would
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
read that paragraph
 
01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
um and and pull from it the idea of
 
01:24:57.130 --> 01:24:57.140 align:start position:0%
having a recall position for to permit
 
01:24:59.810 --> 01:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
citizens to remove an elected official
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
before the end of term of office
 
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
and load affirmatively yeah thank you
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
for the question and the jargon or the
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
verbiage you refer to is what's already
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh in uh law
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
and that's another good question and I
 
01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
would hope that folks who do read
 
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
through this would would think the way
 
01:25:22.729 --> 01:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
that you're thinking about how this
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
might be applied
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
um could it be applied in a punitive
 
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
fashion uh if somebody just doesn't like
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
someone who doesn't necessarily broken
 
01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
the law or you know they just want to
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
get rid of well that's democracy and I
 
01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
think it would be a whatever structure
 
01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
if anything happens would be a fairly
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
High buyer to uh to actually remove
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
someone as is the case in many states
 
01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
and I'd also point out to you question
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
that this committee now has the measure
 
01:25:52.729 --> 01:25:52.739 align:start position:0%
and uh obviously you can amend it or
 
01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
change some wording
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
um that that's uh an option that you
 
01:25:57.719 --> 01:25:58.610 align:start position:0%
um that that's uh an option that you
have

01:25:58.610 --> 01:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um
 
01:26:02.689 --> 01:26:02.699 align:start position:0%
one additional question I understand
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
that you believe that the
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
that this enabling legislation is
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
necessary first prior to a bill coming
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
back in a subsequent year in order to
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
create the actual procedure I have that
 
01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
correct correct that's what I was uh led
 
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
to believe was that this is necessary
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
before we can
 
01:26:26.689 --> 01:26:26.699 align:start position:0%
we need to do this before any bills can
 
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
be considered down the road
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
uh thank you there there appears that
 
01:26:31.139 --> 01:26:31.970 align:start position:0%
uh thank you there there appears that
they're

01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:31.980 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
was a bill that filed last year
 
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
um in election law
 
01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:38.689 align:start position:0%
um in election law
um

01:26:38.689 --> 01:26:38.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
and and nothing was mentioned that I'm
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
reading here that mentions that there
 
01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.709 align:start position:0%
reading here that mentions that there
was

01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
a problem with the process that enabling
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
legislation was necessary
 
01:26:50.699 --> 01:26:51.530 align:start position:0%
legislation was necessary
um

01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
did that come up in that
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
I I thank you for the question I don't
 
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
know of that we have a process I
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
have been around a while and I've never
 
01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
heard of any uh recall election because
 
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure of the specific election
 
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
law measure you're referring to
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple other folks here
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
who maybe could could speak to that but
 
01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.390 align:start position:0%
who maybe could could speak to that but
again

01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
such a bill I don't think it would
 
01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:22.010 align:start position:0%
such a bill I don't think it would
could

01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:27:24.729 --> 01:27:24.739 align:start position:0%
pass muster constitutionally without
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
this uh this little change here okay
 
01:27:31.129 --> 01:27:31.139 align:start position:0%
thank you is there um I understand that
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
that bill could could be anything could
 
01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:34.430 align:start position:0%
that bill could could be anything could
say

01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
multiple years could say anything
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question question
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
no that's not a question okay
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
um this is the question
 
01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:47.219 align:start position:0%
what would your belief be
 
01:27:47.219 --> 01:27:47.810 align:start position:0%
what would your belief be
um

01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
what would you like it to see that it
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
that it only it handles
 
01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
three and four and multiple years beyond
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
that because certainly there is a time
 
01:27:59.930 --> 01:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
frame that this process would have to
 
01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:01.729 align:start position:0%
frame that this process would have to
take

01:28:01.729 --> 01:28:01.739 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
um and also what what is your belief for
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
who would pay for that process is that
 
01:28:09.729 --> 01:28:09.739 align:start position:0%
something that would be a state
 
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
responsibility or is that the individual
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
Community or is that the petitioners
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
that bring forth this process what is it
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
that you would like to see happen
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you a great question uh a couple
 
01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
parts to it uh to the two three four
 
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
year thing uh again I'm really not
 
01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
concerned particularly about the
 
01:28:33.770 --> 01:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
two-year terms as I said earlier this is
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
really aimed at the three and four year
 
01:28:39.649 --> 01:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
terms and as to who if some sort of a
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
recompoc yes it's a good point you know
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
in California where I spend considerable
 
01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:45.550 align:start position:0%
in California where I spend considerable
time

01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
they've had Recon elections and they
 
01:28:51.169 --> 01:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
there is a cost to that who would bear
 
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
um I can't say here we're getting down
 
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
in the weeds a little bit in terms of
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
implementing a recall procedure
 
01:29:02.209 --> 01:29:02.219 align:start position:0%
if a and that's the beauty of the or the
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
fun part of this I think if if the
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
legislature ever gets a chance to
 
01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:10.139 align:start position:0%
consider a recall measure uh what if
 
01:29:10.139 --> 01:29:10.870 align:start position:0%
consider a recall measure uh what if
they

01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
the wording I'm not sure would it allow
 
01:29:16.330 --> 01:29:16.340 align:start position:0%
a municipality if they felt a need to
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
say okay we need a certain percentage of
 
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
petitioners to
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
um have a recall election whatever that
 
01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
buyer may be I'm not going to say here
 
01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
and then if the municipality wants to
 
01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
um kick out a
 
01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:35.219 align:start position:0%
a school board member or select board
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
member or whatever knowing what that
 
01:29:40.689 --> 01:29:40.699 align:start position:0%
cost May entail then the the school the
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
locality the municipality would decide
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh we're gonna have a warrant
 
01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
article or we'll have some mechanism or
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
some fun to draw from to pay for this
 
01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
election yeah that's a great question
 
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
but that that and I'm glad you asked
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
that because that's the type of
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
thing discussion points that I would
 
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
like to I think a lot of people like to
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
see occur but it can't unless we give
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature a chance to entertain
 
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
such a proposal
 
01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr you're
 
01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
welcome in the legislative
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
I have no further pink cards are there
 
01:30:31.129 --> 01:30:31.139 align:start position:0%
any other members of the audience that
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
would like to test by
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll close the hearing on
 
01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:39.590 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll close the hearing on
cher3

01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we've got a minute or two to reset
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
and then we will be going on to cacr
 
01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.209 align:start position:0%
and then we will be going on to cacr
four

01:30:47.209 --> 01:30:47.219 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:34:18.890 --> 01:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
it would be two rep Stapleton number one
 
01:34:27.050 --> 01:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
yeah and then no this is this is a
 
01:34:28.970 --> 01:34:28.980 align:start position:0%

my bill here cacr4
 
01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:11.300 align:start position:0%
is to amend the New Hampshire
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
Constitution at part 1 article 15.
 
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:18.420 align:start position:0%

01:35:20.209 --> 01:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
from the amounts last set in 1889
 
01:35:27.649 --> 01:35:27.659 align:start position:0%
to some reasonably contemporary monetary
 
01:35:27.659 --> 01:35:29.689 align:start position:0%
to some reasonably contemporary monetary

values
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislators are the most
 
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
notoriously underpaid public servants in
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
the entire nation
 
01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
while mileage compensation has been
 
01:35:41.930 --> 01:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
upgraded over time to contemporary or
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
immunity rates the time service
 
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
compensation has been stagnant since
 
01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:49.310 align:start position:0%
compensation has been stagnant since
1889.

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
1889.
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
and as paltry compared to all other U.S
 
01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:55.310 align:start position:0%
and as paltry compared to all other U.S
states

01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:36:00.729 --> 01:36:00.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
www.ncsl.org that has research on
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
legislator compensation from 2022 in all
 
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
of the states and territories of the U.S
 
01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
and from that Source
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
um I did pull some examples of the
 
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
extremes of compensation and this I was
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
able to acquire from the legislative
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
research services
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
the average of all of the states and
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
territories paid legislator is about
 
01:36:37.129 --> 01:36:37.139 align:start position:0%
forty thousand dollars a year
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
in 41 States providing annual salaries
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
from a low of one hundred dollars for
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
to a hundred and fourteen thousand eight
 
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventy seven dollars a year
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.729 --> 01:36:55.739 align:start position:0%
for nine other states daily or weekly
 
01:36:58.750 --> 01:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
rates are paid with additional per diem
 
01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
averaging 284 dollars a day
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
which you've extended assuming three
 
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
days per week for six months of
 
01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
attendance work
 
01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
would be roughly equivalent to twenty
 
01:37:12.169 --> 01:37:12.179 align:start position:0%
two thousand one hundred and fifty two
 
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
dollars annually
 
01:37:17.209 --> 01:37:17.219 align:start position:0%
for instance in neighboring Maine the
 
01:37:21.370 --> 01:37:21.380 align:start position:0%
biennium salary for 2022 is 26
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
416 dollars
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
plus seventy dollars a day for meals and
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
miles are lodging per diem
 
01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
well in Vermont the salary is 743
 
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
dollars a week
 
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
during session plus per diem of 75
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
dollars a day
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
for remote attendance
 
01:37:44.689 --> 01:37:44.699 align:start position:0%

make the bill
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%

the proposed Bill discounts or reduces

said by roughly 23 percent
 
01:38:54.370 --> 01:38:54.380 align:start position:0%
um very very roughly and quick figures
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
it took five thousand dollars by Nam
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
times 400 reps that's two million
 
01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:02.149 align:start position:0%

01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:29.540 align:start position:0%
divide it in half for your annual cost
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
1.139 million
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
not a lot of money
 
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
compared to this
 
01:39:38.209 --> 01:39:38.219 align:start position:0%
size of the state budget and what we
 
01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
spend and inflation
 
01:39:43.149 --> 01:39:43.159 align:start position:0%
to take care of
 
01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
expenses in a decent way of remuneration

to Representatives
 
01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's situation of regressive
 
01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
service compensation is discriminatory
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
and then it tends to exclude interested
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
and qualified citizens from serving in
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
owing to their need to earn wages for
 
01:40:05.689 --> 01:40:05.699 align:start position:0%
their interests for their assistance and
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
to provide for their families
 
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
tends to narrow the range of service to
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
retired persons or those of fairly well
 
01:40:12.719 --> 01:40:14.450 align:start position:0%
retired persons or those of fairly well
means

01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
otherwise for persons not so well
 
01:40:16.739 --> 01:40:17.990 align:start position:0%
otherwise for persons not so well
situated

01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
situated
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
but desirous of commit committing their
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
time talent and experience to the
 
01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:23.689 align:start position:0%
time talent and experience to the
service

01:40:23.689 --> 01:40:23.699 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:40:26.090 --> 01:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
they are disadvantaged
 
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
by expenses Beyond transportation
 
01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
such as for office clerical support
 
01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
postage meals lodging Child Care debts
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
exceeding campaign fundraising
 
01:40:41.330 --> 01:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
and even hired substitutes for their own
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
chores at home
 
01:40:45.530 --> 01:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
not to mention the inflationary
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
increases of food
 
01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
real estate rents heating fuels today
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
and electricity
 
01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
and also for the general inflation
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
that we've experienced in the last few
 
01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:01.250 align:start position:0%
that we've experienced in the last few
years

01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
for instance I heard very recently that
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
the 1979 U.S dollar is now worth 21
 
01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:09.830 align:start position:0%
the 1979 U.S dollar is now worth 21
cents

01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
cents
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
and we're still operating on 1889 value
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
something's wrong there
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
so I bring forward this uh
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
proposal to bring some sense of equity
 
01:41:29.410 --> 01:41:29.420 align:start position:0%
and fairness to legislation compensation
 
01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:32.699 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't cover the complete
 
01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
need but it's a start and perhaps it may
 
01:41:39.169 --> 01:41:39.179 align:start position:0%
be reasonable enough for voters to say
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that is fair
 
01:41:45.169 --> 01:41:45.179 align:start position:0%
this won't come to the voters until 2024
 
01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
so none of us are going to be enriched

01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
do you have any insight or or knowledge
 
01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
as to the workload that the legislature
 
01:42:38.330 --> 01:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
brought upon itself when this rate was
 
01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
last set in 1889.
 
01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry when it when it last what when
 
01:42:45.890 --> 01:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
it was last set in 1889 what what was
 
01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
what was the workload of a legislator
 
01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:50.330 align:start position:0%
what was the workload of a legislator
then

01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:53.689 --> 01:42:53.699 align:start position:0%
From the Rough read that I recall that
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
particular year there was an extensive
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
amount of work being done in the
 
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
legislature there was
 
01:43:04.729 --> 01:43:04.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of public consideration over a
 
01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:07.139 align:start position:0%
railroad matters
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
and this is just a rough recall of that
 
01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
read that
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature decided at the same time
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
to increase the rates
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
but then there was public outcry from a
 
01:43:25.609 --> 01:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
year prior when there was a lot of
 
01:43:28.609 --> 01:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
legislative activity through the summer
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
through much of the summer which caused
 
01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
a great deal of expense to the state
 
01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
that's a very rough recall of the read
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.370 --> 01:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
no seeing none thank you very much for
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%

I don't know who the other ones are
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
there's a group of them they never cash
 
01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
their uh checks and they said we want
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
you to abide by the law and and one of
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
the good things I like Monica she she
 
01:49:27.530 --> 01:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
says yeah if you can get the legislators
 
01:49:29.689 --> 01:49:29.699 align:start position:0%
to tell me to go down with a suitcase
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
full of greenbacks to the Federal
 
01:49:34.010 --> 01:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
Reserve in Boston to redeem them under
 
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
title 12 U.S code section 411 where the
 
01:49:39.169 --> 01:49:39.179 align:start position:0%
state trooper you know to be like a
 
01:49:41.570 --> 01:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
bonded agent so that we can get the
 
01:49:43.609 --> 01:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
money for all of you then she'll do it
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
but she needs a directive from you to do
 
01:49:47.629 --> 01:49:47.639 align:start position:0%
it and so that would be the alternative
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
to do that rather than do uh what's in
 
01:49:53.330 --> 01:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
this bill of going into debased money
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know uh cost of living adjustment
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
Cola c-o-l-a I mean I see that in line
 
01:50:05.810 --> 01:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
number 14.
 
01:50:08.209 --> 01:50:08.219 align:start position:0%
uh you know the constitution on the
 
01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
ratio from gold it says gold and silver
 
01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
coin dick Marple used to say well give
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
us some Spanish Mill dollars
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
and no that's well that's the other bill
 
01:50:18.890 --> 01:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to that in a minute
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
but uh all this Cola stuff us us jurors
 
01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
on jury duty our also RSA 500-a colon
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
15. we've been we're to be paid ten
 
01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
dollars a half day
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars a day now each one of
 
01:50:33.239 --> 01:50:34.370 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars a day now each one of
those

01:50:34.370 --> 01:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
dollars if we got it is worth twenty
 
01:50:39.169 --> 01:50:39.179 align:start position:0%
dollars in debase metal so if we got
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
silver dollars the twenty dollars a day
 
01:50:44.209 --> 01:50:44.219 align:start position:0%
would be worth 20 times that that'd be
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
400 a day
 
01:50:47.930 --> 01:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
so when the sponsor said something like
 
01:50:50.450 --> 01:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
400 and something dollars then it equals
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
out but if it goes up then just ask the
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
state treasurer for more gold coins next
 
01:50:56.689 --> 01:50:56.699 align:start position:0%
time than the silver that's the solution
 
01:51:00.290 --> 01:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
I think that's all I have to say
 
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you uh would you entertain any
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
questions sure
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
 
01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:09.300 align:start position:0%

the prime sponsor representative Santana

the prime sponsor representative Santana
estacio

02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
estacio
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
welcome to legislative Administration
 
02:02:19.070 --> 02:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you chairman and
 
02:02:20.890 --> 02:02:20.900 align:start position:0%
members of the legislative out of
 
02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
administration committee so this bill's
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
actually been in New Hampshire house I
 
02:02:28.129 --> 02:02:28.139 align:start position:0%
think twice before first introduced by
 
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
dick Marple in 2017 is House Bill 541 FN
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and I bring it back to the legislator
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh because it's constitutionally
 
02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
required uh but also uh it represents a
 
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of Law and money that's uh
 
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
being forgotten and uh if the type of
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
understanding and thinking must be
 
02:02:48.599 --> 02:02:50.149 align:start position:0%
understanding and thinking must be
survived

02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
survived
 
02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
um because we've deviated so far away
 
02:02:54.770 --> 02:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
from the Constitution uh people young
 
02:02:57.649 --> 02:02:57.659 align:start position:0%
people today uh deviate from the
 
02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
thinking of men like dick Marple uh that
 
02:03:03.890 --> 02:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
actually believed in these you know this
 
02:03:07.129 --> 02:03:07.139 align:start position:0%
law uh and now people just understand
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
which I would say correctly that no one
 
02:03:12.290 --> 02:03:12.300 align:start position:0%
cares or follows the Constitution and it
 
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
has uh no effect on the American
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
government or the New Hampshire
 
02:03:18.169 --> 02:03:18.179 align:start position:0%
government except as rhetoric uh
 
02:03:20.410 --> 02:03:20.420 align:start position:0%
lisander Spooner wrote in
 
02:03:23.810 --> 02:03:23.820 align:start position:0%
1867 but whether the Constitution really
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
be one thing or another this much is
 
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
certain that is either authorized such a
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
government as we have had or it has been
 
02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
powerless to prevent it in either case
 
02:03:35.689 --> 02:03:35.699 align:start position:0%
it is unfit to exist so a lot of people
 
02:03:38.570 --> 02:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
are kind of you know partial to that
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
kind of argument nowadays
 
02:03:42.350 --> 02:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
um so and with the Constitution
 
02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
meaningless people are concluding that
 
02:03:46.370 --> 02:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
the only reason government has any
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
Authority is solely because it has might
 
02:03:50.810 --> 02:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
through what it maintains organized
 
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
militia made up of police tax collectors
 
02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
in its Army uh not because there's
 
02:03:58.070 --> 02:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
actually uh underlying law that governs
 
02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
it so in Article 1 Section 10 in the U.S
 
02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
Constitution it says no State shall
 
02:04:05.089 --> 02:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
enter into any treaty Alliance or
 
02:04:05.099 --> 02:04:06.530 align:start position:0%
enter into any treaty Alliance or
Confederation

02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
Confederation
 
02:04:09.890 --> 02:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
uh Grant letters are my q and reprisal
 
02:04:12.410 --> 02:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
coin money admit bills of credit make
 
02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
anything but gold and silver coin a
 
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
tender in payments of debt
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
pass any bill of attainer ex post facto
 
02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
law or law impairing the obligation of
 
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
contracts or any Grant any title of
 
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
nobility so obviously the key point
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
there is make anything uh but gold and
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
silver coin to Tender in payment of
 
02:04:33.890 --> 02:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
debts so it's just illegal for the state
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
to clear debt and anything besides gold
 
02:04:38.350 --> 02:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
and silver coin uh
 
02:04:42.169 --> 02:04:42.179 align:start position:0%
and uh so just to be clear this Clause
 
02:04:44.330 --> 02:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
only applies to the states so the
 
02:04:46.129 --> 02:04:46.139 align:start position:0%
federal government and corporations and
 
02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
people uh can use uh the modern uh
 
02:04:53.209 --> 02:04:53.219 align:start position:0%
corporate dollar to clear debt
 
02:04:53.219 --> 02:04:54.430 align:start position:0%
corporate dollar to clear debt
um

02:04:54.430 --> 02:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
uh so but the states are prohibited for
 
02:04:57.900 --> 02:04:58.910 align:start position:0%
uh so but the states are prohibited for
that

02:04:58.910 --> 02:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
um came up last time this bill was
 
02:05:03.649 --> 02:05:03.659 align:start position:0%
introduced a question about
 
02:05:03.659 --> 02:05:04.550 align:start position:0%
introduced a question about
um

02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:05.750 align:start position:0%
um
if

02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
legislators could receive payment by
 
02:05:09.890 --> 02:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
direct deposit or just opt out of
 
02:05:12.109 --> 02:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
receiving silver coin uh it turns out
 
02:05:14.689 --> 02:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
they can it was decided in the 1923 case
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
Farmers Bank for the Federal Reserve
 
02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
Bank that if individual consents to
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
receiving payment uh by check you know
 
02:05:23.089 --> 02:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
from a state then it wouldn't be in
 
02:05:25.490 --> 02:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
violation article on Section 10. so uh
 
02:05:27.649 --> 02:05:27.659 align:start position:0%
the state is not obligated to if the
 
02:05:29.570 --> 02:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
receiving party consents to not
 
02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
receiving gold and silver coin
 
02:05:35.689 --> 02:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
all right uh so practically this is a a
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
good solution uh better than the
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
previously introduced bill uh so this
 
02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
bill directs the state to obtain uh from
 
02:05:45.890 --> 02:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
the U.S mint uh one ounce dollar silver
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
coins to pay the debt
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
um there was some testimony submitted by
 
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horgan and he was just like
 
02:05:52.910 --> 02:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
talking about what coins dick Marple
 
02:05:54.770 --> 02:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
would have wanted to use or what coins
 
02:05:56.510 --> 02:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
he thinks they would use
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to clarify that so
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
the coin that actually gave out and is
 
02:06:04.010 --> 02:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
circulating around is a U.S silver uh
 
02:06:05.450 --> 02:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
American Eagle
 
02:06:07.550 --> 02:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh that's a bullion coin product that
 
02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:10.739 align:start position:0%
the U.S mint uh produces and it's the
 
02:06:12.410 --> 02:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
closest to spot coin it's likely the
 
02:06:15.649 --> 02:06:15.659 align:start position:0%
it's the most obvious choice uh coin
 
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
that would use
 
02:06:18.649 --> 02:06:18.659 align:start position:0%
um and then just to let you know that
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
gold bar that I passed around it's not
 
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
super relevant to the bill except that
 
02:06:26.209 --> 02:06:26.219 align:start position:0%
it's from dick marbles estate uh so I
 
02:06:27.890 --> 02:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
thought it would be yeah it's a good way
 
02:06:29.689 --> 02:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
to honor them is I don't think there's a
 
02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
better way to iron them to own some of
 
02:06:32.450 --> 02:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
his gold
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh all right
 
02:06:34.199 --> 02:06:35.629 align:start position:0%
uh all right
uh

02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
so the 90 uh silver that uh Oregon was
 
02:06:41.450 --> 02:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
talking about uh the we wouldn't be able
 
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
to obtain that that they don't make that
 
02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
anymore so it would just be the American
 
02:06:46.370 --> 02:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
silver eagles and then the other coin he
 
02:06:49.250 --> 02:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
brought up which was a modern uh
 
02:06:51.950 --> 02:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
like revision of that coin
 
02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:52.609 align:start position:0%
like revision of that coin
um

02:06:52.609 --> 02:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:55.010 --> 02:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
the 90 stuff that's like a collectible
 
02:06:56.990 --> 02:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't it wouldn't make sense
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
for us to obtain that to pay it out even
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
though it would still be legal uh
 
02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
so anyway so it's a good solution uh
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
these coins they're they're silver coins
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
they're globally recognized bullion
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
coins they're accepted as money in any
 
02:07:15.649 --> 02:07:15.659 align:start position:0%
country uh anywhere uh the previous uh
 
02:07:17.149 --> 02:07:17.159 align:start position:0%
build introduction is talking about a
 
02:07:18.609 --> 02:07:18.619 align:start position:0%
lot about these problems with inflation
 
02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
Silver's like automatically adjusts for
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
inflation uh see we don't have to come
 
02:07:26.930 --> 02:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
to the legislator and change the law all
 
02:07:29.330 --> 02:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
the time if we just follow the law
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
because the same 200 if you actually
 
02:07:34.850 --> 02:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
multiply it out uh
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
so I checked the price yesterday and
 
02:07:36.480 --> 02:07:37.250 align:start position:0%
so I checked the price yesterday and
silver

02:07:37.250 --> 02:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
silver
 
02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
ounce a troy ounce of silver which is
 
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
what that coin is it's a one dollar coin
 
02:07:45.290 --> 02:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh melt value is 23.88 200 200 ounces
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
that comes out to 4776 dollars so it's
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
remarkable how close that is to the
 
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
inflation numbers you know from the
 
02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
previous bill so we wouldn't have to
 
02:07:56.209 --> 02:07:56.219 align:start position:0%
think about this I mean silver would
 
02:07:59.149 --> 02:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
just automatically adjust the pay to to
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
keep it the same the same level of pay
 
02:08:02.750 --> 02:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
without changing the law or anything
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
like this
 
02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:05.089 align:start position:0%
like this
um

02:08:05.089 --> 02:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:07.250 --> 02:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
now the problem with the previous spill
 
02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
cacr4 if it did pass then it and then it
 
02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
was determined that it is
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
constitutionally required that the state
 
02:08:17.930 --> 02:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
pay in lawful money then we'd have to
 
02:08:19.850 --> 02:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
you know at five thousand dollars the
 
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
state would acquire silver at 120 000 uh
 
02:08:26.209 --> 02:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
per legislator would be the cost so
 
02:08:29.149 --> 02:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's why this was one reason why we
 
02:08:32.209 --> 02:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
should avoid cacr4 and we could actually
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
pass this or cacr4 require a super
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
majority of being a constitutional
 
02:08:38.450 --> 02:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
amendment is going to require a super
 
02:08:41.810 --> 02:08:41.820 align:start position:0%
majority and a vote to the public
 
02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:42.890 align:start position:0%
majority and a vote to the public
um

02:08:42.890 --> 02:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
so uh just another thing uh some people
 
02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
are just confused like Timothy Horgan he
 
02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
wanted to he asked for amendment I do
 
02:08:53.330 --> 02:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate him uh paying attention to
 
02:08:56.089 --> 02:08:56.099 align:start position:0%
this bill but he wanted an amendment to
 
02:08:57.770 --> 02:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
make it so the state could buy back the
 
02:09:00.169 --> 02:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
silver at market price so the
 
02:09:01.250 --> 02:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
legislators wouldn't have to deal with
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
finding a dealer or something like this
 
02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
if they want to sell it uh that kind of
 
02:09:07.850 --> 02:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
thing wouldn't work because we would we
 
02:09:10.010 --> 02:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
would buy it back at one dollar so you
 
02:09:11.689 --> 02:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
could get your 200 you could actually
 
02:09:13.970 --> 02:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
take that silver eagle and go to the
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
store and just buy something for a
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
dollar it's it's legal tender for one
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
dollar I don't recommend you do
 
02:09:20.930 --> 02:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
something like that but so the state
 
02:09:22.669 --> 02:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
couldn't actually buy it back so we
 
02:09:24.050 --> 02:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
couldn't make an amendment we could we
 
02:09:25.070 --> 02:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
could buy it back at one dollar you
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
could get would you get 200
 
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
um would just be like trading in
 
02:09:30.589 --> 02:09:30.599 align:start position:0%
quarters for five dollar bills or
 
02:09:32.930 --> 02:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
something it wouldn't do anything
 
02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
um but it's highly liquid I mean there's
 
02:09:37.010 --> 02:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
bullion dealers all over the state it's
 
02:09:39.890 --> 02:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
the most liquid thing uh it it's the
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
most liquid thing because it is money
 
02:09:42.770 --> 02:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
there's nothing more liquid than it is
 
02:09:46.729 --> 02:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
the liquid so you can just sell it to
 
02:09:48.649 --> 02:09:48.659 align:start position:0%
anyone actually if if we had this going
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
on the day that the armored cars came to
 
02:09:52.970 --> 02:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
give the silver to the legislators and
 
02:09:54.770 --> 02:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
we were signing out there would be
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
dealers standing outside get ready to
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
buy it from us that's that's how liquid
 
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
it is so there's no problem uh
 
02:10:04.729 --> 02:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
liquidating it or anything like that
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh and then just a couple things about
 
02:10:12.109 --> 02:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
gold and silver you know in uh 1912 JP
 
02:10:14.930 --> 02:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
Morgan State of Congress uh gold is
 
02:10:16.850 --> 02:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
money everything else is credit
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
the thing about gold and silver is it's
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution that's required that
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
the state's paid out but it wasn't just
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
decided at some point in history you
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
know someone just said okay let's just
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
use gold for money uh this gold and
 
02:10:31.550 --> 02:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
silver our money
 
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
naturally uh they're they have all the
 
02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
properties that would make something
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
become money uh the thing is in a
 
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
broader economy we have this problem
 
02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
called double coincidence of wants so if
 
02:10:46.189 --> 02:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
you have a product like uh a telescope
 
02:10:48.890 --> 02:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
and someone else has chicken eggs right
 
02:10:51.050 --> 02:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
the only way you could exchange is if
 
02:10:52.370 --> 02:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
the guy with the chicken eggs wants to
 
02:10:53.689 --> 02:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
telescope and the guy at the telescope
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
wants a chicken eggs it's double
 
02:10:57.770 --> 02:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
coincidence it wants it's uh kind of
 
02:10:59.810 --> 02:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
difficult what actually happens is
 
02:11:01.850 --> 02:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
people would trade to something with
 
02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
higher scalability so the telescope
 
02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
owner would want the chicken eggs even
 
02:11:08.209 --> 02:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
if he didn't actually want them because
 
02:11:09.770 --> 02:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
he knows that someone else wants him
 
02:11:11.209 --> 02:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
whereas telescope is like difficult to
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
sell uh if you ever tried to sell like a
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
helicopter before you see like not very
 
02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
people are in the market for that kind
 
02:11:23.089 --> 02:11:23.099 align:start position:0%
of thing so uh the um if you if you keep
 
02:11:24.530 --> 02:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
doing that you keep compounding that
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
process to the end you end up at Gold so
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh because of the properties it has it's
 
02:11:33.530 --> 02:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
the most salable thing
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
um and so uh so it's a good solution
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
because it solves a problem that's being
 
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
discussed and uh
 
02:11:43.850 --> 02:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
you know it's permanent solution and
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's constitutionally required
 
02:11:48.410 --> 02:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh and New Hampshire is the best stay in
 
02:11:51.169 --> 02:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
the union so I think we should
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
continue doing the tradition tradition
 
02:11:54.530 --> 02:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
of doing things the right way and what
 
02:11:55.810 --> 02:11:55.820 align:start position:0%
some people call the New Hampshire way
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh I mean people say a lot of things
 
02:11:59.810 --> 02:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire and uh one more
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
thing they could say is that we pay our
 
02:12:04.070 --> 02:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
legislators in silver bullion coins
 
02:12:08.209 --> 02:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
uh so uh that's my testimony for the
 
02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
introduction of this bill and I'd love
 
02:12:11.209 --> 02:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
to take questions
 
02:12:13.070 --> 02:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank you are there
 
02:12:15.530 --> 02:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
any questions uh representative Pierce I
 
02:12:18.050 --> 02:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
have two Mr chairman
 
02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:18.830 align:start position:0%
have two Mr chairman
um

02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:21.830 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:12:24.290 --> 02:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
this coin you've provided here
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
represents a dollar as what you said
 
02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
this is a 1976 Bicentennial Dollar by
 
02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
the U.S mint this one came out of
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia I keep this in my wallet
 
02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
you're telling me that with the
 
02:12:40.129 --> 02:12:40.139 align:start position:0%
testimony you just gave so I understand
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
you correctly
 
02:12:44.689 --> 02:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
that with your double and I'll butcher
 
02:12:44.699 --> 02:12:45.470 align:start position:0%
that with your double and I'll butcher
that

02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
your bartering system that this is a
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
dollar and this is not a dollar
 
02:12:52.079 --> 02:12:53.649 align:start position:0%
dollar and this is not a dollar
so

02:12:53.649 --> 02:12:53.659 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:57.410 --> 02:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
uh the definition of a dollar
 
02:12:59.209 --> 02:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
they never defined a dollar when they
 
02:13:01.129 --> 02:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
first like gratify the Constitution it
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
was just
 
02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
the silver currency that was circling at
 
02:13:05.450 --> 02:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
the time
 
02:13:08.689 --> 02:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
which was I think uh 90
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
um and then they went to actually a
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
lower grade when the coin uh was it the
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh coin tender I can't think of it the
 
02:13:21.649 --> 02:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
US the actor make coin uh I can't think
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the word for some reason when they
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
made when they passed that act in set I
 
02:13:27.169 --> 02:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
think uh 17
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
or 1812 I don't remember the point is
 
02:13:33.229 --> 02:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
they actually degraded the value so the
 
02:13:34.970 --> 02:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
the coins that you US Government were
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
minting were like 0.89 instead of uh 0.9
 
02:13:42.530 --> 02:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
so they reduced it but the thing is the
 
02:13:42.540 --> 02:13:43.490 align:start position:0%
so they reduced it but the thing is the
only

02:13:43.490 --> 02:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:13:45.649 --> 02:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
dollar coin that's being produced right
 
02:13:47.689 --> 02:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
now is the American Eagle that's a 90
 
02:13:50.810 --> 02:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
that's a 100 silver coin and the coin
 
02:13:54.290 --> 02:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
you have has less silver in it so if any
 
02:13:56.330 --> 02:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
yeah so I understand what you're saying
 
02:14:00.530 --> 02:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
that it changed uh and it has changed
 
02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:01.430 align:start position:0%
that it changed uh and it has changed
um

02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
but if they made a one dollar silver
 
02:14:06.290 --> 02:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
coin that had less silver content in a
 
02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
lower price I I would think that the
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislature should purchase those ones
 
02:14:13.010 --> 02:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh but that's the that's the best value
 
02:14:14.450 --> 02:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
coin that the legislator is going to be
 
02:14:17.810 --> 02:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
able to obtain is the American Eagle
 
02:14:21.530 --> 02:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
my second question is is simply this
 
02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:22.609 align:start position:0%
my second question is is simply this
um

02:14:22.609 --> 02:14:22.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
as someone who seems to be
 
02:14:29.089 --> 02:14:29.099 align:start position:0%
recognizing that value legitimate
 
02:14:31.310 --> 02:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
currency is gold and silver do you own
 
02:14:32.689 --> 02:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
any Bitcoin
 
02:14:32.699 --> 02:14:34.069 align:start position:0%
any Bitcoin
uh

02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:36.290 --> 02:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
what's the relevance of the question the
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
the relevance being that gold and silver
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
is the only legitimate monetary
 
02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:43.790 align:start position:0%
is the only legitimate monetary
device

02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
device
 
02:14:46.250 --> 02:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
okay that Bitcoin is not gold or silver
 
02:14:49.550 --> 02:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to get a grip on so
 
02:14:52.550 --> 02:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
gold and silver is a natural money that
 
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
showed up in the marketplace and then
 
02:14:57.229 --> 02:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution said that the states
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
must pay in gold and silver so it
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't say they must they must pay
 
02:15:03.589 --> 02:15:03.599 align:start position:0%
debts in Bitcoin but uh anything that
 
02:15:05.149 --> 02:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
can be exchanged and has a unit of
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
account that the market teams is if the
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
market will accept it if people are
 
02:15:11.089 --> 02:15:11.099 align:start position:0%
accepting as money that's what makes it
 
02:15:11.099 --> 02:15:13.010 align:start position:0%
accepting as money that's what makes it
money

02:15:13.010 --> 02:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:15:16.189 --> 02:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have one
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
um we need to see who you're
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
representing on here for the
 
02:15:29.089 --> 02:15:29.099 align:start position:0%
oh yeah it's uh the towns of rins
 
02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:37.129 --> 02:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
and it is uh District what
 
02:15:40.370 --> 02:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
uh Cheshire 18.
 
02:15:42.890 --> 02:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:43.850 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:15:43.850 --> 02:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:46.330 --> 02:15:46.340 align:start position:0%
chair will recognize
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chair and members of
 
02:16:02.209 --> 02:16:02.219 align:start position:0%
the committee once again Walt Stapleton
 
02:16:04.609 --> 02:16:04.619 align:start position:0%
from Sullivan County District Six
 
02:16:07.810 --> 02:16:07.820 align:start position:0%
representing Claremont and Croydon
 
02:16:11.089 --> 02:16:11.099 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting testimony of Prior
 
02:16:15.169 --> 02:16:15.179 align:start position:0%
witness here I'd love to be paid in
 
02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
silver gold coins I happen to like
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
coinage and the history of it it's quite
 
02:16:21.599 --> 02:16:24.050 align:start position:0%
coinage and the history of it it's quite
intriguing

02:16:24.050 --> 02:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
intriguing
 
02:16:26.930 --> 02:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
um however that's not our standard of
 
02:16:28.910 --> 02:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
exchange today we went off gold and
 
02:16:30.589 --> 02:16:30.599 align:start position:0%
silver standard
 
02:16:33.110 --> 02:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
a while back
 
02:16:36.290 --> 02:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
and then in 245 the bill doesn't
 
02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:37.849 align:start position:0%
and then in 245 the bill doesn't
represent

02:16:37.849 --> 02:16:37.859 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:16:40.429 --> 02:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
um to what extent the purity of the
 
02:16:43.790 --> 02:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
silver payment would be and interesting
 
02:16:46.849 --> 02:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
discussion that proceeded here relative
 
02:16:50.509 --> 02:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
to the devaluation of the silver content
 
02:16:54.410 --> 02:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
in one particular coin versus another
 
02:16:56.450 --> 02:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
um leaves that one wide open
 
02:16:59.450 --> 02:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
so there's a technical fault I believe
 
02:17:01.209 --> 02:17:01.219 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
02:17:05.330 --> 02:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
but it's it's not reasonable our medium
 
02:17:07.070 --> 02:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
of Exchange
 
02:17:09.950 --> 02:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
is what it is in the U.S dollar and it's
 
02:17:12.049 --> 02:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
not backed by silver
 
02:17:15.250 --> 02:17:15.260 align:start position:0%
or gold it's a Federal Reserved
 
02:17:18.410 --> 02:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
denomination basically and you know we
 
02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
got to work with what we've got instead
 
02:17:22.490 --> 02:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
of Reinventing the wheel and occurring
 
02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:25.580 align:start position:0%
additional cost in the state for another
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
monetary distribution system
 
02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
so I'd be opposed to 245 FN
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you would you take questions yeah
 
02:17:40.849 --> 02:17:40.859 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
02:17:43.549 --> 02:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
seeing none I spoke prematurely sorry
 
02:17:46.730 --> 02:17:46.740 align:start position:0%

02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
silver dollar
 
02:19:01.559 --> 02:19:03.169 align:start position:0%
silver dollar
uh

02:19:03.169 --> 02:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
in 2021 the U.S mint minted
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
some Morgan a piece silver dollars again
 
02:19:13.849 --> 02:19:13.859 align:start position:0%
two years ago and they were for sale at
 
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
premium prices of 85 dollars a piece
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
but if you wanted to buy
 
02:19:22.610 --> 02:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
them later this year they're reactive
 
02:19:24.049 --> 02:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
again again because last year they
 
02:19:25.730 --> 02:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
didn't do any they're going to do it
 
02:19:27.049 --> 02:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
again and they're going to be less
 
02:19:29.450 --> 02:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
they're going to be 75 but there's going
 
02:19:32.690 --> 02:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
to be more mintage so the Rarity is not
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
there that's why it's coming down and
 
02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:36.169 align:start position:0%
there that's why it's coming down and
price

02:19:36.169 --> 02:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
price
 
02:19:41.810 --> 02:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
I think the uh
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
the word legit came up is this uh
 
02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:49.429 align:start position:0%
the word legit came up is this uh
legitimate

02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
02:19:53.170 --> 02:19:53.180 align:start position:0%
and uh I go back to
 
02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:54.889 align:start position:0%
and uh I go back to
well

02:19:54.889 --> 02:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:19:57.530 --> 02:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
the coinage act in 1965 was the one that
 
02:20:00.410 --> 02:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
made the Commerce coins
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
did not ever consent to the coinage act
 
02:20:07.730 --> 02:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
in 1965. I dare anybody to prove me
 
02:20:07.740 --> 02:20:08.510 align:start position:0%
in 1965. I dare anybody to prove me
wrong

02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:10.070 align:start position:0%
wrong
because

02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's the chapter 28
 
02:20:17.389 --> 02:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
laws of New Hampshire of 1794 we did
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
article 12 consent to the coinage act of
 
02:20:20.399 --> 02:20:22.010 align:start position:0%
article 12 consent to the coinage act of
1792.

02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
1792.
 
02:20:24.889 --> 02:20:24.899 align:start position:0%
and in section 20 of that act it
 
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
specifies what government offices are
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be keeping their accounts in
 
02:20:32.810 --> 02:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
is the gold and silver coin
 
02:20:35.870 --> 02:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
gold and silver I say and emphasize and
 
02:20:38.330 --> 02:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
for both
 
02:20:40.730 --> 02:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
and that's still available because the
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
the greenbacks that you have in your
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
wallet I presume they're called Federal
 
02:20:45.889 --> 02:20:45.899 align:start position:0%
Reserve notes
 
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
ious their notes their promises to pay
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
under title 12 of the U.S code section
 
02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:52.910 align:start position:0%
under title 12 of the U.S code section
411

02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
411
 
02:20:55.969 --> 02:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
those are advances to the local banks
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
for what is to follow what is to follow
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
are the gold and silver coins you go to
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
the bank
 
02:21:04.010 --> 02:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
and I learned this through going to the
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
Citizens Bank a few years ago
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
I told dick Marple that that there's a
 
02:21:10.190 --> 02:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
woman up there she says she can get some
 
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
silver dollars for you all you could do
 
02:21:13.550 --> 02:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
is put in a claim
 
02:21:16.370 --> 02:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
and she told me to go read at the
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
library and I read it Title 31 code of
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
federal code of federal regulations
 
02:21:25.969 --> 02:21:25.979 align:start position:0%
100.2 this is all in my email to you of

02:21:29.640 --> 02:21:30.770 align:start position:0%
uh January 19th that that what I
um

02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:35.520 align:start position:0%

9 54 a.m I don't know if you all got it
 
02:21:39.770 --> 02:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
or not
 
02:21:42.469 --> 02:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
but in there
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
I made a three-page printout at 100
 
02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:46.309 align:start position:0%
I made a three-page printout at 100
percent

02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
on the last paragraph before my name and
 
02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:50.030 align:start position:0%
on the last paragraph before my name and
address

02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:21:51.889 --> 02:21:51.899 align:start position:0%
is the article on Section 10 information
 
02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
and all the summer summaries a brief one
 
02:21:57.770 --> 02:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
paragraph summary it spells it right out
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
and I saw Monica
 
02:22:03.170 --> 02:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
the the state treasurer on Friday and I
 
02:22:05.090 --> 02:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
asked her I said
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
if the legislature says that you can
 
02:22:09.530 --> 02:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
take a whole bunch of these greenbacks
 
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
down to the FED in Boston we're in
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
region number one a of 12. with a State
 
02:22:17.690 --> 02:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
Trooper as a bonded Courier sort of to
 
02:22:20.090 --> 02:22:20.100 align:start position:0%

02:22:22.490 --> 02:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
robbed that would would you please get
 
02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
these legislators the gold and silver
 
02:22:27.530 --> 02:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
coin that they're entitled to and she
 
02:22:30.050 --> 02:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
says yes all she needs is a yes from you
 
02:22:33.650 --> 02:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
all and what I'm saying too is I got
 
02:22:36.170 --> 02:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
really upset like what I said on the
 
02:22:38.330 --> 02:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
first cacr there
 
02:22:42.530 --> 02:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
that there were two legislators
 
02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
who said let's get paid up front in
 
02:22:46.610 --> 02:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
January I said no no that's compensation
 
02:22:48.770 --> 02:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
Article 15 part 2 says you're to be
 
02:22:51.170 --> 02:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
rewarded after the fact so what I have
 
02:22:53.929 --> 02:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
done here this is the first draft of an
 
02:22:58.210 --> 02:22:58.220 align:start position:0%
Ethics complaint that I have yet to sign
 
02:23:00.830 --> 02:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
the one page form I'm going to just
 
02:23:02.450 --> 02:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
summarize it and attach that to it I'm
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to file it today I can talk about
 
02:23:06.650 --> 02:23:06.660 align:start position:0%
it right now but I can't once I file it
 
02:23:08.990 --> 02:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be private but I'm going
 
02:23:12.830 --> 02:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
against the two reps on resolution
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
number five of the seventh December
 
02:23:17.450 --> 02:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
house record
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
Osborne and Wilhelm they're the ones
 
02:23:22.010 --> 02:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
that said well let's get paid no no no
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
they violated their Oath by saying that
 
02:23:25.969 --> 02:23:25.979 align:start position:0%
up front they're supposed to be get big
 
02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
compensation ignorance of the law is no
 
02:23:30.050 --> 02:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
excuse but I won't go into that now but
 
02:23:31.250 --> 02:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
I just thought I'd let you know that
 
02:23:33.170 --> 02:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
maybe you could put this on hold until
 
02:23:35.270 --> 02:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
after they make a decision because they
 
02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
might say to Monica yeah well let's try
 
02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
it out let's go get it and if they don't
 
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
pay up you know what happens years ago I
 
02:23:44.450 --> 02:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
found out you had to get five people to
 
02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
put somebody into involuntary bankruptcy
 
02:23:48.770 --> 02:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
and that was just a con anybody can do
 
02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
it I mean all the legislators should say
 
02:23:52.010 --> 02:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
well Monica
 
02:23:54.050 --> 02:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
the fed's given you a hard time we'll
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
file an action in federal court a class
 
02:23:59.690 --> 02:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
action suit against them what are they
 
02:24:01.490 --> 02:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
going to do they're going to make it go

there no they're going to go and get the
 
02:24:10.730 --> 02:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
coins that they can get because that 31
 
02:24:13.969 --> 02:24:13.979 align:start position:0%
CFR says in there off the top of my head
 
02:24:16.190 --> 02:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
it's in the writing in my paperwork it
 
02:24:18.290 --> 02:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
says ever since 1920
 
02:24:20.809 --> 02:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
they there they're a private outfit
 
02:24:23.690 --> 02:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
Bank ever since 1920 they had been given
 
02:24:27.889 --> 02:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
the authority of the assistant
 
02:24:29.990 --> 02:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
treasurers of the United States to
 
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
requisition coins at face value
 
02:24:35.389 --> 02:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
from the U.S mint and that's all you got
 
02:24:37.250 --> 02:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
to do is put in a claim I've asked a lot
 
02:24:38.690 --> 02:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
of these banks around here well could
 
02:24:40.849 --> 02:24:40.859 align:start position:0%
you write that uh letter down there and
 
02:24:43.190 --> 02:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
get it oh no we're too busy blah blah
 
02:24:44.570 --> 02:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah
 
02:24:47.090 --> 02:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
but you know the government is forced
 
02:24:48.530 --> 02:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
that's what George Washington said I
 
02:24:50.809 --> 02:24:50.819 align:start position:0%
think a long time ago so the forest
 
02:24:57.170 --> 02:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:59.929 --> 02:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
well not bill but I mean uh I guess you
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
could put a Mika security Friend of the
 
02:25:04.130 --> 02:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
Court a friend of the Ethics Committee
 
02:25:06.050 --> 02:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
briefing I guess saying well yeah we
 
02:25:10.010 --> 02:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:13.610 --> 02:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
and one last thing is uh
 
02:25:16.730 --> 02:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
I did get a copy from the LBA
 
02:25:19.790 --> 02:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
of the actual uh
 
02:25:21.770 --> 02:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
02:25:24.410 --> 02:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
and on page two of three it says it will
 
02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
cost the state one million nine hundred
 
02:25:29.210 --> 02:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
and forty seven thousand dollars and
 
02:25:30.650 --> 02:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
eight dollars
 
02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
to pay off legislators at 4 792 dollars
 
02:25:38.410 --> 02:25:38.420 align:start position:0%
per legislator at the 23.96
 
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
silver price
 
02:25:43.130 --> 02:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
02:25:45.650 --> 02:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
I I told her I said that's only one
 
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
option to get I mean what you're I told
 
02:25:51.290 --> 02:25:51.300 align:start position:0%
her she's a liar and a thief but I told
 
02:25:53.330 --> 02:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
it in a nice manner because I said yes
 
02:25:54.770 --> 02:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
you're correct
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
that that is an option but you're being
 
02:26:00.770 --> 02:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
a liar by omission
 
02:26:03.469 --> 02:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
and I don't know whether Bill Dwyer told
 
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
her or not I think she was working there
 
02:26:06.530 --> 02:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
02:26:09.469 --> 02:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
but I saw the build wire in the Concord
 
02:26:11.450 --> 02:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
district court and he wanted me to sue
 
02:26:12.770 --> 02:26:12.780 align:start position:0%
him he said let's get this thing over
 
02:26:15.530 --> 02:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
with and uh we went over there and one
 
02:26:17.330 --> 02:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
of the Attorney General's assistants he
 
02:26:19.730 --> 02:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
dismisses by Noel Pros they said come on
 
02:26:20.929 --> 02:26:20.939 align:start position:0%
because they were using an attorney
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
general memo of Suzanne Gorman she said
 
02:26:26.030 --> 02:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
well you can take U.S notes you know
 
02:26:27.830 --> 02:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
that gets into another subject I mean
 
02:26:29.870 --> 02:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
you have federal reservative U.S notes
 
02:26:31.610 --> 02:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
we don't need to go to another subject
 
02:26:34.370 --> 02:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
we have enough here with 245 but but I
 
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
I've been working on this since the
 
02:26:38.450 --> 02:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
1980s with f Tupper Saucy I mentioned
 
02:26:41.389 --> 02:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
that last time right and uh he was from
 
02:26:43.370 --> 02:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
Swanee Tennessee he he wrote the book
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
Miracle On Main Street and he published
 
02:26:48.349 --> 02:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
a Main Street Journal back in the 1980s
 
02:26:50.330 --> 02:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
that's how I found dick Marple I said
 
02:26:51.969 --> 02:26:51.979 align:start position:0%
before the other Bill
 
02:26:56.809 --> 02:26:56.819 align:start position:0%
and uh Ed Como you go to New Hampshire
 
02:26:59.450 --> 02:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
government oversight.com you can contact
 
02:27:01.610 --> 02:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
Ed Como through there he even filmed
 
02:27:03.770 --> 02:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
dick if you go to Google you go on to
 
02:27:07.070 --> 02:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
Marple money and there's a nice four uh
 
02:27:09.530 --> 02:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
minute video of him explaining what
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson had with his
 
02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
coins and dick got into uh paper money
 
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
too okay
 
02:27:18.110 --> 02:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
and I think that's all I have to say
 
02:27:21.170 --> 02:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
right other than maybe let me made some
 
02:27:23.090 --> 02:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
notes Here
 
02:27:25.790 --> 02:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh oh one last thing
 
02:27:27.650 --> 02:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
one last thing yeah
 
02:27:30.050 --> 02:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
it's uh what is it now no no it's all
 
02:27:34.429 --> 02:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
right one last thing yep uh
 
02:27:37.969 --> 02:27:37.979 align:start position:0%
one last thing is section 16 part 15 of
 
02:27:41.450 --> 02:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. all
 
02:27:43.370 --> 02:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
those Federal Reserve notes
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
are to be they're not monetized
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
monetized mean that they buy them for
 
02:27:50.330 --> 02:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
six cents a piece from the Bureau of
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
Engraving and printing U.S Bureau of
 
02:27:54.650 --> 02:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
Engraving printing they get the the
 
02:27:56.510 --> 02:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
paper dollars they're actually cotton
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
dollars from crane paper company in
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
Dalton Mass my uncle had a cotton
 
02:28:03.710 --> 02:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
Plantation in Mississippi so some of
 
02:28:06.349 --> 02:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
that might be in there but uh they they
 
02:28:07.550 --> 02:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
buy them for
 
02:28:09.349 --> 02:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
six cents a piece on the average you
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
know once with the hundred dollar bills
 
02:28:12.050 --> 02:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
with the stripes I think they're a
 
02:28:13.309 --> 02:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
little bit more but anyway so the bottom
 
02:28:14.450 --> 02:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
line is
 
02:28:16.910 --> 02:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh they're not monetized until they go
 
02:28:19.610 --> 02:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
out to the local banks they keep them in
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
storage there once they go out by
 
02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
section 16 part 15 of the federal of the
 
02:28:26.450 --> 02:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserved Act
 
02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
they meaning the federal agents have to
 
02:28:31.969 --> 02:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
give to Uncle Sam's agent
 
02:28:33.889 --> 02:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
either a gold
 
02:28:37.849 --> 02:28:37.859 align:start position:0%
bar or gold in some type of substance
 
02:28:40.010 --> 02:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
or a gold certificate saying we're
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
keeping this uh here and Dick Marple
 
02:28:44.809 --> 02:28:44.819 align:start position:0%
used to say oh yeah why are they doing
 
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
that because they're charging us rent
 
02:28:47.929 --> 02:28:47.939 align:start position:0%
why don't they just put it over in Fort
 
02:28:49.849 --> 02:28:49.859 align:start position:0%
Knox and Fort Knox is probably full who
 
02:28:52.250 --> 02:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
knows I mean last time it was audited it
 
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
was back in the 80s I guess or one of
 
02:28:56.570 --> 02:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
those uh chance audits
 
02:28:56.580 --> 02:28:58.130 align:start position:0%
those uh chance audits
so

02:28:58.130 --> 02:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
there is the gold there and uh if they
 
02:29:03.290 --> 02:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
don't have any silver dollars then they
 
02:29:05.690 --> 02:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
just sell the gold by the silver from
 
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
the U.S mint and pay us all off simple
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
got it let's take a field trip down to
 
02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:12.170 align:start position:0%
got it let's take a field trip down to
Boston

02:29:12.170 --> 02:29:12.180 align:start position:0%

02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:17.640 align:start position:0%

02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
house Clerk
 
02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
Paul Smith

um

02:29:49.190 --> 02:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:51.170 --> 02:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
for the record uh Paul Smith Clerk of
 
02:29:55.309 --> 02:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
the house uh just wanted to um uh remind
 
02:29:58.849 --> 02:29:58.859 align:start position:0%
you that I do not testify in favor nor
 
02:30:00.889 --> 02:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
opposed to any single piece of
 
02:30:02.809 --> 02:30:02.819 align:start position:0%
legislation just here to present you
 
02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
with a couple of facts it's it's
 
02:30:08.270 --> 02:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
interesting a little bit um a little bit
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
fortuitous that we are doing this bill
 
02:30:13.010 --> 02:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
as we did this during uh mock
 
02:30:16.490 --> 02:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
orientation for our new members and I
 
02:30:19.010 --> 02:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
testified much the same then as I play
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
into right now
 
02:30:22.550 --> 02:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
um I I sort of uh just want to just
 
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
mention the the way the bill is drafted
 
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
it does it does specify that 200 coins
 
02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
and troy ounces have to be purchased and
 
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
I would note as the fiscal note states
 
02:30:38.889 --> 02:30:38.899 align:start position:0%
that this has a cost of 200 excuse me
 
02:30:41.630 --> 02:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
23.96 roughly
 
02:30:44.770 --> 02:30:44.780 align:start position:0%
um last month when this was written
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
and that puts compensation total at
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
nearly forty eight hundred dollars we
 
02:30:54.590 --> 02:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
have had two Supreme Court opinions in
 
02:30:56.090 --> 02:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire regarding
 
02:30:58.010 --> 02:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
part two Article 15 which deals with
 
02:31:00.650 --> 02:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
compensation uh specifically related to
 
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
mileage and the sort
 
02:31:06.170 --> 02:31:06.180 align:start position:0%
um and in both of those instances the
 
02:31:10.130 --> 02:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
judges the justices have opined that if
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
you are going to pay more than what is
 
02:31:16.969 --> 02:31:16.979 align:start position:0%
allotted in the Constitution that is
 
02:31:16.979 --> 02:31:18.290 align:start position:0%
allotted in the Constitution that is
unconstitutional

02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
so I would just note that the way this
 
02:31:23.929 --> 02:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
is drafted this particular piece of
 
02:31:27.050 --> 02:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
legislation is drafted it will pay you
 
02:31:29.210 --> 02:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
more than what you are constitutionally
 
02:31:32.090 --> 02:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
allowed to take for your service
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and I think that uh we would probably
 
02:31:40.250 --> 02:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
end up in some litigation over that if
 
02:31:43.490 --> 02:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
this were to be successful
 
02:31:47.150 --> 02:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
um I would note similarly that a uh a
 
02:31:48.770 --> 02:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
bill was brought before this committee
 
02:31:51.290 --> 02:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
last term that sought to create a
 
02:31:54.530 --> 02:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
special class of legislators that were
 
02:31:58.490 --> 02:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
um in in need of financial assistance
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
um in in setting up a a stipend uh
 
02:32:03.469 --> 02:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
administered by the Department of Health
 
02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
and Human Services sort of similar to a
 
02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
welfare program and the
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
Direction at that time as well was again
 
02:32:14.750 --> 02:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
that that would be a violation of part
 
02:32:17.410 --> 02:32:17.420 align:start position:0%
two Article 15 of our state constitution
 
02:32:20.330 --> 02:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
so uh those are those are some some
 
02:32:22.490 --> 02:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
points to be considered when you are

Merrimack District 2. I'm here to
 
04:02:23.450 --> 04:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 301 to you I think
 
04:02:26.269 --> 04:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
this will be one of several meetings
 
04:02:29.809 --> 04:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
that we have on House Bill 301
 
04:02:29.819 --> 04:02:30.830 align:start position:0%
that we have on House Bill 301
um

04:02:30.830 --> 04:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:34.610 --> 04:02:34.620 align:start position:0%
I wanted to just try to give you a brief
 
04:02:38.290 --> 04:02:38.300 align:start position:0%
primer on why this is important
 
04:02:41.809 --> 04:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
as you'll see from the paperwork that
 
04:02:45.969 --> 04:02:45.979 align:start position:0%
are committee researcher put together
 
04:02:49.870 --> 04:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
this has been heard a couple of times
 
04:02:52.929 --> 04:02:52.939 align:start position:0%
last year this committee
 
04:02:55.550 --> 04:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
retained the bill and worked on it a
 
04:02:57.650 --> 04:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
little bit over the summer
 
04:03:01.630 --> 04:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
um I'll start with two quotes from
 
04:03:04.429 --> 04:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
representative Ned Gordon who is the
 
04:03:06.429 --> 04:03:06.439 align:start position:0%
chair of house ethics
 
04:03:09.530 --> 04:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
he said if you read the ethics
 
04:03:12.349 --> 04:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines they seem to imply that as
 
04:03:15.110 --> 04:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
long as you disclose a conflict the
 
04:03:17.630 --> 04:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
individual legislator makes up his or
 
04:03:19.969 --> 04:03:19.979 align:start position:0%
her mind as to whether or not they need
 
04:03:24.110 --> 04:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
to recuse themselves Gordon said but the
 
04:03:26.450 --> 04:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee has in the past as well
 
04:03:29.050 --> 04:03:29.060 align:start position:0%
as in recent informal resolution
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
determined that there are circumstances
 
04:03:34.130 --> 04:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
when recusal is required and should
 
04:03:34.140 --> 04:03:35.450 align:start position:0%
when recusal is required and should
occur

04:03:35.450 --> 04:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
occur
 
04:03:38.450 --> 04:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
that's one quote the other is we have a
 
04:03:40.670 --> 04:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
legislature that is composed of citizens
 
04:03:42.729 --> 04:03:42.739 align:start position:0%
and intended to be a Citizens
 
04:03:45.290 --> 04:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
legislature and they bring their
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
experiences with them we have tried to
 
04:03:49.670 --> 04:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
strike a balance where we don't want
 
04:03:51.769 --> 04:03:51.779 align:start position:0%
people to not be able to use their
 
04:03:54.290 --> 04:03:54.300 align:start position:0%
talents and the information and
 
04:03:56.809 --> 04:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
knowledge they have but at the same time
 
04:04:00.530 --> 04:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
we do need to put in place a system
 
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
when people do have a direct conflict
 
04:04:05.090 --> 04:04:05.100 align:start position:0%
that needs to be recognized and
 
04:04:05.100 --> 04:04:08.090 align:start position:0%
that needs to be recognized and
addressed

04:04:08.090 --> 04:04:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:10.969 --> 04:04:10.979 align:start position:0%
those are both from the Republican chair
 
04:04:14.830 --> 04:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
of the Ethics Committee just as balance
 
04:04:17.889 --> 04:04:17.899 align:start position:0%
is an excellent quote in here aside from
 
04:04:20.229 --> 04:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
our own member
 
04:04:22.610 --> 04:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
representative wall there's one from
 
04:04:25.250 --> 04:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
Timothy Smith that spoke to me and he
 
04:04:28.429 --> 04:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
said in his committee report the
 
04:04:30.349 --> 04:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
minority feels that this proposed
 
04:04:31.969 --> 04:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
amendment to the state constitution
 
04:04:34.849 --> 04:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
represents a logical and prudent measure
 
04:04:36.830 --> 04:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
for legislative reform
 
04:04:39.170 --> 04:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
an amendment to eliminate Financial
 
04:04:41.210 --> 04:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest
 
04:04:43.729 --> 04:04:43.739 align:start position:0%
actions in the legislature would boost
 
04:04:46.070 --> 04:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
public confidence and reassure the
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
voters that we are all here to do their
 
04:04:51.410 --> 04:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
business and not just our own business
 
04:04:53.150 --> 04:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
this is a measure with enormous
 
04:04:55.370 --> 04:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support outside the state
 
04:04:57.889 --> 04:04:57.899 align:start position:0%
house with about 50 constituents
 
04:05:00.290 --> 04:05:00.300 align:start position:0%
contacting the committee testifying or
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
signing the blue sheet in support of the
 
04:05:05.570 --> 04:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
amendment many Express shock that such a
 
04:05:07.790 --> 04:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
provision was not already in our state
 
04:05:07.800 --> 04:05:10.250 align:start position:0%
provision was not already in our state
constitution

04:05:10.250 --> 04:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
04:05:12.889 --> 04:05:12.899 align:start position:0%
that's it for my reading
 
04:05:15.710 --> 04:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
um so what uh what we have
 
04:05:17.450 --> 04:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and what we've undertaken in this
 
04:05:17.460 --> 04:05:18.889 align:start position:0%
um and what we've undertaken in this
committee

04:05:18.889 --> 04:05:18.899 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
um was a way to First establish
 
04:05:25.010 --> 04:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
um or for the first time establish
 
04:05:27.769 --> 04:05:27.779 align:start position:0%
recusal as an option
 
04:05:31.189 --> 04:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
um for legislators
 
04:05:34.550 --> 04:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
and as representative Smith said most
 
04:05:37.870 --> 04:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
are surprised that we don't have that
 
04:05:42.889 --> 04:05:42.899 align:start position:0%
we have uh undertaken with um a couple
 
04:05:46.450 --> 04:05:46.460 align:start position:0%
of the internal people here
 
04:05:50.929 --> 04:05:50.939 align:start position:0%
one of which is Mr Lambert who you may
 
04:05:53.150 --> 04:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
all know when he helped you fill out the
 
04:05:55.250 --> 04:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
disclosure forms
 
04:05:55.260 --> 04:05:56.450 align:start position:0%
disclosure forms
um

04:05:56.450 --> 04:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:00.530 --> 04:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
we've we've tried to look at simplifying
 
04:06:02.229 --> 04:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the key word
 
04:06:04.729 --> 04:06:04.739 align:start position:0%
simplifying that ethics book that we
 
04:06:07.790 --> 04:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
have specifically in the area of
 
04:06:10.010 --> 04:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest
 
04:06:10.020 --> 04:06:11.090 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest
um

04:06:11.090 --> 04:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
this book is
 
04:06:16.969 --> 04:06:16.979 align:start position:0%
complicated I will say it seems that
 
04:06:18.889 --> 04:06:18.899 align:start position:0%
every time
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
a Crossroads came we added a new
 
04:06:25.490 --> 04:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
definition or a new category and I'll
 
04:06:27.229 --> 04:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
give you the example of special interest
 
04:06:30.969 --> 04:06:30.979 align:start position:0%
that in order to
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
clarify for the legislator what they
 
04:06:36.250 --> 04:06:36.260 align:start position:0%
should be doing when they
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
identify a conflict of interest in their
 
04:06:38.880 --> 04:06:40.030 align:start position:0%
identify a conflict of interest in their
own

04:06:40.030 --> 04:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
own
 
04:06:43.849 --> 04:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
day-to-day management of these bills
 
04:06:43.859 --> 04:06:44.990 align:start position:0%
day-to-day management of these bills
but

04:06:44.990 --> 04:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:06:47.929 --> 04:06:47.939 align:start position:0%
we don't seem to
 
04:06:51.590 --> 04:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
have given direction to any of our
 
04:06:51.600 --> 04:06:53.689 align:start position:0%
have given direction to any of our
colleagues

04:06:53.689 --> 04:06:53.699 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
04:06:56.030 --> 04:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
what they should be doing or how they
 
04:06:58.130 --> 04:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
should be thinking and it gets very
 
04:07:00.769 --> 04:07:00.779 align:start position:0%
difficult you haven't experienced it yet
 
04:07:03.050 --> 04:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
if you're a freshman yet but when you're
 
04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
sitting at reps Hall and you're in the
 
04:07:07.370 --> 04:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
middle of a row and you listen to the
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
Parliamentary inquiry and you think to
 
04:07:12.530 --> 04:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
yourself boy I may have a conflict of
 
04:07:15.349 --> 04:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
interest in this and maybe I shouldn't
 
04:07:16.429 --> 04:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
be voting
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
you don't have time to get down to see
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
the clerk and discuss it with him you
 
04:07:24.530 --> 04:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
don't have your home attorney on speed
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
dial and uh and it's too late to get up
 
04:07:30.830 --> 04:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
and and run down the aisle and and claim
 
04:07:32.150 --> 04:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
that you're going to use the men's or
 
04:07:33.229 --> 04:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
ladies room
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
um it's it's unsatisfactory so our goal
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
was always to try to create some type of
 
04:07:41.279 --> 04:07:42.410 align:start position:0%
was always to try to create some type of
guideline

04:07:42.410 --> 04:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
guideline
 
04:07:44.830 --> 04:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
so that reps
 
04:07:47.889 --> 04:07:47.899 align:start position:0%
regardless of who's on their speed dial
 
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
would have confidence when
 
04:07:54.590 --> 04:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
when they should recuse themselves from
 
04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
voting and how to go about that in a in
 
04:07:59.450 --> 04:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
an orderly fashion
 
04:08:03.710 --> 04:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
so we we sat and and
 
04:08:05.809 --> 04:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
um came up with the definition that I
 
04:08:07.070 --> 04:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
think you see
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
um on page two of the bill line 16.
 
04:08:13.429 --> 04:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
um and we said conflict of interest
 
04:08:15.290 --> 04:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
means the condition in which a
 
04:08:18.349 --> 04:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
legislator has a real or perceived
 
04:08:21.410 --> 04:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
financial interest or a non-financial
 
04:08:24.410 --> 04:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
personal interest in any matter which
 
04:08:26.809 --> 04:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
could directly or indirectly affect or
 
04:08:28.790 --> 04:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
influence the performance of the
 
04:08:31.130 --> 04:08:31.140 align:start position:0%
legislators activities
 
04:08:33.710 --> 04:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on and and
 
04:08:36.650 --> 04:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
um talks about financial interest and
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
non-financial personal interest
 
04:08:42.769 --> 04:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
um the financial interest I think is the
 
04:08:46.370 --> 04:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
most common and and probably
 
04:08:48.469 --> 04:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
the area that we're most familiar with
 
04:08:50.469 --> 04:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
when we talk about conflicts of interest
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
because money is involved and that
 
04:08:55.670 --> 04:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
exists where a legislator or someone the
 
04:08:59.210 --> 04:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
legislature legislator cares about could
 
04:09:01.370 --> 04:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
stand to gain or lose anything of
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
material value as a result of the
 
04:09:06.769 --> 04:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:08.710 --> 04:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
um that's money
 
04:09:11.330 --> 04:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
the non-financial personal interest
 
04:09:13.790 --> 04:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
exists where a legislator or someone the
 
04:09:16.130 --> 04:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
legislator cares about has a
 
04:09:18.349 --> 04:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the welfare of an
 
04:09:20.269 --> 04:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
organization by virtue of holding a
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
position with a fiduciary responsibility
 
04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
such as a board member trustee or
 
04:09:25.199 --> 04:09:27.229 align:start position:0%
such as a board member trustee or
director

04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
director
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
when we looked at this in the old
 
04:09:33.050 --> 04:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
language or in the current language I
 
04:09:35.030 --> 04:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
should say in the book
 
04:09:37.250 --> 04:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk about
 
04:09:37.260 --> 04:09:38.630 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk about
um

04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
someone the legislator cares about
 
04:09:44.809 --> 04:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
and that I think is going to be where we
 
04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
have our biggest area of conversation
 
04:09:50.630 --> 04:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
over the next couple of weeks
 
04:09:54.290 --> 04:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
um what we look at now is someone who
 
04:09:57.170 --> 04:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
lives in your household so what we were
 
04:09:59.269 --> 04:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
what we were struggling with over the
 
04:10:02.809 --> 04:10:02.819 align:start position:0%
summer in our work session was at what
 
04:10:05.450 --> 04:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
point from the legislator
 
04:10:09.050 --> 04:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
do we stop worrying about this conflict
 
04:10:10.090 --> 04:10:10.100 align:start position:0%
of interest
 
04:10:12.710 --> 04:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
I call it the concentric Circle Theory
 
04:10:14.330 --> 04:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
you know you just go father and father
 
04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
from the legislator so the book
 
04:10:19.610 --> 04:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
currently talks about people that are in
 
04:10:21.710 --> 04:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
your household
 
04:10:21.720 --> 04:10:23.510 align:start position:0%
your household
yeah

04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:10:27.229 --> 04:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
um I have close friends that I would do
 
04:10:28.610 --> 04:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
anything for
 
04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
um so I to me as I was driving around
 
04:10:34.969 --> 04:10:34.979 align:start position:0%
the state I started thinking about how
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
do I identify this person that I may
 
04:10:40.790 --> 04:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
change how I would vote
 
04:10:43.910 --> 04:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
based on my friendship and and how it
 
04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
would affect him
 
04:10:47.750 --> 04:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
04:10:50.990 --> 04:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
finally in struggling with this we
 
04:10:53.330 --> 04:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
finally came down to the fact that there
 
04:10:55.010 --> 04:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
are some people even though they're in
 
04:10:57.650 --> 04:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
um you may not change your Vote or or
 
04:11:02.330 --> 04:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
recognize that conflict
 
04:11:04.490 --> 04:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
um because of that person so you can't
 
04:11:06.950 --> 04:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
just do this on a genealogy basis you
 
04:11:09.290 --> 04:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
can't just start naming people that are
 
04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
in your family because there may be
 
04:11:13.250 --> 04:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
other people that aren't related to you
 
04:11:16.729 --> 04:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
that you do that you would change your
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
point of view or or how you vote
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
um when when you come to that conflict
 
04:11:22.920 --> 04:11:24.349 align:start position:0%
um when when you come to that conflict
question

04:11:24.349 --> 04:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:11:24.359 --> 04:11:25.610 align:start position:0%
question
so

04:11:25.610 --> 04:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:28.189 --> 04:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
I think that's going to be an area that
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
we need just we need to look at closely
 
04:11:34.010 --> 04:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
but that was the reasoning behind having
 
04:11:36.410 --> 04:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
the language that says someone you care
 
04:11:36.420 --> 04:11:38.689 align:start position:0%
the language that says someone you care
about

04:11:38.689 --> 04:11:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:38.699 --> 04:11:40.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:11:40.189 --> 04:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:44.809 --> 04:11:44.819 align:start position:0%
this is in my mind this is not
 
04:11:47.929 --> 04:11:47.939 align:start position:0%
to be or not required to be a legal
 
04:11:47.939 --> 04:11:49.189 align:start position:0%
to be or not required to be a legal
definition

04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
definition
 
04:11:51.830 --> 04:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
because that's what I uh the opposition
 
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
I get to that phrase is is people that
 
04:11:57.410 --> 04:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
saying well you know who knows who's
 
04:11:59.570 --> 04:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
who's responsible who you care about
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
versus somebody else you know and maybe
 
04:12:05.809 --> 04:12:05.819 align:start position:0%
it's it's nebulous term I don't look at
 
04:12:08.929 --> 04:12:08.939 align:start position:0%
this as from the standpoint of a legal
 
04:12:12.290 --> 04:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
definition even though within our
 
04:12:14.809 --> 04:12:14.819 align:start position:0%
legislative booklet our ethics booklet
 
04:12:18.410 --> 04:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
it does speak to a penalty as far as
 
04:12:21.710 --> 04:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
being a misdemeanor in here
 
04:12:23.929 --> 04:12:23.939 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a mistake I don't I
 
04:12:26.090 --> 04:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
don't see anywhere that the house would
 
04:12:26.100 --> 04:12:27.309 align:start position:0%
don't see anywhere that the house would
ever

04:12:27.309 --> 04:12:27.319 align:start position:0%
ever
 
04:12:31.010 --> 04:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
see a situation where a misdemeanor is
 
04:12:31.020 --> 04:12:32.389 align:start position:0%
see a situation where a misdemeanor is
required

04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
required
 
04:12:36.830 --> 04:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
um but that that's Up For Debate as well
 
04:12:44.210 --> 04:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
um for me this is not a situation that
 
04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm saying to people
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
you shall do this oh I you know I don't
 
04:12:54.410 --> 04:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
morality and and ethics are what you do
 
04:12:56.750 --> 04:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
when no one's watching is is the way
 
04:12:59.090 --> 04:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
I've always described it
 
04:12:59.100 --> 04:12:59.809 align:start position:0%
I've always described it
um

04:12:59.809 --> 04:12:59.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
this is for your own decision to make
 
04:13:05.570 --> 04:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
this is when you have a conflict this is
 
04:13:08.929 --> 04:13:08.939 align:start position:0%
how you evaluate it and and what you
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
believe you should do
 
04:13:13.849 --> 04:13:13.859 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to emphasize however is
 
04:13:16.429 --> 04:13:16.439 align:start position:0%
how you act here
 
04:13:20.929 --> 04:13:20.939 align:start position:0%
or how we act here reflects on all of us
 
04:13:23.630 --> 04:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
so you heard earlier today testimony
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
where one of the representatives said he
 
04:13:27.290 --> 04:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
didn't want to be thought of as a
 
04:13:27.300 --> 04:13:29.030 align:start position:0%
didn't want to be thought of as a
politician

04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
politician
 
04:13:30.650 --> 04:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
I don't know about you but I've heard
 
04:13:33.710 --> 04:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
many times when people try to describe
 
04:13:36.969 --> 04:13:36.979 align:start position:0%
us as politicians alongside Washington
 
04:13:40.490 --> 04:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
politicians and it drives me crazy
 
04:13:40.500 --> 04:13:41.269 align:start position:0%
politicians and it drives me crazy
um

04:13:41.269 --> 04:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:44.570 --> 04:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
I think this is the time that we need to
 
04:13:48.410 --> 04:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
have something in place that allows
 
04:13:51.070 --> 04:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
a guideline or
 
04:13:54.110 --> 04:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
some kind of direction for
 
04:13:56.150 --> 04:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
Representatives especially new
 
04:13:56.160 --> 04:13:57.769 align:start position:0%
Representatives especially new
Representatives

04:13:57.769 --> 04:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
so that they can understand what they
 
04:14:04.370 --> 04:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
should do when they have a concern that
 
04:14:08.830 --> 04:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
their their vote may be influenced
 
04:14:10.849 --> 04:14:10.859 align:start position:0%
differently than what they would
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
normally vote because of their
 
04:14:16.250 --> 04:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
relationships either in other either in
 
04:14:18.590 --> 04:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
other positions like a board member or
 
04:14:21.650 --> 04:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
trustee but also for those people that
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
they are close to so with that I'm happy
 
04:14:24.720 --> 04:14:26.590 align:start position:0%
they are close to so with that I'm happy
to

04:14:26.590 --> 04:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:14:29.210 --> 04:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
end because this is just the beginning
 
04:14:31.490 --> 04:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
of our conversation and and I think
 
04:14:35.570 --> 04:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
maybe questions may be a better Avenue
 
04:14:38.210 --> 04:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm sure that there are
 
04:14:39.650 --> 04:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
questions so if you want to raise your
 
04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
hands and wait to be recognized that
 
04:14:43.849 --> 04:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
would be great
 
04:14:46.610 --> 04:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative pair
 
04:14:50.990 --> 04:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:51.000 --> 04:14:52.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:14:52.250 --> 04:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:54.170 --> 04:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
in the researcher
 
04:14:56.330 --> 04:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
um just where this idea came from was
 
04:14:58.250 --> 04:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
there any discovery of
 
04:15:01.010 --> 04:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
language from other states or even at
 
04:15:04.490 --> 04:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
the federal level to kind of capture
 
04:15:06.769 --> 04:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
the phrase someone the legislator cares
 
04:15:08.630 --> 04:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
about in a different way or more
 
04:15:10.670 --> 04:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
specific or anything like that was there
 
04:15:12.170 --> 04:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
anything about it thank you for your
 
04:15:12.180 --> 04:15:13.490 align:start position:0%
anything about it thank you for your
question

04:15:13.490 --> 04:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:15:16.790 --> 04:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
um you would think so you know obviously
 
04:15:19.550 --> 04:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
they were at least 50 options for us
 
04:15:22.490 --> 04:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
here to uh to look our 49 other options
 
04:15:27.410 --> 04:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
but but it did the ncsl language does go
 
04:15:30.530 --> 04:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
into Puerto Rico and does go into Guam
 
04:15:32.450 --> 04:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
and every other thing so there were a
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
lot of options
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
none had anything like that
 
04:15:37.920 --> 04:15:38.510 align:start position:0%
none had anything like that
um

04:15:38.510 --> 04:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:40.969 --> 04:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
but they were all over the board
 
04:15:44.630 --> 04:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
so some spoke to just the legislator and
 
04:15:46.969 --> 04:15:46.979 align:start position:0%
they didn't care about a spouse
 
04:15:51.170 --> 04:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
some spoke to and maybe actually we can
 
04:15:53.450 --> 04:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
get that information a breakdown of of
 
04:15:55.490 --> 04:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
what each state did if that would be
 
04:15:59.809 --> 04:15:59.819 align:start position:0%
helpful but um they they are they are
 
04:16:01.630 --> 04:16:01.640 align:start position:0%
all across the board
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
the interesting thing to us as we went
 
04:16:07.849 --> 04:16:07.859 align:start position:0%
through the work session was that most
 
04:16:11.630 --> 04:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
of the legislators legislatures
 
04:16:17.929 --> 04:16:17.939 align:start position:0%
try to Force the legis the legislator to
 
04:16:20.330 --> 04:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
vote not
 
04:16:22.670 --> 04:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
get out of the vote
 
04:16:24.769 --> 04:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
um if that makes sense if I'm saying
 
04:16:26.809 --> 04:16:26.819 align:start position:0%
that correctly they they were more
 
04:16:30.370 --> 04:16:30.380 align:start position:0%
concerned with people over using this
 
04:16:34.849 --> 04:16:34.859 align:start position:0%
than actually using this
 
04:16:40.910 --> 04:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative turcott
 
04:16:46.429 --> 04:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank you does this uh language
 
04:16:50.570 --> 04:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
change anything from the Old Law
 
04:16:53.030 --> 04:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
04:16:56.210 --> 04:16:56.220 align:start position:0%
um everything on that on this bowl that
 
04:16:58.849 --> 04:16:58.859 align:start position:0%
everything that is in bold is new
 
04:16:58.859 --> 04:17:02.450 align:start position:0%
everything that is in bold is new
language

04:17:02.450 --> 04:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:04.010 --> 04:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
I guess I didn't understand the question
 
04:17:05.630 --> 04:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
04:17:07.969 --> 04:17:07.979 align:start position:0%
yeah does it change anything from how it
 
04:17:10.010 --> 04:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
was before I mean it's going to be
 
04:17:12.170 --> 04:17:12.180 align:start position:0%
should so it's it's not going to be
 
04:17:12.180 --> 04:17:13.429 align:start position:0%
should so it's it's not going to be
Cheryl

04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
Cheryl
 
04:17:15.530 --> 04:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
so does it change anything from the law
 
04:17:17.210 --> 04:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
you put this language in does it change
 
04:17:19.130 --> 04:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
anything from the old
 
04:17:22.490 --> 04:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
bill or the Old Law I don't really know
 
04:17:24.530 --> 04:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
how to answer that other than to say
 
04:17:27.889 --> 04:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
that the definitions are different the
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
definitions are meant to be
 
04:17:34.610 --> 04:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
more instructive than than
 
04:17:34.620 --> 04:17:35.510 align:start position:0%
more instructive than than
um

04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:38.090 --> 04:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
leading you to have to look up another
 
04:17:40.010 --> 04:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
phrase somewhere else
 
04:17:40.020 --> 04:17:41.090 align:start position:0%
phrase somewhere else
um

04:17:41.090 --> 04:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:43.130 --> 04:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:17:44.809 --> 04:17:44.819 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:17:48.889 --> 04:17:48.899 align:start position:0%
the ultimate outcome recusal is
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
different than what is in the current
 
04:17:54.590 --> 04:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
law so in the current law
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
you need to have a benefit of financial
 
04:18:01.010 --> 04:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
benefit that is
 
04:18:04.610 --> 04:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
um at least great that is greater than
 
04:18:07.969 --> 04:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
anyone else in your position
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
in here
 
04:18:13.389 --> 04:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
um the benefits just has to be a benefit
 
04:18:17.150 --> 04:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
so that's one thing I'm sure when we go
 
04:18:19.010 --> 04:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
through a work session we'll we'll
 
04:18:21.349 --> 04:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
enumerate each one of those kind of
 
04:18:22.969 --> 04:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
things but I think that's what you're
 
04:18:27.469 --> 04:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
getting to yeah all right thank you yep
 
04:18:30.530 --> 04:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
or any other questions
 
04:18:34.849 --> 04:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
you're kidding okay you got off easy I
 
04:18:37.969 --> 04:18:37.979 align:start position:0%
guess and um we don't have any more
 
04:18:40.750 --> 04:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
testimony so it is
 
04:18:45.170 --> 04:18:45.180 align:start position:0%
117 and I'm now closing can I make one
 
04:18:48.590 --> 04:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
other quick statement here so
 
04:18:50.809 --> 04:18:50.819 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
04:18:53.750 --> 04:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is just the beginning as I said I
 
04:18:57.530 --> 04:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
it is I I someone asked me
 
04:19:00.410 --> 04:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
um earlier why this only shows
 
04:19:03.650 --> 04:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
Republicans in the sponsoring section
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
and and I wanted to explain that
 
04:19:10.370 --> 04:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
um so when we held a
 
04:19:13.610 --> 04:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
a session over the summer to to work it
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
was held as interim study so we studied
 
04:19:16.560 --> 04:19:17.570 align:start position:0%
was held as interim study so we studied
it

04:19:17.570 --> 04:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:19:17.580 --> 04:19:18.229 align:start position:0%
it
um

04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:20.150 --> 04:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
only Republicans showed up for that
 
04:19:22.250 --> 04:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
interim study by the way
 
04:19:26.030 --> 04:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
um but when we did the work on this and
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
and discussed it
 
04:19:30.769 --> 04:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
um over the summer
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
into the fall
 
04:19:35.870 --> 04:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
it came clear to me that we would
 
04:19:38.689 --> 04:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
ultimately end up with some kind of a
 
04:19:41.090 --> 04:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
compromise in here or or a committee
 
04:19:45.110 --> 04:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment so I didn't really wind up
 
04:19:48.110 --> 04:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
um trying to make sure that this bill
 
04:19:50.570 --> 04:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
was balanced because I felt that the
 
04:19:52.250 --> 04:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
amendment that we come out as a
 
04:19:55.309 --> 04:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
committee will be balanced so that's
 
04:19:58.370 --> 04:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
that was the answer for that
 
04:20:01.010 --> 04:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
um I can't think of anything else that
 
04:20:01.020 --> 04:20:02.389 align:start position:0%
um I can't think of anything else that
is

04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:20:04.969 --> 04:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
necessary to bring up in this activity
 
04:20:08.750 --> 04:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
the timeline here
 
04:20:10.189 --> 04:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
um from my standpoint I think I
 
04:20:12.050 --> 04:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned this to some people that were
 
04:20:14.269 --> 04:20:14.279 align:start position:0%
here early enough this morning
 
04:20:16.189 --> 04:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
is that I think we will have a works
 
04:20:17.750 --> 04:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
well maybe I should talk from the chair
 
04:20:20.210 --> 04:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
on this but I think there will be at
 
04:20:22.250 --> 04:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
least one other work session that we
 
04:20:25.189 --> 04:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
will have here and one of them I'm
 
04:20:27.950 --> 04:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
hoping is after the Ethics Committee
 
04:20:32.210 --> 04:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
itself weighs in and and tells whether
 
04:20:34.309 --> 04:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
this is something that they can work
 
04:20:37.729 --> 04:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
with and or if they provide guidance
 
04:20:40.130 --> 04:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
from from this they're actually the ones
 
04:20:41.389 --> 04:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
that are going to have to deal with this
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that's important
 
04:20:49.010 --> 04:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
good okay thank you thank you is 120 and
 
04:20:59.870 --> 04:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:59.880 --> 04:21:33.950 align:start position:0%
 
00

04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:36.769 --> 04:21:36.779 align:start position:0%
he runs off
 
04:21:36.779 --> 04:21:37.729 align:start position:0%
he runs off
um

04:21:37.729 --> 04:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:39.830 --> 04:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
I wanted I think I had told everybody
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
why we were meeting on Mondays but I
 
04:21:44.450 --> 04:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that
 
04:21:46.490 --> 04:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
if there was a conflict or if there was
 
04:21:48.349 --> 04:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
a problem with any of that
 
04:21:51.290 --> 04:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
to let uh either Vanessa or I know um
 
04:21:53.090 --> 04:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
that would be good
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
um can you shut off that microphone for
 
04:21:58.010 --> 04:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
right front here thanks
 
04:21:58.020 --> 04:21:58.790 align:start position:0%
right front here thanks
um

04:21:58.790 --> 04:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:03.110 --> 04:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
but we are planning to clean up
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
our bills next week the one thing that I
 
04:22:10.490 --> 04:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
didn't discuss earlier was if there are
 
04:22:12.650 --> 04:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
amendments that anyone is bringing on
 
04:22:14.929 --> 04:22:14.939 align:start position:0%
any of these bills
 
04:22:17.210 --> 04:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
um it's courtesy and I would appreciate
 
04:22:18.889 --> 04:22:18.899 align:start position:0%
if you would let us know that you're
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
bringing forth amendments that would be
 
04:22:21.600 --> 04:22:22.849 align:start position:0%
bringing forth amendments that would be
good

04:22:22.849 --> 04:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:22:26.570 --> 04:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
um so that covers all of the other bills
 
04:22:28.670 --> 04:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
rather than the one that I was just
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:22:33.110 --> 04:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
um Mr Lambert anything you want to add
 
04:22:41.389 --> 04:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:43.610 --> 04:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
04:22:45.889 --> 04:22:45.899 align:start position:0%
anything else anyone has for concerns
 
04:22:49.729 --> 04:22:49.739 align:start position:0%
comments questions before we yep
 
04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I just want to
 
04:22:54.650 --> 04:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
reiterate one of the biggest differences
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
between current law and what you're
 
04:23:00.590 --> 04:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
proposing is that current law
 
04:23:03.790 --> 04:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
mainly deals with financial interests
 
04:23:08.510 --> 04:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
this is this language or this measure
 
04:23:11.389 --> 04:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
we'll look at
 
04:23:15.050 --> 04:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
advocation or advocacy as
 
04:23:17.090 --> 04:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
a potential
 
04:23:17.100 --> 04:23:19.550 align:start position:0%
a potential
conflict

04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
04:23:19.560 --> 04:23:22.429 align:start position:0%
conflict
right

04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:24.170 --> 04:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
that may be something that we talk about
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
in the work session
 
04:23:26.399 --> 04:23:27.349 align:start position:0%
in the work session
um

04:23:27.349 --> 04:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:30.790 --> 04:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
I think it is I think it is in there but
 
04:23:34.130 --> 04:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
we have always had
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
a conflict when you work for or if
 
04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
you're on the board or something
 
04:23:38.880 --> 04:23:39.410 align:start position:0%
you're on the board or something
um

04:23:39.410 --> 04:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:42.050 --> 04:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
with fiduciary responsibility
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
so but we've closed the hearing so I
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
don't really want to go beyond that
 
04:23:46.680 --> 04:23:51.590 align:start position:0%
don't really want to go beyond that
thanks

04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:53.809 --> 04:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
if people want to hang on for a second
 
04:23:55.490 --> 04:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
too we have
 
04:23:55.500 --> 04:23:56.510 align:start position:0%
too we have
um

04:23:56.510 --> 04:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
we have just a little gift for our
 
04:24:02.689 --> 04:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
committee assistant that is retiring so
 
04:24:04.729 --> 04:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
there's a signature coming around on the
 
04:24:04.739 --> 04:24:06.229 align:start position:0%
there's a signature coming around on the
card

04:24:06.229 --> 04:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
card
 
04:24:06.239 --> 04:24:06.769 align:start position:0%
card
um

04:24:06.769 --> 04:24:06.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:09.170 --> 04:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
so it'd be nice if
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
we all just didn't toss the package to
 
04:24:14.269 --> 04:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
her and then ran out the door so
 
04:24:14.279 --> 04:24:16.699 align:start position:0%
her and then ran out the door so
yep
