00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
opening the executive session now on
 
00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
House Bill 185 relative to the
 
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
determination of parental rights and
 
00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 align:start position:0%
responsibilities based on shared
 
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
parenting and shared access to the
 
00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 align:start position:0%
child's records
 
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of work has gone into this you
 
00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
should be getting amendments
 
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
758 coming around
 
00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 align:start position:0%
both ways
 
00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 align:start position:0%
and if you we run out of amendments
 
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
before we run out of people we probably
 
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
have the opposite problem so just make
 
00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative posts
 
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.930 align:start position:0%
representative posts
um

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
Bill and her Amendment she got all her
 
00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
many of her co-sponsors to sign on as
 
00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.270 align:start position:0%
many of her co-sponsors to sign on as
well

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 align:start position:0%
and when you have had a chance to read
 
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
it over this uh purports to solve the
 
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
problems that we saw with the original
 
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.050 align:start position:0%
problems that we saw with the original
um

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
Bill and some of the earlier amendments
 
00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.229 align:start position:0%
Bill and some of the earlier amendments
this

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
has been worked on quite extensively I
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
noticed my notes from the original
 
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 align:start position:0%
hearing I think
 
00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 align:start position:0%
representative post has tried to take
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
them into account and you can read it
 
00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.699 --> 00:06:14.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.580 --> 00:07:21.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
over here are there any other amendments
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:29.450 align:start position:0%
on this bill
um

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
I think so
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
is it possible we could compare or uh
 
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
you may if you wish yeah there's another
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
one that landed out or they've been
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
withdrawn uh that is to say I got a copy
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
but the sponsor did not wish to proceed
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
with it there is an amendment 712 also
 
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
by representative post there is an
 
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
amendment 551 also by representative
 
00:07:59.150 --> 00:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
post and she has uh wished that this is
 
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
her amendment to be considered okay
 
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
that's all I want to see is what's
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
what's being presented to the committee
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
so this is the total of what's being yes
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
there is no amendment to my knowledge
 
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
that comes from any other party okay
 
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.770 align:start position:0%
that comes from any other party okay
okay

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.330 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
I I have a question
 
00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:22.379 align:start position:0%
related to the amendment and it would be
 
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
a question for
 
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
Richard head
 
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
is that I'm just curious if it's a
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
factual question it is possible
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
consulate would you mind coming up
 
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:42.350 align:start position:0%
consulate would you mind coming up
I'm

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
you may State your question once he's
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
does that all the time good morning good
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
morning I'm just curious if joint
 
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
parenting schedule if that is a current
 
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
term in the family courts you're
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
referencing line five line five of the
 
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
amendment four so
 
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.170 align:start position:0%
amendment four so
um

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
we had referenced equal parenting time
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
that there was a new definition and now
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
we have joint parenting schedule in this
 
00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:15.829 align:start position:0%
we have joint parenting schedule in this
amendment

00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious in terms of the family
 
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
courts if that is language that
 
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
so RSA 461 a colon 1 which is
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
definitions has a definition of
 
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
parenting schedule and parenting
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
schedule means a schedule of when the
 
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:34.100 align:start position:0%
child is in the care of each parent
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
so I don't know that adding the word
 
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:40.220 align:start position:0%
joint changes that okay definition okay
 
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
good question thank you anyone else yes
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.290 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
um could you just repeat what you said
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
um what the definition was for parenting
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
time sure so parenting plan is defined
 
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
in RSA 461 A1 parenting plan I'm sorry
 
00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
parent what I read before was parenting
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
parenting schedule
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
um parent so parenting schedule which I
 
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
read before it means the schedule of
 
00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
which the child is in the care of each
 
00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:16.790 align:start position:0%
which the child is in the care of each
parent

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:19.019 align:start position:0%
and then parenting plan which I think
 
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
was your question means a written plan
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
describing each parent's rights and
 
00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:25.190 align:start position:0%
describing each parent's rights and
responsibilities

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.389 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
sure

00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the bill as amended
 
00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:35.339 align:start position:0%
before we entertain a motion
 
00:10:35.339 --> 00:10:38.630 align:start position:0%
before we entertain a motion
representative

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm sorry Mr head I I
 
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
I think he's good for several yay
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
thank you both
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
um I I have a question
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh concerning uh line six
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
of the amendment of the amendment it
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
says including overnights with the child
 
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
by both fit parents what determines fit
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
or is there a determination in 461
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what that means thank
 
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.650 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what that means thank
you

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
one more question please you may ask
 
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:20.220 align:start position:0%
another question
 
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:24.140 align:start position:0%
um on line eight it's uh it
 
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
continues from line seven UH
 
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
you give me one second
 
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
I think A2
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
describes it uh well A6
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
okay yeah a62
 
00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:04.430 align:start position:0%
okay yeah a62
um so

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
so let me go to a couple places
 
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
so RSA 461 A2 has a statement of purpose
 
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
um which has as part one e or because
 
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
children do best when both parents have
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
a stable and meaningful involvement in
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
their lives it's policy of the state
 
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
unless it is clearly shown in a
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
particular case it is detrimental to a
 
00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:32.339 align:start position:0%
child two and then it lists those things
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
that identify the the purpose that the
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
legislature has identified
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh consider both the best interest of
 
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
the child in light of the factors listed
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
in 461 A6 and the safety of the parties
 
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
in developing a a parenting plan and
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
then 461 A6 has the definition of uh of
 
00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:56.339 align:start position:0%
what best interest is
 
00:12:56.339 --> 00:12:57.290 align:start position:0%
what best interest is
um

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
and then in the section that you just
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
pointed to in the in the amendment would
 
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
add a new paragraph into A6 which is a
 
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
list of of
 
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:10.850 align:start position:0%
list of of
um

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
those factors which go into what is the
 
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child
 
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much it would not replace
 
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
the ones at present
 
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
as far as I can see I believe this is a
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
new paragraph that is lines 10
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
into the next page is all a new
 
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
paragraph it is an insertion after 1A so
 
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
I would say it keeps the rest in place
 
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
yes so we could then presume that the
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
court in making a determination of what
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
is best practices have has a definition
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
I I apologize I didn't understand that
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
question I didn't either okay
 
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.069 align:start position:0%
question I didn't either okay
um

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
when we read the phrase best practices
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's not just something floating
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
and the interests are best practice the
 
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
courts know what that means because it's
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
here in the law we the the courts would
 
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
apply the the definitions that have been
 
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
identified through this A6 and then as
 
00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
amended by
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
um by this new paragraph that's correct
 
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:26.339 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
chairman um I wanted to point out on
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
page two line 20
 
00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
um where it says limited to I believe
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's a typo it should be t-o and not
 
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.650 align:start position:0%
that's a typo it should be t-o and not
t-o-o

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
these things are cleaned up along the
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
way it does not okay I put this in any
 
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy okay uh when this is it goes to
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
enrolled builds they clean up the
 
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
grammar and any inadvertent false
 
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
references to the existing law
 
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.300 align:start position:0%

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative Seidel it's the first
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
hand I saw any further discussion
 
00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:39.949 align:start position:0%
hand I saw any further discussion
uh

00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond hi thank you I
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative post for
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
um really listening to the questions and
 
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
the discussion that we had at our last
 
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
hearing regarding this Bell because I
 
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
think that they went back and they
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
really looked at the previous Amendment
 
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
and the questions that the committee
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
asked and try to address quite a bit of
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
it and I appreciate how they have kind
 
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
of expanded on this to make it a lot
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
more understandable for the layperson
 
00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:16.019 align:start position:0%
having said that I categorically opposed
 
00:16:19.449 --> 00:16:19.459 align:start position:0%
this amendment for the following reasons
 
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
one the legal terms are a mess the
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
standard and family court is not clear
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
in convincing evidence that's a criminal
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
court statute so every other
 
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
um case that is heard in the Family
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
Division is a preponderance of the
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
evidence so to suddenly for parenting
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
time raise that bar to clear and
 
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
convincing is completely irrational I
 
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
just I don't understand the logic there
 
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:48.740 align:start position:0%
and they've used clear and convincing
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
multiple times the second issue I have
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
again is language the word fit parents
 
00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
that's not defined joint parenting
 
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
schedule is not again consistent with
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
current state law it should be parenting
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
plan on page one line 22 it says
 
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
um if one of the parents is convicted of
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
child abuse or neglect again that is a
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
criminal term it requires it
 
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
specifically refers to being convicted
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
in a criminal case
 
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
now is it in the best interests of
 
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
children that we only restrict people
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
from parenting time if they've been
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
convicted criminally or is it okay to
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
say listen if you have a finding of
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect under family court
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you shouldn't have unrestricted
 
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
parenting time so really I feel like
 
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
there was some effort but this really
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
needs a review by an attorney who's
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with Family Division and
 
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
familiar with the Rules of Evidence
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton
 
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I have an issue with line 20 on the
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
amendment uh where it says
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
so leading up to it
 
00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
um it's talking about the The Joint
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
parenting schedule
 
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
um but it's saying that
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
if one of the parents does not request
 
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
sole primary or joint responsibility for
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
the child reasons may include but are
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
not limited to one parent lives or works
 
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
out of town so what kind of radius are
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
we talking about here and just because
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
someone commutes to work doesn't mean
 
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
that they can't have joint parenting
 
00:18:36.529 --> 00:18:36.539 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not a reason to not do
 
00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
50 50 parenting you know unless
 
00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:42.299 align:start position:0%
unless out of work was like across the
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
country then that's one thing but if
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
we have a ton of people in Manchester
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
alone and Nashua as well they commute
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
into Boston that has nothing to do with
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
their ability to parent you know 50 50.
 
00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:00.539 align:start position:0%
so I have a major issue with that thank
 
00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:04.010 align:start position:0%
so I have a major issue with that thank
you

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
excuse me where were you where were you
 
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
reading yes uh hand representative
 
00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:09.299 align:start position:0%
Pickford oh what this one or that one
 
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
either one okay or both
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
I was in the amendment
 
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
um Point number I so it's two i b
 
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.750 align:start position:0%
um Point number I so it's two i b
three

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
line twenty yeah line 20 and onward like
 
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:35.220 align:start position:0%
yeah okay any further comments
 
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone thank you Mr
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
chairman the the way I'm reading line 20
 
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.150 align:start position:0%
chairman the the way I'm reading line 20
is

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
I think the the first few words are very
 
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
important it says if one of the parties
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
does not request Soul primary or joint
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility it's whether the parent
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
is requesting or not it's not that the
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
court is determining it's whether the
 
00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:09.059 align:start position:0%
parent is requesting
 
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
parents don't request joint for many
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
many reasons that's their prerogative I
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you uh representative
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
D Simone for for that interpretation I
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
um my concern is for the divorces that
 
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
are contentious what if the other party
 
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
says well they work out of town and
 
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
therefore I should have more parenting
 
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
time so whereas the person who's working
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
out of town might be like no we can do
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
joint parenting time and it should be
 
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.070 align:start position:0%
joint parenting time and it should be
fine

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
but if if the parties are contentious
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
among each other and one is trying to
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
weaponize it against the other
 
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.510 align:start position:0%
weaponize it against the other
um

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.010 align:start position:0%
um
then

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:57.299 align:start position:0%
the the judge would have to go back to
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
what is in the law and if this is
 
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:12.539 align:start position:0%
chairman so I think
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
I think that um you know we have a
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
tightrope in the state
 
00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:18.299 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
you're talking about divorce cases that
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
are often contested and whatnot I think
 
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
that on this something like this another
 
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
thing to think about that I don't think
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
was necessarily thought about in you
 
00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
know the perfect world where you have an
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
amicable divorce you're not going to
 
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
disagree about these kind of things
 
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
however even in that case you have hurt
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
feelings you have other things happening
 
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
if we go in saying okay we have joint
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
parenting that's the standard we're
 
00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
going to start with joint parenting
 
00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:45.659 align:start position:0%
you're actually asking one parent to say
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
oh actually I don't want joint parenting
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
or I don't want like I can't do this
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
particular and even though that seems
 
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
really benign
 
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
and I understand I respect why this was
 
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
all brought up because there are parents
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
who want their kids that cannot get
 
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
their kids and I think that that's
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
that's honorable I think that this is
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
not the way because I think we're then
 
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
asking good parents to even say why they
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
don't want joint custody and to say to
 
00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:12.059 align:start position:0%
your kid well we didn't do joint when
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
they come down the line why why am I not
 
00:22:15.649 --> 00:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
with you half the time well I had to say
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
because I have to work or we're putting
 
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
that burden of responsibility rather
 
00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:21.299 align:start position:0%
than letting a judge look at the
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
situation and say well this makes sense
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
right because we're asking we're saying
 
00:22:27.649 --> 00:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
going into this all right there's joint
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
now tell us why there's not joint
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
custody so I think that's just a further
 
00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
complication I need I think we need to
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative ball
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
um when I'm reading this what I'm what
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing is that we're trying to find
 
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
a starting point and that starting point
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
would be at 50 50. and then we move away
 
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
from 50 50 as the parents find necessary
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
or the court finds necessary it's just
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
saying that having one person say that
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
person can't do 50 50 Carrington can't
 
00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:06.419 align:start position:0%
be the only reason there's got to be
 
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
other things you can't just have an
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
accusation that we can't co-parent but
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
there's many reasons why parents would
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
step away that children would understand
 
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:16.850 align:start position:0%
it could be
um

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
military commitments it could be First
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
Responders it could be medical
 
00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:24.539 align:start position:0%
professions where they can't do 50 50 if
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
they're on call on the weekends it's
 
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for here is just an
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
even starting point and from there the
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
court and the parents can decide what is
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the best interest and I think it
 
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
allows parents to start
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
on a level ground and they need to put
 
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
their animosity away and they need to
 
00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
put their children's best interest first
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.870 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
yeah we certainly know what parents need
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
to do that doesn't always happen that's
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
why we're here
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
um I what I haven't found in here for
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
example I I would be one to say yeah I'm
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
not about to turn down joint
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
joint parenting that's going to be
 
00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:12.059 align:start position:0%
embarrassing for me and my to my child
 
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm I gotta get up at four in the
 
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
morning to go to work I'm going to drop
 
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
my uh child off at my brother's house
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
who by the way my ex-wife hates
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
um where did you know I I just think
 
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking for more conflict
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
here you know we're setting up something
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
that's going to create more conflict uh
 
00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
just the sole base of getting a starter
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
point for joint uh uh you know joint
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
parenting I you know again it's not
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
reviewed through the whole line it
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
certainly begins the process however I
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid of The Snowball Effect that
 
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
is going to happen when
 
00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.090 align:start position:0%
is going to happen when
um

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I'm taking a court because
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
I don't have joint parenting because I'm
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
dropping them dropping my child off at
 
00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:02.810 align:start position:0%
dropping them dropping my child off at
my

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:09.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing further the motion before
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
us first of all is on the amendment
 
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
I just want to comment I
 
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree with
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
representative long on the idea that
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
it's going to cause more uh Agony
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't I think it's going to be the
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
opposite as uh representative ball said
 
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
this is something that's needed to make
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
it clear that parents
 
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
are equal parents and that's where
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
they're starting from
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
and if they can't do it
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
that's fine or if they don't think they
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
should do it that's fine but if the
 
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
other parent wants to show and
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that that apparent
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do it there should be a a high
 
00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
bar to to say otherwise because this
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
really goes hand in hand I think
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
dovetails with the parenting plan
 
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
uh position we have
 
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:04.340 align:start position:0%
in 2005 when we we passed the comparable
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
parenting bill which is almost identical
 
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
to this bill we have before us it passed
 
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
14-0 from this committee the only thing
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
that held it up was the administrative
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
jump into the courts asked us not to go
 
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:21.260 align:start position:0%
forward with it yet because they were in
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
spending so much time re uh what do I
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
want to say reforming almost the courts
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh the family court system particularly
 
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
with the uh parenting plan but um it was
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
it was quite popular so it stalled only
 
00:26:39.649 --> 00:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
um when we when I looked at um Iowa back
 
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
in 2004 because this has been around a
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
long time uh I originally filed this
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
back in 2008 it was a favorite of mine
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I jumped in to say yeah
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'll uh go for it
 
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.529 align:start position:0%
I'll uh go for it
um

00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:54.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
anyway in Iowa if the Court denies a
 
00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
request for joint physical care the
 
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
determination shall be accompanied by
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
specific findings of fact
 
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
and conclusions of the law that the
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
awarding of joint physical care is not
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the child it's
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
something that's been gathering over
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
time and I think it really I think it
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
really works very well for society and
 
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
instead of we've been seeing so many
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
bills that just do a little incremental
 
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
things within the court this is
 
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
something that I think will help Society
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
a great deal
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
Mr Mr representative Raymond thank you
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I just want to be clear I
 
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
do not oppose the idea of having
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
um a neutral starting point for court
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
for parenting time I think that we can
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
all agree that courts should be neutral
 
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
going in there and they should look at
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
both parents on the same footing right
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
from the get-go and then let the
 
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
evidence come in my objection to both
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
this amendment and the original bill is
 
00:27:59.210 --> 00:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
the inconsistencies with the language
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
and the terminology for used in this for
 
00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:06.059 align:start position:0%
legal terms that are contrary to current
 
00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
standards in Family Division this bill
 
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
consistently uses terminology that is
 
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate for Criminal Courts not
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
Family Division and so to me I think
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's lazy because we've been over this
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
multiple times in this committee but
 
00:28:22.679 --> 00:28:24.289 align:start position:0%
multiple times in this committee but
also

00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:24.299 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
um I I just don't think it's in the best
 
00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:30.059 align:start position:0%
interests of children or or families in
 
00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:33.059 align:start position:0%
the state to start confusing different
 
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
standards of evidence between criminal
 
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
and civil courts so should the sponsors
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
at some point come back with language
 
00:28:45.409 --> 00:28:45.419 align:start position:0%
that matches what the standard of
 
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
evidence is in Family Division
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
anything else provided you're not
 
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
repeating what has been said we have a
 
00:29:00.169 --> 00:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
lot of bills to get through we've been
 
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
kicking this one around for about 25
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
minutes now if this is not if this is
 
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
something new put your hand up if not
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
give it a shot
 
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm one of the
 
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
sponsors to this the original bill and I
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
liked the original Bill to begin with
 
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.769 align:start position:0%
liked the original Bill to begin with
um

00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
I don't support this amendment first of
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
all like I don't know that I was
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
talked to about this amendment before it
 
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
came out this is my first time reading
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
it now
 
00:29:36.659 --> 00:29:37.730 align:start position:0%
it now
um

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
but also like I just I I have issues
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
that I already mentioned so I'm not
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
going to talk about again
 
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
um but I would
 
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
I would move maybe when we're done the
 
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:51.299 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment I would move to
 
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
maybe retain this so that we could keep
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
it you know and fix fix more issues
 
00:30:00.889 --> 00:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:03.059 align:start position:0%
I'm confused
 
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
if we have a motion before us first of
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
all on the amendment then on the bill is
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
amended if the bill is amended passes it
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
passes if it ties or therefore is
 
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
defeated we can entertain another amen
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
another motion
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
seeing I hope nothing further
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is on Amendment
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%

would I like most of the things in it
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
most of them I just would like to tweak
 
00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:42.059 align:start position:0%
it a little bit
 
00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:45.539 align:start position:0%
and then we can present a new
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
um a new Amendment I'm one of the
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
sponsors on this original bill so
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
obviously I liked it for for most of it
 
00:33:54.169 --> 00:33:54.179 align:start position:0%

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
representative post and and some of the
 
00:33:59.330 --> 00:33:59.340 align:start position:0%

and get my own input into this
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
um we can address the issues and maybe
 
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
we can bring it back like relatively
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%

it should be thank you very much
 
00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:57.349 align:start position:0%
it should be thank you very much
okay

00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
I have something to read before we go on
 
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
to the next one this comes from Paul
 
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
Smith Clerk of the house regarding
 
00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
if you're writing a committee report and
 
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
we do not need one on the previous bill
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's been retained but going forward if
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
we don't retain something in a committee
 
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
report or two needs to be written please
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
pay attention
 
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.370 align:start position:0%
pay attention
if

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
the bill we wrote voted on and you are
 
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
writing a report on
 
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
has an amendment it is such and such a
 
00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:34.220 align:start position:0%
bill as amended the report must State
 
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does
 
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.770 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does
okay

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.130 align:start position:0%
okay
secondly

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.849 --> 00:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
this is not a problem with some who
 
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
write half a page of report this is for
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
those who write one sentence or two and
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
he gave an example the committee does
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.650 align:start position:0%
 
why

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
because there is a gang out there he
 
00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
used to harder term uh of people who
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
love to pull things off consent and all
 
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
they need is half an excuse to do so so
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we write as
 
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
best to report as possible so should the
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
bill get pulled off consent there is
 
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
good reasoning behind how we voted as a
 
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
committee so be a little bit more
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
forthcoming those who write sparsely
 
00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
also in your reports do not say the
 
00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:41.339 align:start position:0%
Republicans voted this way and the
 
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
Democrats voted that way because
 
00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:44.870 align:start position:0%
Democrats voted that way because
sometimes

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:49.220 align:start position:0%
it's mixed on both sides but we do not
 
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
identify the party even if it's
 
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.690 align:start position:0%
identify the party even if it's
unanimous

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
unanimous
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
the reports simply explain why this
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
group or that group is for this or
 
00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:02.339 align:start position:0%
against it that's what we do we read a
 
00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:05.579 align:start position:0%
narrative and somebody from outside the
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
process might not necessarily be able to
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
guess which party did one and which
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
party did the other
 
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
also he said do not State something as a
 
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.650 align:start position:0%
also he said do not State something as a
fact

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
that is an opinion for example if this
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
bill passes
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
it will bankrupt the city of Atkinson
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's what you think
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
it may not and I would simply fight hard
 
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
with my colleague here if that ever took
 
00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
place just simply say we believe that
 
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
this would harm gopher tortoises or
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
something not it will uh you will have
 
00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
to consult other things for facts it is
 
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
also we are coming up on deadline
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%

ask for clarifications of fact and so on
 
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:54.740 align:start position:0%
so I have now fulfilled my
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%

opened the exact session on House Bill
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
583 which is relative to termination of
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
child support
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
and there is
 
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:27.900 align:start position:0%

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh sponsor believes that this cleans up
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
questions that we had during the
 
00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.370 align:start position:0%
questions that we had during the
original

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.690 align:start position:0%
original
hearing

and if you have another amendment to
 
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
this from representative Spillane toss
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
it out because he wants Amendment 714 to
 
00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative long so representative
 
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
slain doesn't present an amendment to
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
the committee one of us Committee Member

00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
you may remember from the original
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
hearing there was a question about uh
 
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
somebody turning a certain age and
 
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
hadn't finished school yet and so he
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
taught it around and talked to some
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
various people and
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment 714 is what you see before
 
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.490 align:start position:0%
the amendment 714 is what you see before
you

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
again we now look at the other
 
00:42:48.119 --> 00:42:50.030 align:start position:0%
again we now look at the other
amendments

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
if they're by him
 
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to present any of them if
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
they're by him this is his Amendment but
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
are there any others that have been
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee I don't know
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
of any amendments that have been
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
presented to this committee on this I
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
thought representative ball had one
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
coming uh if she does maybe that's what
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
she's going to get I wasn't quite able
 
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
to hear what she was talking about okay
 
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
I just want to do a comparison of the
 
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
amendment you can do that that are being
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair that's exactly
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
what she went to do is pick up another
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
ing right

for uh reminding me there was another
 
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
amendment coming I'm afraid I dropped
 
00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
the ball on that
 
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
my pleasure to remind you
 
00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:54.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
so we have side by side by side and just
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
a reminder of anyone leaving the room
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
oh you get to look at the bill
 
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
representative Spillane's Amendment and
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
representative Ball's Amendment
 
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
okay chair calls on himself
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
um I like on the ball Amendment lines 15
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
and 16 because in my understanding age
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
21 is valid for most of the folks but if
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
there's a approved state board of
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
education program that goes stage 22. I
 
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:36.140 align:start position:0%
think I remember that uh representative
 
00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:36.829 align:start position:0%
think I remember that uh representative
[Music]

00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:36.839 --> 00:47:37.630 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh from my work with the DD Community
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's 22. so I think representative
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
ball certainly on lines 15 and 16 uh is
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
a more accurate rendering of what we
 
00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
wish to do any other comments we should
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
have representative ball speak to her
 
00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative spall in ball
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
May indeed speak to her Amendment
 
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
um when I did this amendment I did some
 
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
research on the social security for
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
children that were receiving
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
benefits survivor benefits and this
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
wording is taken right from there so it
 
00:48:19.849 --> 00:48:19.859 align:start position:0%
aligns with the same way the government
 
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
decides when to terminate
 
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
um child support and on the bottom again
 
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
I looked at both the
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
Board of Education with our extension of
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
allowing children to now stay in their
 
00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:37.700 align:start position:0%
special education programs till age 22
 
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
and I also looked at again Social
 
00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.190 align:start position:0%
and I also looked at again Social
Security

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
Security
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
requirements and that's where the
 
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond's hand thank you
 
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
I this is this the sweet spot where I
 
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
should put it from now on uh we'll see
 
00:48:58.510 --> 00:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
one can hope okay
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
but to a point I just wanted to thank
 
00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
representative ball for um the work that
 
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:05.099 align:start position:0%
she did on this I know
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Greg also had
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
looked that up and sent it to
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
representative splane and when I was
 
00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:11.579 align:start position:0%
reviewing this one
 
00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
um over the weekend
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
um I was like oh we're still missing
 
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
that language about
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
um kids who are in programs until 22. so
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
um you have resolved my biggest issue
 
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that
 
00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
I know it's a lot of work to get this
 
00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
done and in so quickly
 
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
yes I do have a question
 
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.349 align:start position:0%
yes I do have a question
um

00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
it this uh programs that it would
 
00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.309 align:start position:0%
it this uh programs that it would
include

00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
um for example
 
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
um when I back in the days when I moved
 
00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:42.589 align:start position:0%
um when I back in the days when I moved
here

00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
um they make me go back and then did
 
00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:46.609 align:start position:0%
um they make me go back and then did
some

00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
um go back into high school
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
um and so when I graduated I was like
 
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
already past the uh 18 because you know
 
00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
they got English or the second language
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
at this amendment would include those
 
00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:03.020 align:start position:0%
students that they come in with the
 
00:50:05.329 --> 00:50:05.339 align:start position:0%
programs with like English as a second
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
language sometime we have to go back and
 
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
then take extract classes so we have to
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
go back couple grades because the
 
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
education for another country it doesn't
 
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
no go ahead
 
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
I believe that it it closes the mic
 
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you um
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
I believe that it does cover it because
 
00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:32.060 align:start position:0%
it would be under the special education
 
00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
that you're continuing continuing your
 
00:50:37.609 --> 00:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
education in an edu special education
 
00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
program and it does go to give that
 
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
extra year of children who may have been
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
retained a year or need an additional
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
year in high school so they don't
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
graduate until they're 19. so it does go
 
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh till 19 and two months if you're not
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
in special education there's also the
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
provision that says that the judge can
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
also say it's going to go beyond age 18
 
00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:02.579 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
and I would also like to mention that in
 
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
2021 there was a court case and the
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
determination was that Home Care
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
Services continue for children that are
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
enrolled special education children
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
disabled children who are enrolled in um
 
00:51:24.049 --> 00:51:24.059 align:start position:0%
home services and extra Services they
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
don't lose that because they're a
 
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:33.300 align:start position:0%

Representatives do you have any
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
objection to going on to consent you
 
00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
shouldn't I have a question
 
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
how do we handle the spleen Amendment
 
00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
now which is active in them it was not
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
received and entered in
 
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.589 align:start position:0%
received and entered in
oh

00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
unless somebody chooses to present it
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
from the community okay it is a dead
 
00:55:57.599 --> 00:55:58.970 align:start position:0%
from the community okay it is a dead
Amendment

00:55:58.970 --> 00:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:02.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:04.849 --> 00:56:04.859 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman
 
00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to put it on consent but it
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
has a fiscal note attached
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
I do not believe it is a second
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee Bill and let's take a look at
 
00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note from the original
 
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
bill it says at least my copy says
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
due to time constraints they didn't give
 
00:56:29.339 --> 00:56:30.589 align:start position:0%
due to time constraints they didn't give
one

00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
so therefore we can send it over and if
 
00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
the clerk says we're wrong he can bump
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
it along its happy way not for us to
 
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
representative ball would you write a
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
very wonderful committee report for us
 
00:57:06.049 --> 00:57:06.059 align:start position:0%
please thank you
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
and this concludes uh the exact session
 
00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:29.220 align:start position:0%
and let's see what do we have next here
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
all right the next thing that was given
 
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:33.020 align:start position:0%
to me is
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
548 opened the executive session on
 
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:39.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:40.990 align:start position:0%
House Bill
548

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
548
 
00:57:45.049 --> 00:57:45.059 align:start position:0%
and this is an amendment that the
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative spelane asks me
 
00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:54.059 align:start position:0%
to present and it is amendment 617.
 
00:57:54.059 --> 00:58:01.210 align:start position:0%
to present and it is amendment 617.
foreign

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:01.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
and this was basically you'll remember a
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
patch job
 
00:58:15.599 --> 00:58:16.609 align:start position:0%
patch job
um

00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
the lines five and six on the original
 
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
Bill had a strikeout through the words
 
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
and has obtained or maintained health
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage as required by a
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
legal order of support that was not
 
00:58:34.089 --> 00:58:34.099 align:start position:0%
requested by the prime sponsor it was
 
00:58:34.099 --> 00:58:35.770 align:start position:0%
requested by the prime sponsor it was
stricken

00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:35.780 align:start position:0%
stricken
 
00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:41.540 align:start position:0%
erroneously and my Amendment 617 simply
 
00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
restores the words that never should
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
have been taken out
 
00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:50.819 align:start position:0%
so what you get in the amendment 617h is
 
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
the bill as the prime sponsor wished it
 
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
to appear and you may remember from the
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
hearing that was about the only
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.119 --> 01:00:04.130 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
you may remember the reason for the bill
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
was if somebody has
 
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
um let's say a fifty thousand dollar
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
salary and it's divided among a number
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
of pay periods sometimes the check might
 
01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
499.98 and
 
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
that technically puts you in default of
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
if you're supposed to be giving 500
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
you're in default by two cents and the
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
computers do not understand that
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
apparently and as a result some people
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
have been penalized for being in arrears
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
when it's two cents so what the
 
01:00:43.609 --> 01:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
sponsor's bill would seek to do is
 
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
simply bump it up to twenty five dollars
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
where this kind of error which
 
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
apparently has happened to some people
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh shouldn't happen that's what this
 
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:02.930 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands up the chair then wishes
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
on house on the amendment zero six one
 
01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
seven h
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
were you waving for second end
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.309 align:start position:0%
what's that
okay

01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
does it I do have a question a
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you Mr uh
 
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
25 is the
 
01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.390 align:start position:0%
25 is the
minimum

01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
child support pay
 
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
is that what that is
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
no I don't think so it's not is there
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
might be is there a minimum
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
we know the Mr head no attorney had do
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
you know if there's a minimum child
 
01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
so 25 would be considerably under that
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and it's primarily for those
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
rounding errors of dividing something by
 
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I brought up that uh excuse me
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I brought that
 
01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
up at the hearing whether this should be
 
01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars or not because of that
 
01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.569 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars or not because of that
reason

01:03:17.569 --> 01:03:17.579 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
but you say it's
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
if it's based on artificial intelligence
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to correct then I
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
guess it doesn't matter
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
too much but we can always get a another
 
01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:29.150 align:start position:0%
too much but we can always get a another
amendment

01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:03:31.569 --> 01:03:31.579 align:start position:0%
won't take long for them to do that well
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
I don't think he's interested in the
 
01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
minimum payment of Child Support he is
 
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
interested in being not burned anymore
 
01:03:41.329 --> 01:03:41.339 align:start position:0%
when something's off by two or three
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
cents anything I'm thinking of
 
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
Representative long
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
question representative long
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:03:51.049 --> 01:03:51.059 align:start position:0%
yeah this is in regard to the passport
 
01:03:51.059 --> 01:03:52.069 align:start position:0%
yeah this is in regard to the passport
issue

01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
I think so yeah in my understanding is
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
that it's a 2500 arrearage that
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
the feds
 
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.049 align:start position:0%
the feds
um

01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:00.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
Implement that on your passport
 
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.829 align:start position:0%
Implement that on your passport
so

01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
but we were told that it was like four
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
dollars and something cents
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
so I I don't understand I I get the need
 
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
from what I heard the sponsor telling us
 
01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
unfortunately he is cheering fish and
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
game at the moment and cannot be
 
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
with US Representative desamoni
 
01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:33.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman the issue was the
 
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
4.89 or something like that
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
the what happened was
 
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
the feds contact
 
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
when when they need to know whether a
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
person is in a rearage
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
and when the feds in that case did the
 
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh DHHS did not disclose the amount they
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
just said he was in arrears
 
01:05:08.569 --> 01:05:08.579 align:start position:0%
period end and they did not disclose the
 
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
amount that he was in arrears that's
 
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
what happens all too frequently I I
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
agree with you about the twenty five
 
01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars but that's not what
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
happened in this case and it's happened
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
in other cases he seems to be addressing
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
one problem not another in this
 
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
and therefore not to be penalized for
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
not doing something that another bill
 
01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
could have done
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
so anything further representative long
 
01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
that's not so so this bill does nothing
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
to the issue that he had with the fit
 
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
because the feds aren't listening to our
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
25 or or
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know it could still happen if
 
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
nobody's given them the amount
 
01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone for an answer
 
01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
thank you but in this case the DHHS
 
01:05:57.049 --> 01:05:57.059 align:start position:0%
would not be able to report that he was
 
01:06:00.849 --> 01:06:00.859 align:start position:0%
in a marriages if it is less than the 25
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to tell the feds
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes he's in arrears they would have to
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
representative Greg this is where her
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
daughter pays attention
 
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
um I would like to get actually Claire
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
can we get clarification I know the
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
people that work with child support
 
01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
services are here can we get
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
clarification on at what point they
 
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
would say because I believe it's higher
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
than four dollars and I did read the
 
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
federal statutes on that passport it
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
does not kick in until 2500 can we get
 
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
clarification from them please
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
is there anyone from Child Support
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
Services that can answer specifically
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
this point I think we're making this
 
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
more difficult than it is but let's
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
um and thank you representative Greg my
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
name is Lisa dakitowski Bureau of Child
 
01:07:01.849 --> 01:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
Support Services Department of Health
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
and Human Services bureau chief
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
attorney Matthew Hayes staff attorney
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
for Bureau of Child Support
 
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
um if I understand the the question
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
correctly uh the question is uh what is
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
the exact amount of arrearages that the
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
federal offset program for passport
 
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.410 align:start position:0%
federal offset program for passport
denial

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:23.420 align:start position:0%
denial
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
criteria is the Bureau the Federal
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
Regulation is that when an uh or on a
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
rearage balance
 
01:07:36.609 --> 01:07:36.619 align:start position:0%
is twenty five hundred dollars or more
 
01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
does the uh
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
a rearage balance gets reported to the
 
01:07:47.089 --> 01:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
federal offset program if all criteria
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
so on that basis it would seem that this
 
01:07:57.770 --> 01:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
bill may be addressing another issue and
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps yes Mr chairman
 
01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
so if I I just want to make sure I
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
understand so if they're twenty five
 
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars that's when the federal
 
01:08:15.529 --> 01:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
program kicks in to say the passport
 
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:18.299 align:start position:0%
can't happen however is there and that's
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
the state reporting to the federal
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
government correct that is correct that
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
is the requirement so is there a point
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
where the federal government like calls
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
and says like is there in a rearage and
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
you would say it's just a yes or no it's
 
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
not like oh it's four dollars or it's
 
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Greg for
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
that question in the event that an
 
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
obligor may have applied to have their
 
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
passport perhaps renewed or requested
 
01:08:51.970 --> 01:08:51.980 align:start position:0%
for a new passport to be issued to them
 
01:08:56.769 --> 01:08:56.779 align:start position:0%
if there is a indication on the federal
 
01:08:59.570 --> 01:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
passport side that there may have been
 
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
in a rearage reported they may reach out
 
01:09:05.209 --> 01:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
to the department to clarify whether the
 
01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
case is or whether that a rearage is
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
still active and still eligible for the
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
yeah representative long thank you Miss
 
01:09:21.769 --> 01:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
chairman so
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
is there a time when you would tell
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
anybody even within the state somebody
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
going for their license a yes or no
 
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
without an amount
 
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
for example if this bill were to pass if
 
01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
it was 24 you would have to say no
 
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:48.900 align:start position:0%
question I I appreciate that
 
01:09:50.209 --> 01:09:50.219 align:start position:0%
um let me just look at the amendment
 
01:09:50.219 --> 01:10:07.729 align:start position:0%
um let me just look at the amendment
again

01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
well that's my understanding um that
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
this compli whether or not I don't know
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
I don't have never personally answered
 
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
that question I'm not I'm not a
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
caseworker but I know that this statute
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
it seems like the theme of this
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
executive session is that the statute we
 
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
wouldn't answer that Federal uh that we
 
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't answer the federal entities
 
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
question by referencing the statute
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
most likely just give them near
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
rearrange and they would make their own
 
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
determination based on their own
 
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
regulations I don't think that we would
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
say uh somebody was in compliance or not
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
in compliance
 
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
in terms of this statute
 
01:10:50.290 --> 01:10:50.300 align:start position:0%
are you stating that your regulations
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
should this pass into law
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
I guess I just don't have enough
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
information on exactly what the sponsor
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
was looking to get from us
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
I'm really not going to the bill as much
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
you had said that if somebody asked you
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
you would make that determination on
 
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
your regulations and not on state law
 
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm challenging that statement
 
01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm not really sure what's being
 
01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:27.830 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm not really sure what's being
asked

01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
asked
 
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
I never I'm not sure what the specific
 
01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
issues that we're addressing I'm just
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know I can't speak to whether or
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
not we're giving a yes or no answer to
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
some federal entity that's reached out
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
to us on an individual case that's fine
 
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
I mean you don't have to have the answer
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
to our question I just
 
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
and if you don't that's fine unless
 
01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:49.930 align:start position:0%
and if you don't that's fine unless
um

01:11:49.930 --> 01:11:49.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
akitasking has something to offer about
 
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman what I would offer is
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
that the Social Security Act does
 
01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
require that states that are
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
administering the child support title 4D
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
program have within their state plan a
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
regular regulated provision uh in
 
01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
reference to the collection of past due
 
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
support from federal tax refunds so the
 
01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
title IV program uh does uh require that
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
states participate in that program
 
01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
through the administration of
 
01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
said program
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
all right does anybody remember why he
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
brought us this bill I mean the passport
 
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
2500 thing
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
seems to be a red herring and I have
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
terrible notes on this bill
 
01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative panicked you remember
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
what he's trying to say
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
representative speline was going to take
 
01:12:52.729 --> 01:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
a trip
 
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
he needed to submit for his passport
 
01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
yeah he was in the rears by one penny
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
right and because if he was in the Reyes
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
for one penny
 
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
his passport was denied because he was
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
yes or no in arrears by one cent
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's what he told that's what I
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
thought I remembered so I don't know
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
where this 2500 thing comes in then
 
01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone the 2500 comes
 
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
in to where the federal government will
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
as far as I I understand and they the 25
 
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars will at that point not
 
01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
only attacks your tax return but it will
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
deny a passport in this particular case
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
he did not reach the 2500 Mark so they
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
did not attach his
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
um tax return however they did refuse
 
01:13:59.090 --> 01:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
his passport okay which he had applied
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
for because he had to go to another
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh that was a demand on the employer's
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
part representative Perez yeah I do have
 
01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
a question because I believe I wasn't
 
01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
here for the hearing and so this bill
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
was introduced Because unless they
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
represented it had an issue with his
 
01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
passport or that something that happened
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
often in the like with our constituents
 
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
that's something that I you know I
 
01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't here so I don't know this is a
 
01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
personal issue and he introduced the
 
01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
bill this is something that really
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
happens all the time and and that's why
 
01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
we're doing we you know we introducing
 
01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
this bill to be honest I just want to be
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know when I'm voting for something
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
or when I'm I'm thinking about a bill I
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we're doing
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
because this is going to help our
 
01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.709 align:start position:0%
because this is going to help our
constituents

01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:14:59.890 --> 01:14:59.900 align:start position:0%
um no because you know it was affecting
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
one state representative
 
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
and and you know the personal matter
 
01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
that's all I I want to know because I I
 
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
wasn't here so thank you representative
 
01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.709 align:start position:0%
wasn't here so thank you representative
Grossman

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
Grossman
 
01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
I came in at the end of this day's
 
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
testimony were there any other
 
01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
books that came forward with issues
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
related to this the clerk will be
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
checking on that and if anyone else has
 
01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
a another comment or question while he's
 
01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
um you can do it now representative D
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
Simone thank you Mr chair I I just
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
honestly find it very difficult to
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
01:15:44.209 --> 01:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
this is a one-person issue if it's
 
01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
happening to one person we don't know
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
how many other people that it's
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
happening to because not everybody
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
realizes that they can come to the
 
01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
legislature to get it fixed
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
um so I I personally find it difficult
 
01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
to believe that it's a one-person issue
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
I do remember at work I periodically
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
oversee my billing department and
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
um there was somebody whose wage wound
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
up being let's just pick an arbitrary
 
01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
number uh
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
699.99 and she trotted her check over to
 
01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
me and said I thought I got 700 and we
 
01:16:28.729 --> 01:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
had a good laugh on that and looked at
 
01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:30.980 align:start position:0%
it'll probably come out at
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
700.4 cents in a few months and we
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
laughed at that uh because she she
 
01:16:39.169 --> 01:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
thought it would be funny and it was and
 
01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
so it does happen but if there's
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
penalties saying you're under
 
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
699.99 technically I suppose means we
 
01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
underpaid her that month and don't tell
 
01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
anybody I just said that because we
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
don't do it now we made sure we don't do
 
01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
it now just in case but so yeah I would
 
01:16:58.570 --> 01:16:58.580 align:start position:0%
kind of think this would be the case
 
01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:00.290 align:start position:0%
kind of think this would be the case
representative

01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
um Perino
 
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
only representative Spillane spoke in
 
01:17:07.729 --> 01:17:07.739 align:start position:0%
support of the of his bill there was one
 
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
other individual who did speak but
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
testimony was irrelevant and one other
 
01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.330 align:start position:0%
testimony was irrelevant and one other
um

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
folks in front of us spoke in opposition
 
01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:19.610 align:start position:0%
folks in front of us spoke in opposition
okay

01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
I think my opinion is this may not
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
address other issues but it seems to
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
address this issue for one person in my
 
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
assumption it would be a few others too
 
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
and it isn't going to hurt anybody if we
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
pass it
 
01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:37.739 align:start position:0%

that there is a much bigger bill on
 
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
an aspect of this subject being
 
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
presented in Representatives Hall at
 
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
this moment and there will be all day
 
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
on two bills on this very subject I've
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
discussed this with a number not all but
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
a number of members of this committee
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
and my inclination is when it comes to
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
an executive session I will push for
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
retention because many of us were of the
 
01:28:58.729 --> 01:28:58.739 align:start position:0%
conclusion this is an evolving subject
 
01:29:02.209 --> 01:29:02.219 align:start position:0%
let my former Committee in reps Hall
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
have all the fun with this and we can
 
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
look at it later that's just me speaking
 
01:29:09.169 --> 01:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
but that's letting people at the outset
 
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
know where I would hope we will go down
 
01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
I've got a whole bunch of pink cards
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
and here's the rules of the road
 
01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
you get to speak for two minutes
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
two write it out ahead of time
 
01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
because at a minute and 45 I'm gonna go
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
like this and that means you have 15
 
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
the reason we do that is not to be mean
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
but to be fair
 
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
hearings with a lot of strong opinion
 
01:29:55.570 --> 01:29:55.580 align:start position:0%
and pink cards measured in inches
 
01:29:59.810 --> 01:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
that people have taken a day off to come
 
01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
and if it comes to five o'clock and
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
we're still on a subject and more than
 
01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
half of the committee has left
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's because somebody spoke for 15
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
minutes before you and before them and
 
01:30:14.090 --> 01:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
before them and before them
 
01:30:16.330 --> 01:30:16.340 align:start position:0%
and that means you who took a day off
 
01:30:18.890 --> 01:30:18.900 align:start position:0%
you'll speak to an almost empty room and
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
I don't want to do that that is not fair
 
01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
to you
 
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
so as a result irrespective of what
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
one's views are on any particular
 
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.729 align:start position:0%
one's views are on any particular
subject

01:30:28.729 --> 01:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
subject
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
we have adopted in the house this kind
 
01:30:40.129 --> 01:30:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
so you get two minutes
 
01:30:45.010 --> 01:30:45.020 align:start position:0%
if you have written copies
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
when your name is called please bring
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
the written copies to representative
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
Bickford and then he will pass them
 
01:30:57.169 --> 01:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
around and then go to your seat there's
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
a little button you push and when your
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
microphone and turns red that means your
 
01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
mic is on
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
so two minutes irrespective of what you
 
01:31:11.649 --> 01:31:11.659 align:start position:0%
wrote on the card it is a two-minute
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
speech Mr chairman yes
 
01:31:17.870 --> 01:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind can I just very
 
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
quickly say something yeah
 
01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
I would like to say thank you to
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
everyone who's here to SFI and and I'm
 
01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
hope and I'm hoping that everyone
 
01:31:31.729 --> 01:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
remember that we're talking about humans
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
and then we talking about a person and
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
then we all keep it respectfully
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
and up I believe humans deserve dignity
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
and respect and I hopefully we keep it
 
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%

01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%

sheet that I handed out it really points
 
01:32:38.689 --> 01:32:38.699 align:start position:0%

01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
um that not from the ACLU perspective
 
01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
but from the perspective of major public
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
health and medical associations this is
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
a dangerous Bill if you look in the
 
01:32:49.970 --> 01:32:49.980 align:start position:0%

concerns with any policy like this

I'm a father I'm politically independent
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
I'm a homeowner and I oppose this bill
 
01:33:59.090 --> 01:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
so many of the new and incumbent members
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
of this Governor body ran on a platform
 
01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
of parental rights
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
one of them who is my aunt let you know
 
01:34:08.570 --> 01:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
that everyone should be able to make
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
their own choices regarding medical
 
01:34:11.689 --> 01:34:11.699 align:start position:0%
decisions for themselves and their
 
01:34:11.699 --> 01:34:13.370 align:start position:0%
decisions for themselves and their
children

01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
this tiny little bill with a fiscal
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
impact Ledger larger than they changed
 
01:34:21.169 --> 01:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
the law itself is not doing that
 
01:34:22.729 --> 01:34:22.739 align:start position:0%
the way it's sold to the hard-working
 
01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
people of our state is that you're
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
protecting pre-adolescents from a
 
01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
radical agenda and irreversible
 
01:34:28.970 --> 01:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
surgeries it goes after medication
 
01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
Interventional therapy and is vague
 
01:34:33.290 --> 01:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
enough that every parent that is looking
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
to do what they can to even just to
 
01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
understand what their kid is going
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
through the mental health care can be
 
01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
we're told it's a major epidemic
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
here's some stats that I'm in clinical
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
research that I can give you based on
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
Reuters and Komodo Medical
 
01:34:52.370 --> 01:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
over five five year period there's only
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
been about 121 882 kids that are
 
01:34:57.770 --> 01:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with gender dysphoria
 
01:34:59.330 --> 01:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
that's Nationwide
 
01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
in that time less than 5 000 reported to
 
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.020 align:start position:0%

01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's only 282 instances of adolescent
 
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
surgery and the scary one that
 
01:35:14.330 --> 01:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
everybody's worried about the one below
 
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
the belt only 56 of any genital
 
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:18.780 align:start position:0%

under
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
I want to compare that to something that
 
01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
might be a little embarrassing for some
 
01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
of the gentlemen here in the state alone
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
eighty percent of people born
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
biologically male we all had

circumcision
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
we were babies
 
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
we didn't make this cultural and
 
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
religious Choice it didn't make us more
 
01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:37.729 align:start position:0%
religious Choice it didn't make us more
men

01:35:37.729 --> 01:35:37.739 align:start position:0%
men
 
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's a ridiculous idea
 
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
but my parents did it because they're
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
good folks it was with our cultural
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
ideas that were in mind and it was
 
01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:49.189 align:start position:0%
ideas that were in mind and it was
protected

01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
protected
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
but they also raised me to stand up to
 
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:52.860 align:start position:0%
the idea of pushy folks that think Live
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
Free or Die was expressing a preference
 
01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
for our neighbors who don't agree with
 
01:35:59.450 --> 01:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
us do the latter
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm just advising you as a taxpayer
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
and proper your own owner just keep
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
investigating this bill run from it it's
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
not too late to stand for the Liberty
 
01:36:09.649 --> 01:36:09.659 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to instill in our kids
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
would you take a question or two happily
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
I recall from testimony on some previous
 
01:36:20.159 --> 01:36:21.890 align:start position:0%
I recall from testimony on some previous
bills

01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
from folks who
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
often vote opposite to me sure the
 
01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:29.570 align:start position:0%
often vote opposite to me sure the
quotes

01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
quotes
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
I don't always trust children to make
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
the right decision for themselves and
 
01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
quote I don't always trust parents to
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
make the right decision for their
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
children and quote we need a village
 
01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
um how do you square those and that's an
 
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
honest question I like that I like that
 
01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:48.709 align:start position:0%
honest question I like that I like that
question

01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
and here's why
 
01:36:53.209 --> 01:36:53.219 align:start position:0%
I was
 
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not a Democrat
 
01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
for my folks they were basically
 
01:36:59.330 --> 01:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
squaring the idea of what they wanted to
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
do for vaccination for Mass mandates for
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
keeping our people free
 
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
if my kid's gonna mask they're gonna
 
01:37:07.729 --> 01:37:07.739 align:start position:0%
mask I'm not gonna make your kid I'm not
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
gonna make your kid do it it's
 
01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:11.030 align:start position:0%
gonna make your kid do it it's
ridiculous

01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
that said if I have multiple doctors a
 
01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
therapist and everyone else looking into
 
01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
what's going on with my child
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
and they're like this isn't a phase
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'm a skeptic I'll keep going
 
01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
as a parent you don't jump into things
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
carefully and you don't lazily just hope
 
01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think anyone doing this is like
 
01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
high-fiving and running their way to the
 
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question sir
 
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
very well thank you sir I appreciate
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%

01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
chairman Pierce members of the committee
 
01:39:20.689 --> 01:39:20.699 align:start position:0%
my name is Holly Stevens I'm the
 
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
director of public policy for Nami New
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'll try to keep this brief
 
01:39:25.729 --> 01:39:25.739 align:start position:0%
because there's a I know there's a lot
 
01:39:27.110 --> 01:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
of people behind me
 
01:39:29.090 --> 01:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
um who aren't wearing
 
01:39:32.110 --> 01:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
an orange badge who want to speak today
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
we know that right now we're we have a
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis with our youth we
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
know that our suicide rates are rising
 
01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.550 align:start position:0%
know that our suicide rates are rising
um

01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:53.110 --> 01:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
18.8 percent of New Hampshire High
 
01:39:56.930 --> 01:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
School students seriously considered
 
01:39:59.450 --> 01:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
suicide in 8.9 attempted that we know
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
that there's a small substitute subset
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
of that group of individuals who have
 
01:40:05.689 --> 01:40:05.699 align:start position:0%
even higher rates of suicide and that is
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq plus Community
 
01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
a bill like this only goes to disaffirm
 
01:40:19.250 --> 01:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
their own identity and and in a sense
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
attacks it and I do find it a little bit
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
ironic as you just heard and this will
 
01:40:25.810 --> 01:40:25.820 align:start position:0%
be my last point I think of the day
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
that there are two bills being heard
 
01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
today on parental rights
 
01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
and this bill would devoid parents of
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
their rights and as far as taking a
 
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
village I mean I think you heard that
 
01:40:39.649 --> 01:40:39.659 align:start position:0%
the villages the doctors the therapists
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
the parents the the Family Support
 
01:40:44.530 --> 01:40:44.540 align:start position:0%
around those kids
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need government interference
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
so Nami New Hampshire is in opposition
 
01:40:52.330 --> 01:40:52.340 align:start position:0%
to this Bill thank you
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%

decision it's not just a parent's
 
01:42:04.010 --> 01:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
decision there are multiple medical
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
providers who are also making these
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
decisions and we're all trained on this
 
01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:09.060 align:start position:0%

01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
new this is something that's support and
 
01:42:13.129 --> 01:42:13.139 align:start position:0%

01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
the literature on gender affirming care
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
it is very clear to me that gender
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
affirming care is not child abuse in
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
fact when considering the increased
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
risks of depression and suicide that
 
01:42:34.609 --> 01:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
come with denying gender affirming care
 
01:42:36.890 --> 01:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
it would appear that denying appropriate
 
01:42:39.410 --> 01:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care is child abuse
 
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you doctor and if you could
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
bring up your testimony to the clerk

01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:19.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
and I am a mother to two teenagers one
 
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
who is transgender
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
I am speaking today in opposition to
 
01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
hb417 to project my child my family
 
01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
and others like ours whose parental
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
rights will be taken away if this bill
 
01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
becomes law
 
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
his every parent's responsibility to
 
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
ensure that they do all they can to keep
 
01:43:58.609 --> 01:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
their child healthy in fact to ignore a
 
01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
health concern of your child is
 
01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
consistent considered neglect a form of
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
child abuse
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
if my child had cancer or diabetes or
 
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
bipolar disease the state of New
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would require and expect that
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
I make every effort to see that my child
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
received appropriate Medical Care
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
a transgender child who has been
 
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
clinically diagnosed by medical
 
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
professionals with gender dysphoria is
 
01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:27.719 align:start position:0%
no different than a kid with cancer or
 
01:44:32.689 --> 01:44:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
as a responsible parent
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law I am obliged to
 
01:44:39.649 --> 01:44:39.659 align:start position:0%

child
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
if this law were to pass the state of
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would require that my
 
01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
husband and myself deny our child the
 
01:44:50.090 --> 01:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
necessary medical care that has been
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
recommended To Us by board certified New

01:45:00.290 --> 01:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
therefore causing us to our neglect our

therefore causing us to our neglect our

child
 
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
this law proposes that a small number of
 
01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
politicians know more about taking care
 
01:45:10.490 --> 01:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
of my child than me my husband my
 
01:45:12.649 --> 01:45:12.659 align:start position:0%

01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
the government does not know what is
 
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
best for my child my husband and I do
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
would you criminalize a parent of a
 
01:45:34.129 --> 01:45:34.139 align:start position:0%
child with cancer because they chose a
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
medical treatment that a politician did
 
01:45:37.609 --> 01:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
not like
 
01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
the arrogance of this bill is astounding
 
01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:43.860 align:start position:0%
some politicians are putting a sick
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
Twist on this hateful Bill to say they
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
are proposing these laws to protect
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
innocent children
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
we all know this is a pack of Lies
 
01:45:54.729 --> 01:45:54.739 align:start position:0%
the true intent of this bill bills like
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
hb417 is to shame and scare transgender
 
01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
children and push them back into the
 
01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:02.629 align:start position:0%
children and push them back into the
closet

01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
closet
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
are you aware that transgender children
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
teenagers in particular have the highest
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
risk of suicide of all children 82
 
01:46:11.450 --> 01:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
percent of transgender teens have been
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
suicidal over 40 percent have attempted
 
01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
suicide you've got 15 seconds now the
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
statistic from this National Library of
 
01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:22.490 align:start position:0%
statistic from this National Library of
Medicine

01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
proposed laws like hb417 that are meant
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
to shame and scare transgender children
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
and their families will only cause more
 
01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
distress to an already very vulnerable
 
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
population of children this law
 
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
supposedly protects innocent children
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
Lives May in fact be the thing that
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
causes children to take their own and
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
now would you wish to hand that
 
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
testimony would you like us to have
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
copies of it okay if you could hand it
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
to the end please thank you so much the
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes Dr Jennifer Smith
 
01:46:56.330 --> 01:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
committee I do not have written
 
01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:02.030 align:start position:0%
committee I do not have written
testimony

01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:47:04.850 --> 01:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
um I want to strongly urge you to itl
 
01:47:07.850 --> 01:47:07.860 align:start position:0%
this bill the last time this I think
 
01:47:10.250 --> 01:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
identical text was heard in this
 
01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
committee it went to the floor 20-0 was
 
01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
supposed to be on consent calendar
 
01:47:17.689 --> 01:47:17.699 align:start position:0%
though it was pulled off
 
01:47:21.169 --> 01:47:21.179 align:start position:0%
and this is ridiculous how long will we
 
01:47:24.890 --> 01:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
have to continue to make the case that
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
this is care that is done carefully it
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
involves parents if there's going to be
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
any unless there's a appointed Guardian
 
01:47:36.530 --> 01:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
for someone who has had to flee their
 
01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:37.729 align:start position:0%
for someone who has had to flee their
parents

01:47:37.729 --> 01:47:37.739 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
and it it does not make any sense
 
01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
that one would call this child abuse not
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
only am I transgender I have extended
 
01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
family members in the generation that
 
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
this would affect who are also
 
01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:54.649 align:start position:0%
this would affect who are also
transgender

01:47:54.649 --> 01:47:54.659 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
01:47:56.689 --> 01:47:56.699 align:start position:0%
thank God their parents are very
 
01:47:58.850 --> 01:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
supportive of them as are the rest of
 
01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
their Community their parents have
 
01:48:03.470 --> 01:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
gathered and yes everything takes a
 
01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.850 align:start position:0%
gathered and yes everything takes a
community

01:48:04.850 --> 01:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
people who live in communities that are
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
abusive need to be held to account our
 
01:48:13.370 --> 01:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
community among people who are
 
01:48:16.129 --> 01:48:16.139 align:start position:0%

we listen to others
 
01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
and we help people make the decisions
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
that are very hard to make and 15

01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
Region and I currently live in
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester with my spouse
 
01:49:47.330 --> 01:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
um and I run a group practice of 25
 
01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:49.010 align:start position:0%
um and I run a group practice of 25
clinicians

01:49:49.010 --> 01:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
clinicians
 
01:49:51.229 --> 01:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
I write to you today appalled by the
 
01:49:55.970 --> 01:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
very idea of hb417 and anybody who works
 
01:49:57.530 --> 01:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh to protect children in the state
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
should be as well in my opinion
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
I find fault with several points in this
 
01:50:03.050 --> 01:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
bill and I will outline them quickly for
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
you here
 
01:50:06.770 --> 01:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
so the process that any person has to go
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
through including minors to obtain any
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
kind of gender confirming care is
 
01:50:11.639 --> 01:50:12.830 align:start position:0%
kind of gender confirming care is
extensive

01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
01:50:14.810 --> 01:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
it starts with somebody's primary care
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
provider but then they have to get
 
01:50:17.810 --> 01:50:17.820 align:start position:0%
hooked up with mental health clinicians
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
and then an endocrinologist and there
 
01:50:21.410 --> 01:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
have to be letters written this is an
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
intentional process and it's
 
01:50:23.159 --> 01:50:24.890 align:start position:0%
intentional process and it's
evidence-based

01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
and somebody doesn't just wake up one
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
day and decide that they're trans and
 
01:50:31.850 --> 01:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
then poof they get all the medical care
 
01:50:33.649 --> 01:50:33.659 align:start position:0%
that they need that's necessary that's
 
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
not how this works
 
01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.189 align:start position:0%
not how this works
um

01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
but even going through the
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
evidence-based process there are still
 
01:50:42.649 --> 01:50:42.659 align:start position:0%
many providers who will not provide
 
01:50:44.570 --> 01:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
gender confirming care
 
01:50:46.570 --> 01:50:46.580 align:start position:0%
a child who approaches their caregiver
 
01:50:49.490 --> 01:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
requesting these Services sets in motion
 
01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
a chain of events involving all the
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
things that I just
 
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
um talked about
 
01:50:57.229 --> 01:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
and it has to start with consent of the
 
01:50:59.629 --> 01:50:59.639 align:start position:0%
caregivers the caregiver has to be given
 
01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
the autonomy to be able to consent to
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
um to assume that children would be
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
subjected to this is false and it's also
 
01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:13.010 align:start position:0%
subjected to this is false and it's also
discriminatory

01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
also statistically providing gender
 
01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
affirming care as some of my colleagues
 
01:51:19.609 --> 01:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
have stated up here already can
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
literally save the lives of those who
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
receive it
 
01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
suicide is the second leading cause of
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
death in people ages 13 to 24 in the
 
01:51:29.770 --> 01:51:29.780 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
01:51:32.689 --> 01:51:32.699 align:start position:0%
lgbtqia plus youth are four times more
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
likely to attempt suicide than their
 
01:51:34.679 --> 01:51:36.050 align:start position:0%
likely to attempt suicide than their
peers

01:51:36.050 --> 01:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
peers
 
01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:38.820 align:start position:0%
there's a suicide attempt of an lgbtqia
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
plus youth approximately every 45
 
01:51:41.159 --> 01:51:44.689 align:start position:0%
plus youth approximately every 45
seconds

01:51:44.689 --> 01:51:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.050 --> 01:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
45 of lgbtqia Youth have seriously
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
considered attempting suicide in the
 
01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
past year and more than half of them
 
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
transgender or non-binary
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
that statistic Rises sharply with
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
lgbtqia plus youth who live in homes
 
01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
where they do not feel supported by
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
their caregivers and their families
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
next I want to talk about enforceability
 
01:52:07.129 --> 01:52:07.139 align:start position:0%
as a clinical mental health counselor
 
01:52:09.050 --> 01:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
who works primarily with kids
 
01:52:12.109 --> 01:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
I interface with dcyf consistently
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
you have about 20 seconds okay
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
um dtyf has a difficult job to be sure
 
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
um and the way that current child
 
01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:21.719 align:start position:0%
protection laws are written dcyf is
 
01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
tasked with sometimes impossible
 
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
standards already and so how are we
 
01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
going to add this to their plate and
 
01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:29.820 align:start position:0%
expect them to to continue to be
 
01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
effective when the laws are written in
 
01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
fact in a way that makes them not as
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
effective as they could be one more
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
sentence yep
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
it can be a complex compound sentence
 
01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:42.310 align:start position:0%
it can be a complex compound sentence
um

01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
I don't necessarily think I have the
 
01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
bandwidth for complex because I'm going
 
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
to the other hearing as well but thank
 
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
you so much for your time I really
 
01:52:51.169 --> 01:52:51.179 align:start position:0%
appreciate you on the way over would you
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
take one question please yes I do have a
 
01:52:55.629 --> 01:52:55.639 align:start position:0%
staff of Family Practice
 
01:52:59.629 --> 01:52:59.639 align:start position:0%
providers and counselors so I'm just the
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
liberal arts guy in the building yeah
 
01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
you know but I have asked them this
 
01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:05.330 align:start position:0%
you know but I have asked them this
question

01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:07.609 --> 01:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
about how many
 
01:53:07.619 --> 01:53:09.169 align:start position:0%
about how many
youngsters

01:53:09.169 --> 01:53:09.179 align:start position:0%
youngsters
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
age 10 11 12 13.
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
same-sex affection
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
or a sense of
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
I'm something other that then transition
 
01:53:23.639 --> 01:53:25.550 align:start position:0%
I'm something other that then transition
out

01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:53:28.129 --> 01:53:28.139 align:start position:0%
in your research because I have mine
 
01:53:28.139 --> 01:53:29.330 align:start position:0%
in your research because I have mine
so

01:53:29.330 --> 01:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
in my research which we I glean a lot
 
01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:33.350 align:start position:0%
in my research which we I glean a lot
from

01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
um the Trevor Project so if any of you
 
01:53:37.129 --> 01:53:37.139 align:start position:0%
are interested that's a really great
 
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
resource the Trevor Project
 
01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:40.729 align:start position:0%
resource the Trevor Project
um

01:53:40.729 --> 01:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know because and it's hard to
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
look at it from my experience because
 
01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
like we work the practice that I work in
 
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
and as my practice as well we work on
 
01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
the exploration process okay we kind of
 
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
let it be what it's going to be as
 
01:53:55.609 --> 01:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
opposed to saying oh this person's going
 
01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
to transition or this person's not okay
 
01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:58.430 align:start position:0%
to transition or this person's not okay
yeah

01:53:58.430 --> 01:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:54:01.609 --> 01:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
folks that may have had a sense for and
 
01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to use polite word I really
 
01:54:05.629 --> 01:54:05.639 align:start position:0%
sure am and there's so many impolite
 
01:54:07.209 --> 01:54:07.219 align:start position:0%
words all over the place
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
folks youngsters who feel a certain way
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
for a month or two or three or a year
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
and then don't feel that way anymore
 
01:54:18.890 --> 01:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
um is a statistic too and you know like
 
01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
I said I've got some it sounds like your
 
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
practice is not with that population
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
it is and it isn't because we encourage
 
01:54:28.129 --> 01:54:28.139 align:start position:0%
exploration of that because it's a
 
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
normal developmental process sure the
 
01:54:31.609 --> 01:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
explosion of gender and sexuality is
 
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely normal so we encourage that
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
okay we don't necessarily
 
01:54:38.450 --> 01:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily actually take data
 
01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:40.679 align:start position:0%
on how many of those people come out as
 
01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
lgbtqia plus okay yeah appreciate that
 
01:54:44.689 --> 01:54:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:44.699 --> 01:54:49.250 align:start position:0%
thank you
yes

01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:50.810 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:54:50.810 --> 01:54:50.820 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much and the chair is
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
now looking for
 
01:54:58.729 --> 01:54:58.739 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's Henry Feldman a

01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
um I actually have an answer to the
 
01:55:22.189 --> 01:55:22.199 align:start position:0%
previous question sir if you'd like it
 
01:55:25.609 --> 01:55:25.619 align:start position:0%
um there was research done uh
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
came out in the summer of 2022 that said
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
that generally kids who start a social
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
what we call a social transition
 
01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.689 align:start position:0%
what we call a social transition
um will

01:55:34.689 --> 01:55:34.699 align:start position:0%
um will
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
97.4 of them will persist into
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
um a medical transition at some point in
 
01:55:45.530 --> 01:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
their life so the clinical standard is
 
01:55:48.010 --> 01:55:48.020 align:start position:0%
insistence consistence and persistence
 
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
and so what that data tracked was kids
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
five years after initiating a social
 
01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:54.950 align:start position:0%
five years after initiating a social
transition

01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
transition
 
01:55:57.530 --> 01:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
this is for transgender not same-sex
 
01:55:59.689 --> 01:55:59.699 align:start position:0%
attraction right so okay thank you I
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
just wanted to get absolutely yep kids
 
01:56:03.709 --> 01:56:03.719 align:start position:0%
who are assigned a gender at Birth as we
 
01:56:06.109 --> 01:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
all are and then assert that their
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
assignment at Birth was incorrect
 
01:56:11.450 --> 01:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
okay sure
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
um my name is Harvey Feldman thank you
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
to the committee for hearing my
 
01:56:18.169 --> 01:56:18.179 align:start position:0%
testimony I am from Concord I'm here
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
today to voice my strong opposition to
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 417 I'm a licensed therapist
 
01:56:24.290 --> 01:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I have clinical
 
01:56:26.689 --> 01:56:26.699 align:start position:0%
expertise in working with lgbtq youth
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
and their families every day I see the
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
life-saving nature of gender affirming
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
care and if there ever was an opposite
 
01:56:34.910 --> 01:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
to child abuse and neglect gender
 
01:56:37.370 --> 01:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
affirming care would be it before I
 
01:56:38.810 --> 01:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
entered Private Practice I was a
 
01:56:40.609 --> 01:56:40.619 align:start position:0%
clinician working primarily with youth
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
in systems of care and partnered often
 
01:56:45.169 --> 01:56:45.179 align:start position:0%
with dcyf offices and workers throughout
 
01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
the state I've seen child abuse and
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
neglect up close and spent the early
 
01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:50.820 align:start position:0%
part of my career supporting families
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
through the process of reunification
 
01:56:54.649 --> 01:56:54.659 align:start position:0%
when possible and Foster Care and
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
Adoption when it wasn't
 
01:56:58.609 --> 01:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
the dcyf workers I had the chance to get
 
01:57:00.109 --> 01:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
to know during those years were some of
 
01:57:01.729 --> 01:57:01.739 align:start position:0%
the most dedicated professionals I've
 
01:57:04.010 --> 01:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
ever seen and their commitment to Youth
 
01:57:06.770 --> 01:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
and Care was and is unending
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
this bill quite frankly is horrifying it
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
would require those already over taxed
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
workers to open cases investigate
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
families and perhaps remove youth from
 
01:57:19.370 --> 01:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
loving safe families if systems of care
 
01:57:20.990 --> 01:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire were functioning at a
 
01:57:22.729 --> 01:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
hundred percent capacity and perfect
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
this bill would still be horrifying
 
01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
however I can say confidently that the
 
01:57:29.689 --> 01:57:29.699 align:start position:0%
system is broken there are not enough
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
caseworkers safe Foster families or
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
clinical resources to support the amount
 
01:57:35.570 --> 01:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
of children and families in the system
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
now today
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
lgbtq youth who are in systems of care
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
are already disproportionately subject
 
01:57:44.589 --> 01:57:44.599 align:start position:0%
to discriminatory harmful practices
 
01:57:47.089 --> 01:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
including conversion therapy and tactics
 
01:57:49.609 --> 01:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
and removing them from safe affirmative
 
01:57:51.770 --> 01:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
homes is truly one of the most unethical
 
01:57:54.169 --> 01:57:54.179 align:start position:0%
unsafe decisions I can imagine
 
01:57:56.330 --> 01:57:56.340 align:start position:0%
as a licensed therapist this bill would
 
01:57:58.189 --> 01:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
require me to report families who are
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
accessing gender affirming care care
 
01:58:02.089 --> 01:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
that is accepted to be the safest and
 
01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:03.719 align:start position:0%
most protective families can give to
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
their children it might require another
 
01:58:07.970 --> 01:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
provider to report me for practicing
 
01:58:10.010 --> 01:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
ethically and within clinical standards
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
as I said I've seen child abuse up close
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
and equating gender affirming care to
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
what I've had to witness is deeply
 
01:58:18.890 --> 01:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
deeply offensive just give you 20
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
seconds to wrap it up okay if this bill
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
were to pass it would mean that the
 
01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
therapists and providers would have to
 
01:58:25.729 --> 01:58:25.739 align:start position:0%
choose between ethical practice and
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
state law thank you very much and I urge
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
you to retain or kill or stop this bill
 
01:58:34.609 --> 01:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
please thank you if you'd like us all to
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
have copies please sure and I'm
 
01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
available for questions if folks have
 
01:58:39.530 --> 01:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
them now or later
 
01:58:41.629 --> 01:58:41.639 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford uh thank you Mr
 
01:58:43.129 --> 01:58:43.139 align:start position:0%
chairman I have a nagging question
 
01:58:45.770 --> 01:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
please do you need to ask a question
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
they're getting really tight on us
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
asking questions
 
01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:53.390 align:start position:0%
asking questions
okay

01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
um why does it need to be done at a
 
01:58:58.910 --> 01:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
pubistant as opposed to at the adult age
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
do you mean what can you just tell me
 
01:59:02.450 --> 01:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
01:59:04.729 --> 01:59:04.739 align:start position:0%
um why is the issue here is because it's
 
01:59:07.570 --> 01:59:07.580 align:start position:0%
done below at the younger than 18. right
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
why does it need to be done at that time
 
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
as opposed to waiting until they're
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
adults well what we know from research
 
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
is that mental health outcomes improve
 
01:59:18.290 --> 01:59:18.300 align:start position:0%
significantly when kids can access
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
medical affirming care and so the why is
 
01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
because anxiety depression self-harm
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
Health disparities all go down when kids
 
01:59:29.810 --> 01:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
can access medically affirming care so
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
you might be asking why medically and
 
01:59:34.089 --> 01:59:34.099 align:start position:0%
I'm answering with a mental health
 
01:59:36.589 --> 01:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
outcome because the data is very clear
 
01:59:38.290 --> 01:59:38.300 align:start position:0%
that mental health outcomes are
 
01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:40.679 align:start position:0%
significantly better for kids who can go
 
01:59:42.890 --> 01:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
through medical transition when they're
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
ready to do so
 
01:59:46.609 --> 01:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
and we don't in this country as far as I
 
01:59:46.619 --> 01:59:47.570 align:start position:0%
and we don't in this country as far as I
know

01:59:47.570 --> 01:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
um there's no other medical care that's
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
divided out by age this way there might
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
be different phases of it or different
 
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
steps in it but there's no other
 
01:59:57.410 --> 01:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
prohibition I know of around 18 versus
 
01:59:59.209 --> 01:59:59.219 align:start position:0%
not 18. there are kids who get breast
 
02:00:02.330 --> 02:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
augmentation there are um kids who go on
 
02:00:04.189 --> 02:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers for precocious puberty
 
02:00:06.169 --> 02:00:06.179 align:start position:0%
all that happens earlier in their life
 
02:00:08.570 --> 02:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
than 18 and so I think we also have to
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
ask why we surveil and question certain
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of medical care and not others
 
02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
um my question
 
02:00:25.490 --> 02:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm a big like survey and data junkie
 
02:00:27.709 --> 02:00:27.719 align:start position:0%
so I was just curious
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I I wanted to know more about
 
02:00:34.010 --> 02:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
um if you could tell me or remember you
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
know that the um
 
02:00:39.530 --> 02:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
the statistic the 97.4 percent continued
 
02:00:41.450 --> 02:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
to transition can you tell me where you
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
yeah remember where you got that from
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's called the trans youth
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
project it was initially started out of
 
02:00:49.729 --> 02:00:49.739 align:start position:0%
uh University of Washington and then the
 
02:00:51.890 --> 02:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
researcher Christina Olsen moved to
 
02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
Princeton and that's where she is now
 
02:00:55.490 --> 02:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
and it's the first
 
02:00:58.850 --> 02:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
um it's the first longitudinal study of
 
02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
trans youth over time so we have so if
 
02:01:02.930 --> 02:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
you're a gender nerd like me we have the
 
02:01:05.330 --> 02:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
five-year data came out in 2022 we'll
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
have more data in five years so she's
 
02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
essentially the trans youth project as
 
02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
this cohort of kids growing into adults
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
and she's going to follow them and so
 
02:01:16.729 --> 02:01:16.739 align:start position:0%
that initial data was 97.4 okay great I
 
02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and I was actually
 
02:01:19.729 --> 02:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
typing what you were saying I don't know
 
02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
what you think I was being rude okay no
 
02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
no representative panic
 
02:01:26.450 --> 02:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman Pearson for allow
 
02:01:28.250 --> 02:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
me to ask the question
 
02:01:30.169 --> 02:01:30.179 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the time to
 
02:01:31.850 --> 02:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
come up here and explain things to us
 
02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:33.169 align:start position:0%
come up here and explain things to us
sure

02:01:33.169 --> 02:01:33.179 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:01:33.179 --> 02:01:34.070 align:start position:0%
sure
um

02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:36.530 --> 02:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
you said that the five-year dad just
 
02:01:40.189 --> 02:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
came in at 2022. and this it was
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
released published in the summer of
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
2018. so how long have these studies
 
02:01:47.689 --> 02:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
been going on that the puberty blockers
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
and hormone therapy
 
02:01:53.810 --> 02:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
is the correct answer right to introduce
 
02:01:56.089 --> 02:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
it to these children that are like 10 13
 
02:01:59.330 --> 02:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
years old so we've been using maybe not
 
02:02:01.370 --> 02:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
me personally but you know the big we
 
02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
have been using puberty blockers for
 
02:02:05.689 --> 02:02:05.699 align:start position:0%
what we call precocious puberty since
 
02:02:05.699 --> 02:02:07.189 align:start position:0%
what we call precocious puberty since
1980.

02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
1980.
 
02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
um and that's for kids who are not
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
transgender but medically enter into
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
puberty before they should
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and so they're given puberty blockers
 
02:02:16.609 --> 02:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
to stop that from happening and then
 
02:02:18.410 --> 02:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
they stop they stop taking the blockers
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
that are puberty resumed so we have that
 
02:02:21.790 --> 02:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
data from 1980
 
02:02:24.290 --> 02:02:24.300 align:start position:0%
across hormone therapy and puberty
 
02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
blockers for Trans kids we can trace
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
that probably back to the late 80s early
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
90s and so it is correct that we don't
 
02:02:34.030 --> 02:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
have you know 40 or 40 or 50 year
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
longitudinal data on this what we do
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
have is the statistics and the
 
02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
information about self-harm and suicide
 
02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:43.910 align:start position:0%
information about self-harm and suicide
follow-up

02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:47.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:51.050 --> 02:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
the puberty blockers and the hormone
 
02:02:55.550 --> 02:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
therapy that are being prescribed yep
 
02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:56.990 align:start position:0%
therapy that are being prescribed yep
um

02:02:56.990 --> 02:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:00.649 --> 02:03:00.659 align:start position:0%
are these FDA approved
 
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
for that specific
 
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
or are you using this like off label I'm
 
02:03:10.490 --> 02:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
I thought yeah it's it's off label so it
 
02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
is if so I guess I would say it's FDA
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
approved but use
 
02:03:18.850 --> 02:03:18.860 align:start position:0%
off label it's not going to say it
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
yep there's lots of things sure sure so
 
02:03:26.330 --> 02:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
like ivermectin for example yeah thank
 
02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
you that's a good example
 
02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:31.070 align:start position:0%
you that's a good example
um

02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:33.169 --> 02:03:33.179 align:start position:0%
I think there's many more I'm blanking
 
02:03:35.149 --> 02:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
on them but there's many more
 
02:03:35.159 --> 02:03:37.189 align:start position:0%
on them but there's many more
okay

02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Council appreciate the
 
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair now recognizes Emma

Health policy coordinator at new Futures
 
02:04:02.570 --> 02:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
my comments have largely been stated by
 
02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
The Fabulous folks who've spoken so far
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%

having a little extra time so I'm going
 
02:04:11.209 --> 02:04:11.219 align:start position:0%
to yield my time and just underscore the
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
importance that this bill should be uh
 
02:04:16.070 --> 02:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
voted in inexpedient to legislate and
 
02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
that the gender affirming care is not
 
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
child abuse and is in fact critical of
 
02:04:23.330 --> 02:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
care for children's who need positive
 
02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:25.020 align:start position:0%

I do not have written comments uh dcyf
 
02:04:59.870 --> 02:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
is in opposition to this bill it does
 
02:05:03.010 --> 02:05:03.020 align:start position:0%
not consider gender uh assignment
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
procedures or surgeries to be a form of
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
child abuse and I'm willing to take any
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm very grateful for that

the chair is going to disagree with that
 
02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
we've appreciated your answers to our
 
02:05:26.890 --> 02:05:26.900 align:start position:0%
questions chair recognizes sales Karsten
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
and you've got written testimony and if
 
02:05:39.290 --> 02:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
you want us to each have a copy you can
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
pass it down at the end if if you don't
 
02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
that's okay too and you got two minutes
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you uh on sales Captain I
 
02:05:46.970 --> 02:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
live in Dover I'm here representing New
 
02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire youth movement a Youth
 
02:05:50.450 --> 02:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
Organization with many trans student
 
02:05:53.209 --> 02:05:53.219 align:start position:0%
members uh should this bill pass parents
 
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
who follow Professional Medical guidance
 
02:05:56.450 --> 02:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
and from the gender identity of their
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
children would be charged with child
 
02:06:00.050 --> 02:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
abuse it's the ridiculous attack on
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
chance gender transgender children and
 
02:06:03.770 --> 02:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
supportive parents and it would result
 
02:06:05.330 --> 02:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
in young people across the state not
 
02:06:07.310 --> 02:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
being able to receive gender affirming
 
02:06:09.290 --> 02:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
medical care when needed I think there's
 
02:06:10.609 --> 02:06:10.619 align:start position:0%
a lot of misinformation about what it
 
02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
means and looks like for young people to
 
02:06:14.330 --> 02:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
go through a gender transition and I
 
02:06:16.010 --> 02:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
hope to clear some of that up
 
02:06:17.810 --> 02:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
gender transitions are not child abuse
 
02:06:19.250 --> 02:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
there's consensus among medical
 
02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
researchers that gender transitions
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
effectively treat gender dysphoria and
 
02:06:24.890 --> 02:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
improve the well-being of transgender
 
02:06:27.410 --> 02:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
individuals by far the most common of
 
02:06:28.729 --> 02:06:28.739 align:start position:0%
these treatments among youth is hormone
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
blockers which are pills or shots that
 
02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
delay the effects of puberty the effect
 
02:06:34.370 --> 02:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
of hormone blockers is entirely
 
02:06:36.530 --> 02:06:36.540 align:start position:0%
reversible and the use of blockers is
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
associated with improve improving
 
02:06:41.209 --> 02:06:41.219 align:start position:0%
overall well-being reducing depression
 
02:06:44.089 --> 02:06:44.099 align:start position:0%
self-harm anxiety and suicidal thoughts
 
02:06:47.450 --> 02:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
and social interactions with other kids
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
in addition in many situations all
 
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
parties agree that a transition is a
 
02:06:53.689 --> 02:06:53.699 align:start position:0%
good idea parents are supportive of
 
02:06:55.970 --> 02:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
their child transitioning the child or
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
young person wants to wants to
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
transition and the medical professional
 
02:07:01.850 --> 02:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
involved is also supportive
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
in a situation where parents the
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
individual and the medical professional
 
02:07:07.370 --> 02:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
are all on the same page why should the
 
02:07:09.649 --> 02:07:09.659 align:start position:0%
state be involved at all no one is being
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
unharmed and everyone is in agreement
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
gender transitions are well researched
 
02:07:16.129 --> 02:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
safe procedures that improve the
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
well-being of a transgender person we
 
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
aren't asking for a lot we're only
 
02:07:21.169 --> 02:07:21.179 align:start position:0%
asking for the government to stay out of
 
02:07:22.970 --> 02:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
people's personal medical business

hello I do not have a written testimony
 
02:07:51.770 --> 02:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
I was actually inspired while sitting
 
02:07:53.570 --> 02:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
there that I wanted to say something so
 
02:07:55.490 --> 02:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
I'm going to wing it with some notes I
 
02:07:58.189 --> 02:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
made on my phone I am here as the mother

while I've done my research over the
 
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
years I am not here with data or figures
 
02:08:07.370 --> 02:08:07.380 align:start position:0%

02:08:16.129 --> 02:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
I am here to tell you what being a
 
02:08:19.490 --> 02:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
parent of a transgender teen is for me
 
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
it means watching your child withdraw
 
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
into themselves without any idea why it
 
02:08:25.609 --> 02:08:25.619 align:start position:0%
means learning that your child is
 
02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
self-harming without any idea why
 
02:08:30.169 --> 02:08:30.179 align:start position:0%
it means fearing that your child could
 
02:08:34.070 --> 02:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
take their own life without any idea why
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
I have always been an open-minded Ally
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
even received awards for that when I was
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
working before I had children but when
 
02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
my son finally told me that he was my
 
02:08:45.530 --> 02:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
son and not my daughter I internally
 
02:08:48.649 --> 02:08:48.659 align:start position:0%
freaked out I sobbed in private I talked
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
to my therapist I dove into research and
 
02:08:53.689 --> 02:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
I hoped this wasn't real
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
and none of that was because I wasn't
 
02:08:56.930 --> 02:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
willing to accept what I was being told
 
02:08:59.330 --> 02:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
by my son but because I knew that his
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
life would suddenly be so much harder
 
02:09:02.570 --> 02:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
that he would be bullied and
 
02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
discriminated against and I feared for
 
02:09:07.010 --> 02:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
his future and his safety
 
02:09:09.470 --> 02:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
over time through continued therapy soul
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
searching and open communication that
 
02:09:12.890 --> 02:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
I'm lucky enough to have with my son
 
02:09:15.169 --> 02:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
I came to accept that this was his truth
 
02:09:17.330 --> 02:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
he wasn't transgender because it was fun
 
02:09:19.370 --> 02:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
I think it is in fact far from that for
 
02:09:19.380 --> 02:09:20.089 align:start position:0%
I think it is in fact far from that for
him

02:09:20.089 --> 02:09:20.099 align:start position:0%
him
 
02:09:22.129 --> 02:09:22.139 align:start position:0%
he was transgender because he was simply
 
02:09:24.109 --> 02:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
born in a body that didn't match who he
 
02:09:26.450 --> 02:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
is and he finally had a voice and an
 
02:09:28.850 --> 02:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
understanding to share that with us
 
02:09:31.490 --> 02:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
I love my son unconditionally I would
 
02:09:33.229 --> 02:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
die for him
 
02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
and by supporting and providing him with
 
02:09:37.550 --> 02:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
access to affirming care that is not
 
02:09:40.129 --> 02:09:40.139 align:start position:0%
what child abuse is to me that is what
 
02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
being a loving parent is
 
02:09:43.550 --> 02:09:43.560 align:start position:0%

um

02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
I'm writing to ask you to oppose hb417
 
02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
my formative years were not my best I
 
02:10:29.330 --> 02:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
faced regular emotional abuse I was
 
02:10:30.890 --> 02:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
molded to believe that I was not good
 
02:10:33.470 --> 02:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
enough in any regard my grades were not
 
02:10:35.089 --> 02:10:35.099 align:start position:0%
good enough my interests were not good
 
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
enough and my personality was not good
 
02:10:39.169 --> 02:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
enough when I let it slip that I might
 
02:10:41.330 --> 02:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
be bisexual I faced its high rate of
 
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
slurs that drove me out of my home
 
02:10:45.410 --> 02:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
I learned to never let it slip that I am
 
02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:46.970 align:start position:0%
I learned to never let it slip that I am
transgender

02:10:46.970 --> 02:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
all of this led me to being an adult
 
02:10:51.649 --> 02:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
struggling with my sense of self the one
 
02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
thing I know is that if I had parents
 
02:10:55.850 --> 02:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
that were accepting of being back then
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
my entire life would have been different
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I would be in a better place now
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you this because there are
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
thousands of children across the country
 
02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
with parents like mine children who will
 
02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
not be supported in their interest and
 
02:11:09.410 --> 02:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
Endeavor and face backlash for not being
 
02:11:11.930 --> 02:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
an exact replica of their parents and
 
02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:13.619 align:start position:0%
who might be put in dangerous situations
 
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
if it comes out that they're a member of
 
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq plus community and then there
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
are children whose parents are the
 
02:11:21.709 --> 02:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
opposite they are warm loving and
 
02:11:24.109 --> 02:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
accepting no matter what this bill will
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
criminalize those types of parents while
 
02:11:29.149 --> 02:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
the parents who really do abuse their
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
kids will likely never have to face the
 
02:11:33.770 --> 02:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
same consequences this is wrong gender
 
02:11:35.689 --> 02:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
affirming care is life-saving especially
 
02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
for young kids we're not talking about
 
02:11:40.129 --> 02:11:40.139 align:start position:0%
things like surgeries gender affirming
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
surgeries are incredibly rare for Trans
 
02:11:43.490 --> 02:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
children as it is with things like
 
02:11:45.050 --> 02:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
hormone blockers can make all the
 
02:11:46.729 --> 02:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
difference to Insurance child's mental
 
02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
health therefore their life path
 
02:11:51.649 --> 02:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
the parents who understand this and take
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate action should not be
 
02:11:54.589 --> 02:11:54.599 align:start position:0%
punished they are doing what the parent
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
is supposed to do they are taking care
 
02:11:58.490 --> 02:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
of their child that they brought into
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
this world not only not everyone is born
 
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
into a family that will accept and
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
support them which is terrible
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
enough reality you have 15 seconds
 
02:12:11.689 --> 02:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
please okay
 
02:12:13.729 --> 02:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
um those who are lucky enough to receive
 
02:12:15.229 --> 02:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
that type of love should be able to
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
basket it not worried about their
 
02:12:19.370 --> 02:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
parents being reported to CPS anyways
 
02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:21.310 align:start position:0%
parents being reported to CPS anyways
please

02:12:21.310 --> 02:12:21.320 align:start position:0%

02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
I have a copy of this and you can feel
 
02:12:47.810 --> 02:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
well hi everyone my name is Ben Kramer
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident of Newmarket here to
 
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
testify in opposition to this bill I
 
02:12:56.030 --> 02:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
worked with young people and children
 
02:12:58.250 --> 02:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
for about five years as a camp counselor
 
02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
adventure trip leader and camp director
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
those years were the single most
 
02:13:04.250 --> 02:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
impactful experience I've had giving me
 
02:13:05.930 --> 02:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
insight into lives and experiences of
 
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
young people and children worked
 
02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
extremely closely with kids ages 6 to 18
 
02:13:12.290 --> 02:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
and their parents I also have a degree
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
in outdoor education
 
02:13:16.609 --> 02:13:16.619 align:start position:0%
I know kids who are navigating being
 
02:13:18.410 --> 02:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
transgender at a young age
 
02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
some were presenting as their true
 
02:13:22.129 --> 02:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
gender for the first time at Camp some
 
02:13:23.930 --> 02:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
had recently begun receiving gender
 
02:13:26.209 --> 02:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
affirming Health Care those children who
 
02:13:27.649 --> 02:13:27.659 align:start position:0%
for the first time were seen as their
 
02:13:29.450 --> 02:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
authentic selves were some of the
 
02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
happiest kids I've worked with and their
 
02:13:32.450 --> 02:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
parents some of the most loving I've
 
02:13:33.890 --> 02:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
ever met
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
I've also known children experiencing
 
02:13:37.370 --> 02:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
I've interacted with parents who were
 
02:13:41.089 --> 02:13:41.099 align:start position:0%
abusive I've reported suspected child
 
02:13:43.729 --> 02:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
abuse as a mandated reporter I was
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
trained extensively in how to recognize
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
it and trained others
 
02:13:48.649 --> 02:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
the experiences of these children
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
experiencing abuse could not be more
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
different than the trans kids being
 
02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
affirmed in their identity those parents
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
are not the same
 
02:13:57.890 --> 02:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
not once did I as a mandated reporter
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
and a child care professional consider
 
02:14:01.729 --> 02:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
that abusive parents and parents who
 
02:14:03.410 --> 02:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
affirm their trans child would both be
 
02:14:06.050 --> 02:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
abusive because they are simply not
 
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
as a parent affirming their trans child
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
is the exact opposite of abuse they
 
02:14:12.050 --> 02:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
could not be more dissimilar affirming a
 
02:14:13.850 --> 02:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
child's identity is an act of love and
 
02:14:15.950 --> 02:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
support to classify it as abuse is
 
02:14:17.089 --> 02:14:17.099 align:start position:0%
simply wrong
 
02:14:18.770 --> 02:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to vote in experience
 
02:14:20.810 --> 02:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
legislate or retain this Bill thank you
 
02:14:23.209 --> 02:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:40.129 --> 02:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
good morning I will email my testimony
 
02:14:44.209 --> 02:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
to you
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'm Reverend Kendra Ford and I am a
 
02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
Unitarian Universalist Minister I served
 
02:14:51.609 --> 02:14:51.619 align:start position:0%
the congregation in Exeter for 21 years
 
02:14:55.250 --> 02:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
and now I am a climate activist with 350
 
02:14:57.169 --> 02:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:14:59.930 --> 02:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
what kind of activist climate claimant
 
02:15:02.330 --> 02:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
climate I'm sorry climate change is the
 
02:15:04.970 --> 02:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
issue I am working on but I am also here
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
for this bill because
 
02:15:11.629 --> 02:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
standing up for life on this planet is
 
02:15:13.970 --> 02:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
part of my work in the world
 
02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
so I oppose this bill strongly
 
02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:19.490 align:start position:0%
so I oppose this bill strongly
because

02:15:19.490 --> 02:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:15:22.609 --> 02:15:22.619 align:start position:0%
because I'm here for life and for love
 
02:15:25.790 --> 02:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
and for making sure that life gets to
 
02:15:30.410 --> 02:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
bloom in its fullness and its complexity
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
I think it's important that religious
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
people stand up even in this context
 
02:15:38.450 --> 02:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
maybe especially in this context to say
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
that in our society at Large
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
the religious claim includes this claim
 
02:15:51.169 --> 02:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
that being lgbtq is just life being in
 
02:15:53.390 --> 02:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
full bloom
 
02:15:55.370 --> 02:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
so you've heard from the medical
 
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
professionals you've heard from the
 
02:15:59.209 --> 02:15:59.219 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals you've heard
 
02:16:01.250 --> 02:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
the statistics and the studies all of
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
which support that gender transition is
 
02:16:08.089 --> 02:16:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
and I want to tell you something about
 
02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
my religious tradition in particular
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
which is that Covenant is really
 
02:16:17.629 --> 02:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
important to us Covenant is a promise
 
02:16:20.089 --> 02:16:20.099 align:start position:0%
that we make in community
 
02:16:22.609 --> 02:16:22.619 align:start position:0%
promise about how we'll live together
 
02:16:26.089 --> 02:16:26.099 align:start position:0%
and how we'll live in this world
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
and one of the pieces of our covenant is
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
to respect the inherent worth and
 
02:16:33.889 --> 02:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
dignity of each person
 
02:16:37.250 --> 02:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
that means letting each person discover
 
02:16:39.889 --> 02:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
who they are in community and you've
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
heard that described now about gender
 
02:16:43.129 --> 02:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
transition over and over again that it
 
02:16:45.650 --> 02:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
isn't something that's just someone
 
02:16:47.389 --> 02:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
wakes up someday and says oh let's do
 
02:16:47.399 --> 02:16:48.049 align:start position:0%
wakes up someday and says oh let's do
this

02:16:48.049 --> 02:16:48.059 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:16:50.990 --> 02:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's something that they discover very
 
02:16:53.330 --> 02:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
deeply about themselves and I think many
 
02:16:56.209 --> 02:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
humans find that their gender isn't a
 
02:16:59.150 --> 02:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
really important part of their identity
 
02:17:02.709 --> 02:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
and we want that acknowledged and
 
02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
expressed in community
 
02:17:08.690 --> 02:17:08.700 align:start position:0%
and so of course that's going to be rich
 
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
and varied in this life so
 
02:17:13.969 --> 02:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
in my Covenant
 
02:17:17.330 --> 02:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
I affirm that for all people and I
 
02:17:20.450 --> 02:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
affirm people to find their own way with
 
02:17:20.460 --> 02:17:21.349 align:start position:0%
affirm people to find their own way with
that

02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:24.650 --> 02:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
with support in community so the folks
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
who wrote this bill maybe want to take
 
02:17:28.669 --> 02:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
care of children
 
02:17:30.830 --> 02:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
which is such a great thing and there
 
02:17:32.810 --> 02:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
are so many ways to do that I've heard
 
02:17:36.049 --> 02:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
from people from dcyf today they could
 
02:17:38.089 --> 02:17:38.099 align:start position:0%
use a lot of funding and some funding
 
02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
for that department would help a lot of
 
02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:42.770 align:start position:0%
for that department would help a lot of
children

02:17:42.770 --> 02:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:17:44.750 --> 02:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
we could increase food subsidies we
 
02:17:46.969 --> 02:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
could increase school funding we could
 
02:17:48.530 --> 02:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
increase mental health funding in our
 
02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
state those are things that would really
 
02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
protect children
 
02:17:54.889 --> 02:17:54.899 align:start position:0%
and I hope that those things can be
 
02:17:57.589 --> 02:17:57.599 align:start position:0%
taken up and done so that we can indeed
 
02:18:01.549 --> 02:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
take care of people well in our culture
 
02:18:03.530 --> 02:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
next I'll call up
 
02:18:24.169 --> 02:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Lori Warnock and
 
02:18:28.490 --> 02:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
I live in Hampstead I wanted to
 
02:18:30.410 --> 02:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
specifically address a comment made by
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I'm sorry he
 
02:18:34.370 --> 02:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
stepped out of the room when he equated
 
02:18:37.490 --> 02:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
the use of ivermectin and its off-label
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
use with the use of FDA approved and
 
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
long used and tested medical
 
02:18:48.650 --> 02:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
interventions to prolong the development
 
02:18:51.410 --> 02:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
of secondary sex characteristics which
 
02:18:54.169 --> 02:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
is a temporary and reversible process
 
02:18:56.750 --> 02:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
that has been used medically and has
 
02:18:58.849 --> 02:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
been used by medical practitioners and
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
recommended by medical practitioners as
 
02:19:06.770 --> 02:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
opposed to the use of horse paste as an
 
02:19:10.129 --> 02:19:10.139 align:start position:0%
unproven method of preventing or
 
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
treating covid-19 while Ivermectin is in
 
02:19:17.810 --> 02:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
some cases available for human use it is
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
not in any way shape or form used
 
02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
previously for the prevention of virus
 
02:19:24.290 --> 02:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
transmission it's used to treat
 
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
parasites I think it was a very false
 
02:19:30.169 --> 02:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
equivalent to compare a drug that has
 
02:19:32.929 --> 02:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
been used off label recommended
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
predominantly for animals in an untested
 
02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:37.250 align:start position:0%
predominantly for animals in an untested
manner

02:19:37.250 --> 02:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
manner
 
02:19:40.129 --> 02:19:40.139 align:start position:0%
to compare that to the use of FDA
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
approved medications in the appropriate
 
02:19:44.929 --> 02:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
way for which they were developed and
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
have been tested and have been applied
 
02:19:51.250 --> 02:19:51.260 align:start position:0%
as a comparison when we're talking about
 
02:19:54.349 --> 02:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
identifying child abuse this is an
 
02:19:56.330 --> 02:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
appropriate medical treatment it has
 
02:19:58.310 --> 02:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
been long practiced and proven these are
 
02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
medications which have been proven safe
 
02:20:02.929 --> 02:20:02.939 align:start position:0%
in exactly this age group for exactly
 
02:20:06.050 --> 02:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
this purpose so I think to create the
 
02:20:08.810 --> 02:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
impression that the off-label use of
 
02:20:11.330 --> 02:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
these appropriate medications that are
 
02:20:14.330 --> 02:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
in fact reversible so that a child as
 
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
they grow can fully realize their
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
identity and make their own decisions as
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
older children or adolescents or adults
 
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
comparing that to the off-label use of a
 
02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine
 
02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
is inappropriate
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
I work as an educator for the Northern
 
02:20:37.130 --> 02:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
New England poison Center I'm speaking
 
02:20:39.650 --> 02:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
on behalf of myself today not as a
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative of the poison Center but
 
02:20:43.849 --> 02:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
I can tell you we have seen over the
 
02:20:46.969 --> 02:20:46.979 align:start position:0%
past five years a dramatic increase in
 
02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
suicide attempts and self-harm among
 
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
younger and younger children and I
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
cannot stress the fact that anything we
 
02:20:58.130 --> 02:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
do to jeopardize their mental health
 
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
when especially when we're talking about
 
02:21:04.670 --> 02:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
a system that is already under serving
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
this population
 
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
would constitute child abuse and I thank
 
02:21:11.389 --> 02:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
you for taking the time this morning to
 
02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
02:21:15.050 --> 02:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:19.849 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
panic

02:21:19.849 --> 02:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.309 --> 02:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you I thank you representative
 
02:21:22.319 --> 02:21:23.389 align:start position:0%
thank you I thank you representative
long

02:21:23.389 --> 02:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
long
 
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:31.130 --> 02:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
are there cases where
 
02:21:31.140 --> 02:21:33.110 align:start position:0%
are there cases where
um

02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
when they're using the puberty blockers
 
02:21:37.370 --> 02:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
and the hormones
 
02:21:41.290 --> 02:21:41.300 align:start position:0%
that the parents are not
 
02:21:46.969 --> 02:21:46.979 align:start position:0%
aware of that treatment or they always
 
02:21:49.130 --> 02:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not qualified to address that
 
02:21:51.170 --> 02:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
question I think there are probably
 
02:21:52.969 --> 02:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
medical professionals in here that are
 
02:21:55.010 --> 02:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
more aware of the Privacy practices
 
02:21:58.429 --> 02:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
between practitioners young adolescents
 
02:21:59.929 --> 02:21:59.939 align:start position:0%
and parents
 
02:22:02.270 --> 02:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
 
02:22:03.889 --> 02:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
see you then
 
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
just a reminder that we're about two
 
02:22:24.830 --> 02:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you
 
02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair Pearson members of

um you will hear plenty of information
 
02:22:49.550 --> 02:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
about uh the benefits of gender
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
affirming health care for transgender
 
02:22:53.210 --> 02:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
Youth and other youth experiencing
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria you will also hear
 
02:22:58.490 --> 02:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
plenty about the harms that come from
 
02:23:01.309 --> 02:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
denying access to health care I want to
 
02:23:03.530 --> 02:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
focus I'm an attorney with glbtq legal
 
02:23:05.330 --> 02:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
Advocates and Defenders glad based in
 
02:23:07.130 --> 02:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
Boston my New Hampshire licensed
 
02:23:08.929 --> 02:23:08.939 align:start position:0%
attorney and
 
02:23:11.389 --> 02:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
um I want to focus on the legal issues
 
02:23:14.270 --> 02:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
that uh come into play with respect to
 
02:23:15.710 --> 02:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
um I think that you probably know that
 
02:23:21.889 --> 02:23:21.899 align:start position:0%
similar legislation has been passed
 
02:23:24.349 --> 02:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
prohibiting uh parents from being able
 
02:23:26.750 --> 02:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
to obtain health care for their children
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
who are experiencing gender dysphoria in
 
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
other states and
 
02:23:32.210 --> 02:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
um in two states there have been
 
02:23:35.570 --> 02:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
lawsuits uh both of which have resulted
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
in the injunctions against the laws and
 
02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
the basis for those lawsuits is
 
02:23:43.250 --> 02:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
constitutional claims that they violate
 
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
both the rights of the parents because
 
02:23:47.210 --> 02:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
parents have the right to direct the
 
02:23:48.650 --> 02:23:48.660 align:start position:0%
upbringing of their children and nothing
 
02:23:50.570 --> 02:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
is more essential to that right than
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
making Health Care decisions in
 
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
partnership with medical professionals
 
02:23:57.950 --> 02:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
adherent to widely accepted standards of
 
02:24:00.530 --> 02:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
care nothing could be more Central to
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
your role as a parent than making those
 
02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
Health Care decisions for your child
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
second I want to establish that there is
 
02:24:10.429 --> 02:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
an equal protection issue the 14th
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment of the U.S Constitution as
 
02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
well as the New Hampshire Constitution
 
02:24:15.889 --> 02:24:15.899 align:start position:0%
prohibit discrimination against a class
 
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
of people if that just if that
 
02:24:20.330 --> 02:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
discrimination is irrational or
 
02:24:23.030 --> 02:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh you know violates the
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
rights of a protected group in seconds
 
02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
and so um transgender people are a class
 
02:24:30.170 --> 02:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
of people who are singled out by this
 
02:24:31.910 --> 02:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislation and denied access to health
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
care and by targeting that group of
 
02:24:35.389 --> 02:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
people the legislation is
 
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I'm happy to take any
 
02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:38.630 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I'm happy to take any
questions

02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%

the chair recognizes Kimberly Hester
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%

conversation with their doctors family

and caregivers
 
02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
the core of this bill is to seek to
 
02:25:21.410 --> 02:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
instill fear and Levy criminal penalties
 
02:25:23.870 --> 02:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
at parents and medical professionals who
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%

02:25:39.050 --> 02:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
rights of parents while seeking to
 
02:25:41.630 --> 02:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
threaten teachers for being safe spaces
 
02:25:44.030 --> 02:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
for Children and Youth are at the same
 
02:25:46.910 --> 02:25:46.920 align:start position:0%

decisions for the Health and Welfare of
 
02:25:51.590 --> 02:25:51.600 align:start position:0%

providing that medical care that for too
 
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
many of our kids and youth is the
 
02:26:07.730 --> 02:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
difference between life and death
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%

02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
the ignorance and hatred and simply
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
leave the medical decisions up to the
 
02:26:25.250 --> 02:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
medical professionals and parents and
 
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
caregivers as they do what is needed for
 
02:26:29.330 --> 02:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
their children together
 
02:26:31.490 --> 02:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
providing the best medical and mental
 
02:26:33.770 --> 02:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
health care for anyone is never a crime
 
02:26:36.290 --> 02:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
and should not be treated as such
 
02:26:38.809 --> 02:26:38.819 align:start position:0%
remember our state motto Live Free or
 
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%

02:26:45.290 --> 02:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
those who care for them and stay out of
 
02:26:48.110 --> 02:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
their health care and simply say no to
 
02:26:52.250 --> 02:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:03.170 --> 02:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:06.770 --> 02:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
hey I'm here to testify in opposition to
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
HB 417 uh before I get deeply personal
 
02:27:11.090 --> 02:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk for a moment about the
 
02:27:12.530 --> 02:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
economy because I'm told people care
 
02:27:13.969 --> 02:27:13.979 align:start position:0%
about it remember you have two minutes
 
02:27:15.620 --> 02:27:15.630 align:start position:0%
total yep
 
02:27:15.630 --> 02:27:16.790 align:start position:0%
total yep
[Music]

02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:17.510 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:19.250 --> 02:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a booming Technical
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
and scientific sector I have a highly
 
02:27:24.590 --> 02:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
skilled job within this field and could
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
have worked in any state I chose I chose
 
02:27:28.670 --> 02:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
to move to New Hampshire in no small
 
02:27:31.010 --> 02:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
part because it's a Haven where my
 
02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
family can be safe if this bill passes
 
02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
and I one day have a trans child I would
 
02:27:38.929 --> 02:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
choose their life over my job most of my
 
02:27:40.130 --> 02:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
colleagues are allies to the trans
 
02:27:42.170 --> 02:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
community and I believe they would make
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
the same choice this bill would
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely create a massive brain drain
 
02:27:48.290 --> 02:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire damage our property tax
 
02:27:50.090 --> 02:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
base and make the lives of everyone
 
02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
worse but now on to the real problems
 
02:27:53.690 --> 02:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
I have a dear friend whose information
 
02:27:56.690 --> 02:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to share for obvious
 
02:27:58.370 --> 02:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
reasons because an amazing trans
 
02:27:59.750 --> 02:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
daughter who I met this Summer She's
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
vibrant joyful and happy as any teenager
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully can be
 
02:28:06.050 --> 02:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes my friend will be
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
faced with a choice option A she can
 
02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
stop providing her child with access to
 
02:28:11.450 --> 02:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
gender performing care a choice she
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
tells me would almost certainly make her
 
02:28:15.950 --> 02:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
daughter suicidal option b she could
 
02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
continue to provide access to care for
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
her daughter covertly and risk losing
 
02:28:21.650 --> 02:28:21.660 align:start position:0%
her child altogether to the Foster
 
02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
system do not let anyone tell you that
 
02:28:27.349 --> 02:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
the Foster system will not steal kids if
 
02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed
 
02:28:31.250 --> 02:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
if this does happen
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
that transgender daughters care her
 
02:28:36.889 --> 02:28:36.899 align:start position:0%
health care is even worse she could lose
 
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
her parents and her health care at the
 
02:28:40.849 --> 02:28:40.859 align:start position:0%
same time and the third option is flee
 
02:28:42.770 --> 02:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
the state all these options in the same
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
place one less human who is transgender
 
02:28:48.170 --> 02:28:48.180 align:start position:0%
getting to live their free life will
 
02:28:49.969 --> 02:28:49.979 align:start position:0%
free of State violence in New Hampshire
 
02:28:52.250 --> 02:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
there's no mincing words the impact of
 
02:28:54.530 --> 02:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
this bill would be to kill trans kids in
 
02:28:56.750 --> 02:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or force them to flee it
 
02:28:58.910 --> 02:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
wants to get trans kids out of this
 
02:29:02.090 --> 02:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
state it is exterminationist it is
 
02:29:02.100 --> 02:29:03.290 align:start position:0%
state it is exterminationist it is
gender

02:29:03.290 --> 02:29:03.300 align:start position:0%

I'll be done
 
02:29:15.650 --> 02:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:39.650 --> 02:29:39.660 align:start position:0%

02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm also 30 years old and
 
02:29:47.150 --> 02:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
I identify as gender fluid and trans I'm
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
testifying in opposition to HB 417 the
 
02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
bill before you today proposes to call
 
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
accepting and loving parents abusive for
 
02:29:56.510 --> 02:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
supporting their children in their
 
02:29:58.490 --> 02:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
gender expression I would like to tell
 
02:29:59.870 --> 02:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
you my story of coming out to my family
 
02:30:02.090 --> 02:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
and how that's affected them to this day
 
02:30:03.950 --> 02:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
my first experience with questioning
 
02:30:05.570 --> 02:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
gender identity actually came from my
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
cousin coming out as a trans woman when
 
02:30:10.490 --> 02:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
I was 13 and she was the same age she
 
02:30:12.650 --> 02:30:12.660 align:start position:0%
came out to me on MySpace she ended the
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
letter with I understand if you don't
 
02:30:16.309 --> 02:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
consider me family anymore I completely
 
02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
offered my support because she was right
 
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
Jenna was a woman
 
02:30:22.730 --> 02:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
three years later an English class the
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
topic of trans people was brought up
 
02:30:27.770 --> 02:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
alongside intersex folk a born class
 
02:30:29.630 --> 02:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
tried to say it was unnatural and I was
 
02:30:32.270 --> 02:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
able to tell him how wrong he was fast
 
02:30:34.429 --> 02:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
forward to 2016 I'm working on college
 
02:30:36.290 --> 02:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
campuses and I have the opportunity to
 
02:30:38.570 --> 02:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
learn that transgender isn't just the
 
02:30:41.809 --> 02:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
binary male to female or vice versa that
 
02:30:43.849 --> 02:30:43.859 align:start position:0%
I had thought there was non-binary
 
02:30:45.889 --> 02:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
agender and what ended up making self
 
02:30:48.889 --> 02:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
making sense for myself as gender fluid
 
02:30:51.290 --> 02:30:51.300 align:start position:0%
next came to him telling my family I
 
02:30:52.969 --> 02:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
remember calling my sister and asking if
 
02:30:54.590 --> 02:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
she'd still love me and making the words
 
02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
my cousin had used a decade before she
 
02:30:58.969 --> 02:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
said of course she just didn't know what
 
02:31:01.010 --> 02:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
advice she could offer I told my mom
 
02:31:02.690 --> 02:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
while sitting on the beach completely
 
02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
unplanned she was understandably
 
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
confused by the terms but accepted it
 
02:31:08.450 --> 02:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
and has done her best to stay educated
 
02:31:11.270 --> 02:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
on gender identity finally it was my dad
 
02:31:13.969 --> 02:31:13.979 align:start position:0%
he was I he's Irish Catholic and one I
 
02:31:15.230 --> 02:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
was most worried about having been
 
02:31:17.330 --> 02:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
Daddy's girl my entire life
 
02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
we were in his truck moving some things
 
02:31:21.469 --> 02:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
to my new apartment and I just blurted
 
02:31:22.370 --> 02:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
it out
 
02:31:24.770 --> 02:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
I was able to explain that I always felt
 
02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere in between but definitely not
 
02:31:28.429 --> 02:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
just a girl I said I know you love me
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to be scared to tell
 
02:31:31.849 --> 02:31:31.859 align:start position:0%
you spoiler alert my whole family loves
 
02:31:34.610 --> 02:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
me exactly as I am and supports me
 
02:31:37.070 --> 02:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
now my dad uses titles like first of my
 
02:31:39.170 --> 02:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
Offspring when referring to me my mom
 
02:31:41.809 --> 02:31:41.819 align:start position:0%
loves being the educator for other folks
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
about queer terms they're not always
 
02:31:45.950 --> 02:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
perfect but they're always trying when
 
02:31:47.150 --> 02:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
my parents friends come to them
 
02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
wondering how they handle me being me uh
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
they simply answer with they love me
 
02:31:54.650 --> 02:31:54.660 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
02:31:57.170 --> 02:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
I don't think they know how many lives
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
they've saved by being accepting of me
 
02:32:01.010 --> 02:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
and letting people see that you got 15
 
02:32:03.710 --> 02:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
seconds please wrapping up uh granted I
 
02:32:05.150 --> 02:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
came out a lot later than the parameters
 
02:32:07.250 --> 02:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
of this bill partly because I didn't
 
02:32:08.690 --> 02:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
know there was anything else I could be
 
02:32:10.849 --> 02:32:10.859 align:start position:0%
I probably wouldn't have been as
 
02:32:12.530 --> 02:32:12.540 align:start position:0%
eloquent even though I wasn't to begin
 
02:32:14.809 --> 02:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
with and my parents even more confused
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
but I know the result would be the same
 
02:32:19.370 --> 02:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
and that is not abuse uh as such I urge
 
02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
you to oppose HB 417. thank you so much
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
should I wait no okay
 
02:32:50.330 --> 02:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
my name is Abby Maxwell I'm here
 
02:32:52.250 --> 02:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
representing myself speaking in
 
02:32:57.050 --> 02:32:57.060 align:start position:0%
opposition to HBO HB 417 my daughter is
 
02:32:59.750 --> 02:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
10 years old when she was born we
 
02:33:01.309 --> 02:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
thought she was a boy
 
02:33:03.230 --> 02:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
she spent ages three four and five
 
02:33:05.570 --> 02:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
begging for long hair and dresses but we
 
02:33:07.969 --> 02:33:07.979 align:start position:0%
lived in a small town where already she
 
02:33:10.490 --> 02:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
was mocked for her pink shoes my husband
 
02:33:12.830 --> 02:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to protect her so we said
 
02:33:15.830 --> 02:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
no when she was six she asked me if it
 
02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
was illegal for her to wear a dress I
 
02:33:21.650 --> 02:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
still remember how I froze horrified by
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
the impression I was giving my child I
 
02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
called my mother that day and together
 
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
we sewed the Halloween costume my child
 
02:33:30.770 --> 02:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
had been begging for for years she would
 
02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
be a witch in a dress
 
02:33:35.090 --> 02:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
that costume was the First dress my
 
02:33:36.830 --> 02:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
daughter ever got to wear but it was
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
just a costume by winter of that year
 
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
she was banging her head against the
 
02:33:43.370 --> 02:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
wall insisting that she could not go out
 
02:33:46.309 --> 02:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
in boy clothes she was staying up crying
 
02:33:48.650 --> 02:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
half the night and then one day as we
 
02:33:50.450 --> 02:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
drove to visit my mother my child said
 
02:33:52.370 --> 02:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
from the back seat that she did not want
 
02:33:55.370 --> 02:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
to exist anymore if I kept making her
 
02:33:56.929 --> 02:33:56.939 align:start position:0%
live as a boy
 
02:33:59.450 --> 02:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
finally I woke up to the suffering I was
 
02:34:02.210 --> 02:34:02.220 align:start position:0%
causing my child and I sought help my
 
02:34:03.889 --> 02:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
husband daughter and I visited the best
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
Children's Hospital in New England there
 
02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
we learned about transgender children
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
and how to care for them my husband and
 
02:34:13.370 --> 02:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
I were scared but we knew that we had to
 
02:34:15.530 --> 02:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
follow the research and Trust the
 
02:34:15.540 --> 02:34:16.849 align:start position:0%
follow the research and Trust the
experts

02:34:16.849 --> 02:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
experts
 
02:34:18.889 --> 02:34:18.899 align:start position:0%
soon after that appointment we finally
 
02:34:20.510 --> 02:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
let our daughter change her name and
 
02:34:23.210 --> 02:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
pronouns I'm not exaggerating when I say
 
02:34:25.790 --> 02:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
that she transformed overnight a weight
 
02:34:27.889 --> 02:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
she had carried her entire life fell off
 
02:34:29.870 --> 02:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
her shoulders and a light came on inside
 
02:34:32.990 --> 02:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
of her everyone saw it
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know what care my daughter will
 
02:34:37.730 --> 02:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
need in the future but if this bill were
 
02:34:40.190 --> 02:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
to pass it would not only mean that the
 
02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
life-saving option of puberty blockers
 
02:34:44.690 --> 02:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
would be banned it would also mean that
 
02:34:46.969 --> 02:34:46.979 align:start position:0%
her therapist could not affirm her as a
 
02:34:49.490 --> 02:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
girl her primary care doctor could not
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
it would mean that we would have to
 
02:34:53.570 --> 02:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
leave please wrap it up your overtime
 
02:34:56.030 --> 02:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
now sure I spent my entire life thinking
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
about these bills with all due respect
 
02:35:00.110 --> 02:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
you cannot imagine the amount of time
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
this takes out of my life so I will take
 
02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
about 30 more seconds no you're finished
 
02:35:08.690 --> 02:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:11.690 --> 02:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes Candace Moulton
 
02:35:14.210 --> 02:35:14.220 align:start position:0%

is currently about the same length as
mine

02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
mine
 
02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:24.469 align:start position:0%

I love him and I would have to if this
 
02:36:33.290 --> 02:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
if this bill was to go through I would
 
02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
have to not buy him the toys that he
 
02:36:38.450 --> 02:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
wants Maybe
 
02:36:40.429 --> 02:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what it would look like
 
02:36:43.550 --> 02:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis but I do know just
 
02:36:45.290 --> 02:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
as a parent like if I'm going to give
 
02:36:47.809 --> 02:36:47.819 align:start position:0%
him a hundred dollars to spend for his
 
02:36:51.590 --> 02:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
birthday like why if he wants if he
 
02:36:55.429 --> 02:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
wants lol toys my only concern as the
 
02:36:57.230 --> 02:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
financer of his birthday gifts is that
 
02:36:58.849 --> 02:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
he's going to play with whatever he asks
 
02:37:01.190 --> 02:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
me to buy to be honest
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
um I just don't want to like buy
 
02:37:04.130 --> 02:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
something that he's just never going to
 
02:37:07.309 --> 02:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
play with so uh
 
02:37:10.730 --> 02:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
honestly whatever makes him happy is
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
what I want to do as a mom
 
02:37:17.389 --> 02:37:17.399 align:start position:0%

02:37:17.399 --> 02:37:18.469 align:start position:0%
um so whatever he enjoys is fine to be
honest

02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%

somewhere to store it in uh in our house

so uh I just want to give this
 
02:37:34.429 --> 02:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
perspective as as a mom whose child is
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
still developing their gender identity
 
02:37:41.150 --> 02:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
um 10 seconds please thank you uh just
 
02:37:43.550 --> 02:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
that I I would feel that it would be in
 
02:37:47.870 --> 02:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
his best interest to affirm whatever he
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
wants to be
 
02:37:51.950 --> 02:37:51.960 align:start position:0%

speak to you today my name is Christine
 
02:38:10.429 --> 02:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
hegarty I have been here before
 
02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I am strongly opposed hb417
 
02:38:16.610 --> 02:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
as a parent of a trans child who just
 
02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
happened to turn 18 yesterday
 
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
I am absolutely appalled offended and
 
02:38:26.030 --> 02:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
distressed that I could be considered as
 
02:38:28.130 --> 02:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
a child abuser
 
02:38:30.290 --> 02:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
this bill is dangerous for all children
 
02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
but especially for those seeking gender
 
02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
affirming care
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
there is more abuse happening in
 
02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
families where parents cannot understand
 
02:38:40.130 --> 02:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
or support their children's call for
 
02:38:40.140 --> 02:38:41.389 align:start position:0%
or support their children's call for
help

02:38:41.389 --> 02:38:41.399 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
I have worked very hard to pay attention
 
02:38:48.110 --> 02:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
learn and understand who my child is
 
02:38:51.230 --> 02:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
the parents who do not take the time
 
02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
take the same care are the ones that are
 
02:38:55.750 --> 02:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
damaging the lives of their children
 
02:38:59.210 --> 02:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
they are the the abusers
 
02:39:01.429 --> 02:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
getting Medical Care and mental health
 
02:39:04.130 --> 02:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
guidance is the best scenario for kids
 
02:39:06.410 --> 02:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
who are questioning or struggling to
 
02:39:08.690 --> 02:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
live their lives and there are so many
 
02:39:10.849 --> 02:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
that do not have access
 
02:39:13.250 --> 02:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
or adults that can support them in
 
02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
finding it
 
02:39:17.450 --> 02:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
how in the world could you accuse
 
02:39:21.110 --> 02:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
parents in this case of child abuse
 
02:39:24.170 --> 02:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
my daughter was so lucky so I have been
 
02:39:27.710 --> 02:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
told many times over to have her dad and
 
02:39:32.090 --> 02:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
I as parents we have not pushed her to
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
be anyone other than who she truly is
 
02:39:37.849 --> 02:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
we have let her guide us in this process
 
02:39:40.130 --> 02:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
since she was four years old I've been
 
02:39:43.849 --> 02:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:45.889 --> 02:39:45.899 align:start position:0%
you might think a six-year-old would not
 
02:39:48.530 --> 02:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
be capable of communicating their needs
 
02:39:50.690 --> 02:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
but just as a child who scrapes their
 
02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
knee or Cuts their finger can scream in
 
02:39:56.210 --> 02:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
pain so can a child who is struggling
 
02:40:00.410 --> 02:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
with gender dysphoria good thank you
 
02:40:03.889 --> 02:40:03.899 align:start position:0%

02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
endanger families who are actually
 
02:40:10.010 --> 02:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
caring and protecting these most
 
02:40:12.110 --> 02:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children

State of New Hampshire
 
02:40:52.429 --> 02:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
I come before you to testify on H before
 
02:40:58.550 --> 02:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
17 and in support of HB sub 417 while a
 
02:41:00.710 --> 02:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
truly believe parents were gifted with
 
02:41:02.990 --> 02:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility to govern in the Affairs
 
02:41:05.630 --> 02:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
of their children in their care actions
 
02:41:07.429 --> 02:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
by the legislature and executive
 
02:41:10.070 --> 02:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
branches of New Hampshire have literally
 
02:41:13.790 --> 02:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
thrown a monkey Ranch into the works
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
through their actions in 2019 and
 
02:41:19.250 --> 02:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
codifying the existence of other than
 
02:41:21.530 --> 02:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
biological male and female in the
 
02:41:24.770 --> 02:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
recognition of gender identity
 
02:41:28.150 --> 02:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
this action causes a Pandora's Box
 
02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
allowing parents to make the decision to
 
02:41:34.730 --> 02:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
alter by chemical or surgical means the
 
02:41:37.490 --> 02:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
natural biological sex of their child
 
02:41:39.950 --> 02:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
some of the unintended consequences of
 
02:41:42.050 --> 02:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
this decision are suicide lifelong
 
02:41:44.570 --> 02:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
dependency on Pharmaceuticals depression
 
02:41:47.570 --> 02:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
and other psychological maladies in this
 
02:41:49.610 --> 02:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
situation it is my opinion that such
 
02:41:52.610 --> 02:41:52.620 align:start position:0%
action is child abuse so when the
 
02:41:55.849 --> 02:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
situation is the right of the parents to
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
cause confusion and physical harm to one
 
02:42:01.309 --> 02:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
or more of their natural born or Court
 
02:42:04.429 --> 02:42:04.439 align:start position:0%
granted children I submit this testimony
 
02:42:07.250 --> 02:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
and ask you to support 4-17 I would also
 
02:42:09.770 --> 02:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
like to address a question that was
 
02:42:13.730 --> 02:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
posed to representative Pearson early
 
02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:15.190 align:start position:0%
posed to representative Pearson early
um

02:42:15.190 --> 02:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:18.770 --> 02:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
approximately 92 percent of children who
 
02:42:21.950 --> 02:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
are confused in their gender identity as
 
02:42:25.130 --> 02:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
a child growing up by the time they meet
 
02:42:28.630 --> 02:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
reach puberty have changed that opinion
 
02:42:31.550 --> 02:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
Additionally the American College of
 
02:42:34.250 --> 02:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
Pediatricians also supports this as
 
02:42:36.770 --> 02:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
being child abuse and I have one more
 
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
quick thing to say to you because like
 
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
15 seconds certainly uh the
 
02:42:47.349 --> 02:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
um excuse me puberty blockers
 
02:42:52.730 --> 02:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
and sex hormones do not have FD the U.S
 
02:42:55.550 --> 02:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
Food and Drug Administration FDA
 
02:42:57.130 --> 02:42:57.140 align:start position:0%
approval for children
 
02:43:00.830 --> 02:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
for gender care no clinical trials have
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
established this precise their safety
 
02:43:09.050 --> 02:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
and such labeled use and there are no
 
02:43:11.870 --> 02:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
long-term studies that show us what's
 
02:43:13.610 --> 02:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
going to happen in the future in these
 
02:43:16.490 --> 02:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
children think thank you very much and
 
02:43:18.710 --> 02:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
with that I end the hearing on this bill
 
02:43:20.750 --> 02:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
there are no more pink cards in my
 
02:43:26.030 --> 02:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:28.849 --> 02:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
there was a question for represent for
 
02:43:31.130 --> 02:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
Miss testerman I'm sorry
 
02:43:34.370 --> 02:43:34.380 align:start position:0%

02:43:40.429 --> 02:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
I do apologize for that
 
02:43:42.469 --> 02:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
yes so as you heard when we have
 
02:43:44.510 --> 02:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
statistics we do like to see what what's
 
02:43:46.309 --> 02:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
your source for that so you said 92
 
02:43:47.870 --> 02:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
percent changed their mind or whatever
 
02:43:50.210 --> 02:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
what's your source for that please
 
02:43:52.610 --> 02:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
I would have to research that again for
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
you I just know it from the back of my
 
02:43:58.370 --> 02:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
my other research that I've done I am
 
02:44:01.250 --> 02:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
also a microbiology trained person so I
 
02:44:04.010 --> 02:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
do do a lot of research thank you
 
02:44:07.190 --> 02:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
I can get that to you thank you okay now
 
02:44:12.410 --> 02:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:09.410 --> 03:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
is call you to an on Deck Circle so you
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
can walk down and be ready to testify
 
03:43:16.670 --> 03:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
when the person testifying is finished
 
03:43:19.490 --> 03:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
so if you wish to go down to 201 203
 
03:43:26.690 --> 03:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:30.170 --> 03:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
we are sorry that both reps Hall and the
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
ice arena in Manchester are occupied at
 
03:44:43.849 --> 03:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:46.729 --> 03:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
committee members coming around is an
 
03:44:48.590 --> 03:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill could you all pay
 
03:44:51.769 --> 03:44:51.779 align:start position:0%
attention it is an amended version of
 
03:44:53.389 --> 03:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
the bill which is really what they
 
03:44:55.910 --> 03:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
wanted in the beginning and so the
 
03:44:58.790 --> 03:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
reason I'm giving it to you is there may
 
03:45:01.370 --> 03:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
be you may have a comment and if you're
 
03:45:03.410 --> 03:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
commenting on the original Bill the
 
03:45:05.450 --> 03:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
language may not be in the original bill
 
03:45:08.349 --> 03:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
so you know it's sincere but it's
 
03:45:11.630 --> 03:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
useless so we're going to try to work
 
03:45:15.650 --> 03:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
anybody who just came in who does not
 
03:45:21.170 --> 03:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
have a seat either you will be standing
 
03:45:23.150 --> 03:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
for the next several hours or there is
 
03:45:26.450 --> 03:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
an overflow room in 201 203 that will
 
03:45:29.510 --> 03:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
have this hearing piped in there
 
03:45:39.170 --> 03:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:42.410 --> 03:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:44.750 --> 03:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
03:45:46.010 --> 03:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
I can't
 
03:45:46.020 --> 03:46:23.330 align:start position:0%
I can't
well

03:46:23.330 --> 03:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:26.809 --> 03:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:41.809 --> 03:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:44.030 --> 03:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
you have lots of piles I don't want it
 
03:46:50.570 --> 03:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:54.349 --> 03:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
if you were here for hearing on 417 that
 
03:46:57.469 --> 03:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
was opened and continued and closed this
 
03:46:59.990 --> 03:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
morning we plan on rescheduling that for
 
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.429 --> 03:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman can you repeat that those of
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:31.090 --> 03:47:31.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:34.729 --> 03:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
okay what's the one we didn't do
 
03:47:37.690 --> 03:47:37.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:39.769 --> 03:47:39.779 align:start position:0%

03:48:29.520 --> 03:48:33.349 align:start position:0%
 
commitment

03:48:33.349 --> 03:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:38.110 --> 03:48:38.120 align:start position:0%

03:50:09.769 --> 03:50:09.779 align:start position:0%
and recognize the Speaker of the House
 
03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:26.870 --> 03:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
the committee members should have
 
03:50:31.070 --> 03:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
received the desired presentation of the
 
03:50:33.550 --> 03:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
bill which is an amendment
 
03:50:37.010 --> 03:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
720 this is important for you to know
 
03:50:41.150 --> 03:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
now so if you ask questions based on the
 
03:50:44.150 --> 03:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
old version and those words are not in
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
the new version you didn't need to do
 
03:50:48.830 --> 03:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
that so this is how you know
 
03:50:50.450 --> 03:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
03:50:52.370 --> 03:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
03:50:52.380 --> 03:50:54.190 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
committee

03:50:54.190 --> 03:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
as you just pointed out Mr chairman this
 
03:50:59.870 --> 03:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
is the final version
 
03:50:59.880 --> 03:51:00.710 align:start position:0%
is the final version
um

03:51:00.710 --> 03:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:04.130 --> 03:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're requesting that
 
03:51:07.250 --> 03:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
the committee take up and vote on uh the
 
03:51:09.050 --> 03:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
original version that you have in front
 
03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
of you the original bill that was filed
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
was a placeholder and uh
 
03:51:17.450 --> 03:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
it's gone this has gone through numerous
 
03:51:19.490 --> 03:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
different uh
 
03:51:23.330 --> 03:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
layers that I will explain
 
03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman
 
03:51:28.790 --> 03:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time understanding why
 
03:51:32.210 --> 03:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
any legislator or parent be against this
 
03:51:32.220 --> 03:51:34.849 align:start position:0%
any legislator or parent be against this
legislation

03:51:34.849 --> 03:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:36.650 --> 03:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
parents are responsible for the
 
03:51:38.929 --> 03:51:38.939 align:start position:0%
upbringing of their own children
 
03:51:41.229 --> 03:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
with the help and support of government
 
03:51:43.969 --> 03:51:43.979 align:start position:0%
not the opposite
 
03:51:46.670 --> 03:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
that's what hb10 protects
 
03:51:48.889 --> 03:51:48.899 align:start position:0%
protects parents rights and the ability
 
03:51:51.410 --> 03:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
to be 100 involved in their children's
 
03:51:54.050 --> 03:51:54.060 align:start position:0%
daily lives
 
03:51:55.969 --> 03:51:55.979 align:start position:0%
came close to passing a similar Bill
 
03:51:57.710 --> 03:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:51:59.690 --> 03:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
we went to work on it
 
03:52:01.370 --> 03:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
and have spent months working with
 
03:52:05.210 --> 03:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
Advocates legal experts and parents
 
03:52:07.969 --> 03:52:07.979 align:start position:0%
this result was Common Sense legislation
 
03:52:09.950 --> 03:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
that protects the rights of parents
 
03:52:12.050 --> 03:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
while supporting our most vulnerable
 
03:52:14.510 --> 03:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
population our children
 
03:52:16.790 --> 03:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
this builds products of months of
 
03:52:16.800 --> 03:52:18.349 align:start position:0%
this builds products of months of
collaboration

03:52:18.349 --> 03:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
03:52:20.030 --> 03:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
with the Senate and the Attorney
 
03:52:21.650 --> 03:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
General's office
 
03:52:23.809 --> 03:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
and it is the fourth version of this
 
03:52:23.819 --> 03:52:26.570 align:start position:0%
and it is the fourth version of this
bill

03:52:26.570 --> 03:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:28.910 --> 03:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
in a recent poll
 
03:52:31.969 --> 03:52:31.979 align:start position:0%
of 1 000 New Hampshire voters taken last
 
03:52:31.979 --> 03:52:32.769 align:start position:0%
of 1 000 New Hampshire voters taken last
month

03:52:32.769 --> 03:52:32.779 align:start position:0%
month
 
03:52:35.150 --> 03:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
respondents Joan parents over state
 
03:52:37.849 --> 03:52:37.859 align:start position:0%
employees to have the final say of what
 
03:52:39.769 --> 03:52:39.779 align:start position:0%
their children are taught nearly two to
 
03:52:42.110 --> 03:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
one margin
 
03:52:44.150 --> 03:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
when pacifically asked about schools
 
03:52:46.790 --> 03:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
keeping students behavior regarding sex
 
03:52:50.030 --> 03:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
and gender secret 78 supported the
 
03:52:52.370 --> 03:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
parents right to know
 
03:52:55.250 --> 03:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
we support parents right to know what is
 
03:52:56.750 --> 03:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
happening to their children when in
 
03:52:56.760 --> 03:52:57.889 align:start position:0%
happening to their children when in
school

03:52:57.889 --> 03:52:57.899 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:52:59.929 --> 03:52:59.939 align:start position:0%
and I and many others believe parents
 
03:53:02.030 --> 03:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
make the best decision for their
 
03:53:02.040 --> 03:53:04.010 align:start position:0%
make the best decision for their
families

03:53:04.010 --> 03:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
families
 
03:53:06.769 --> 03:53:06.779 align:start position:0%
I'm a father
 
03:53:09.769 --> 03:53:09.779 align:start position:0%
I had a daughter in school
 
03:53:11.690 --> 03:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
and I certainly would have wanted to
 
03:53:16.070 --> 03:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
know what was happening in school with
 
03:53:18.229 --> 03:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
my child
 
03:53:20.389 --> 03:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
we support the parents who want to be
 
03:53:21.950 --> 03:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
involved in their children's lives and
 
03:53:26.750 --> 03:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:29.389 --> 03:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
rhetoric perpetuates that lie that
 
03:53:31.670 --> 03:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
school Personnel no more than we do and
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
what is best for our children
 
03:53:37.010 --> 03:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
it was a time when parents were being
 
03:53:38.990 --> 03:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
labeled as terrorists and being attacked
 
03:53:42.050 --> 03:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
simply for wanting basic transparency
 
03:53:43.910 --> 03:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
this happened in many of the school
 
03:53:45.410 --> 03:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
district meetings
 
03:53:49.670 --> 03:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
some which I attended in my local town
 
03:53:51.170 --> 03:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
opponents of this bill say the
 
03:53:54.050 --> 03:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
legislation is dangerous and harmful
 
03:53:56.570 --> 03:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
what is dangerous and harmful is not
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
having parents involved in their
 
03:53:59.570 --> 03:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
children's lives
 
03:54:01.729 --> 03:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
in future
 
03:54:05.090 --> 03:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
the first line of the bill it says the
 
03:54:06.889 --> 03:54:06.899 align:start position:0%
general court affirms that it's a
 
03:54:08.870 --> 03:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
fundamental right of parents
 
03:54:11.389 --> 03:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
to direct the upbringing Education and
 
03:54:13.610 --> 03:54:13.620 align:start position:0%
Care of children
 
03:54:16.370 --> 03:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
their children show me what is dangerous
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
the only thing dangerous and harmful is
 
03:54:24.650 --> 03:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
believing that parents are not ever
 
03:54:26.929 --> 03:54:26.939 align:start position:0%
right to protect their own children
 
03:54:29.450 --> 03:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
parents deserve transparency and hb10
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
provides a protection they deserve to
 
03:54:31.199 --> 03:54:33.229 align:start position:0%
provides a protection they deserve to
have

03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:54:35.630 --> 03:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I will not be taking any
 
03:54:37.309 --> 03:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
questions and I will let representative
 
03:54:39.910 --> 03:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
Grayson who is the original sponsor
 
03:54:43.250 --> 03:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
dissect the bill for the members he is
 
03:54:45.590 --> 03:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
much more knowledgeable about it than I
 
03:54:47.929 --> 03:54:47.939 align:start position:0%
admit I am
 
03:54:51.469 --> 03:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
I was a prime sponsor of this bill
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
because I truly believe
 
03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
that is the parents not the state who
 
03:54:58.670 --> 03:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
should be responsible for the upbringing
 
03:55:01.130 --> 03:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
of these children of our children
 
03:55:03.950 --> 03:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
I truly believe this is one of the most
 
03:55:06.530 --> 03:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
important issues of our time and we must
 
03:55:09.290 --> 03:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
keep parents completely involved in
 
03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:16.389 --> 03:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
with that Mr chairman uh I will let
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
representative Grayson dissect the bill
 
03:55:21.469 --> 03:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
for you uh and that's why I've chosen
 
03:55:23.990 --> 03:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
not to take any questions thank you
 
03:55:25.790 --> 03:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker the chair
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Grayson and
 
03:55:30.650 --> 03:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
also representative Paul Terry who is
 
03:55:33.830 --> 03:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
one of the other co-sponsors and knows
 
03:55:37.969 --> 03:55:37.979 align:start position:0%
some details that representative Gleason
 
03:55:39.769 --> 03:55:39.779 align:start position:0%
says he doesn't know so it sounds like a
 
03:55:41.990 --> 03:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
good team those of you who are standing
 
03:55:46.550 --> 03:55:46.560 align:start position:0%

03:56:13.250 --> 03:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and committee
 
03:56:15.290 --> 03:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
members uh thank you for the opportunity
 
03:56:18.590 --> 03:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
I am privileged to introduce uh House
 
03:56:21.889 --> 03:56:21.899 align:start position:0%
Bill tend to follow uh the speaker in uh
 
03:56:24.769 --> 03:56:24.779 align:start position:0%
in introducing house bill 10. I do want
 
03:56:27.530 --> 03:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
to bring your attention primarily to the
 
03:56:30.290 --> 03:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
amendment 0720 this was supposed to be
 
03:56:31.969 --> 03:56:31.979 align:start position:0%
the original bill that you would have
 
03:56:34.010 --> 03:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
seen you never would have seen the other
 
03:56:37.130 --> 03:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
version uh and it's okay that you did
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
there's no secrets in there uh the
 
03:56:42.410 --> 03:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
amendment makes it more streamlined and
 
03:56:45.110 --> 03:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
it did go through a a more stringent
 
03:56:47.689 --> 03:56:47.699 align:start position:0%
vetting process to make sure that there
 
03:56:50.389 --> 03:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
were no conflicts with the Constitution
 
03:56:52.729 --> 03:56:52.739 align:start position:0%
or the or any other laws the attorney
 
03:56:56.330 --> 03:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
general has has reviewed it uh to to
 
03:56:58.969 --> 03:56:58.979 align:start position:0%
give us the uh the language that would
 
03:57:01.370 --> 03:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
be necessary and so what I do want to do
 
03:57:04.010 --> 03:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
is to just very quickly go through and
 
03:57:06.309 --> 03:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
show you highlight the the the
 
03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
differences the changes that you will
 
03:57:11.150 --> 03:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
see in the amendment versus the original
 
03:57:14.389 --> 03:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
copy that you have uh that way uh we
 
03:57:15.889 --> 03:57:15.899 align:start position:0%
don't we can avoid some questions that
 
03:57:18.410 --> 03:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
may not be pertinent to the bill
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh first of all there is a
 
03:57:26.689 --> 03:57:26.699 align:start position:0%
a section in the original version that
 
03:57:29.630 --> 03:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
defines compelling State interest
 
03:57:33.410 --> 03:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
that has been deleted from the amendment
 
03:57:36.290 --> 03:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
at the direction of the Attorney General
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
because the concept of compelling State
 
03:57:42.650 --> 03:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
interest is throughout our rsas every
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
judge every attorney understands that
 
03:57:47.990 --> 03:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
principle but to try to Define it in any
 
03:57:50.090 --> 03:57:50.100 align:start position:0%
one particular in in any one particular
 
03:57:52.189 --> 03:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation could potentially
 
03:57:55.389 --> 03:57:55.399 align:start position:0%
compromise is the definition in other
 
03:57:58.969 --> 03:57:58.979 align:start position:0%
aspects or in applications of the law so
 
03:58:01.130 --> 03:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
that become became problematic by trying
 
03:58:04.429 --> 03:58:04.439 align:start position:0%
to Define it too narrowly or being too
 
03:58:07.130 --> 03:58:07.140 align:start position:0%
broad and so that has been deleted but
 
03:58:09.349 --> 03:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
the expression or the phrase compelling
 
03:58:11.269 --> 03:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
State interest is still in there because
 
03:58:14.150 --> 03:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
that is an essential part of the
 
03:58:17.090 --> 03:58:17.100 align:start position:0%
government's uh ability or the power or
 
03:58:19.910 --> 03:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
the authority to infringe on anyone's
 
03:58:21.889 --> 03:58:21.899 align:start position:0%
rights regardless of the nature of those
 
03:58:23.809 --> 03:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
rights they have to have a compelling
 
03:58:25.070 --> 03:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
State interest
 
03:58:25.080 --> 03:58:26.830 align:start position:0%
State interest
secondly

03:58:26.830 --> 03:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
03:58:30.530 --> 03:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
a large portion of the of the original
 
03:58:33.950 --> 03:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
what is uh section I it's it's going to
 
03:58:36.710 --> 03:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
be on the original version page three uh
 
03:58:41.750 --> 03:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
beginning at line 25 section i5
 
03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
says School Board notifications of
 
03:58:45.710 --> 03:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
parental rights
 
03:58:48.650 --> 03:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
most of this entire section
 
03:58:52.370 --> 03:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:57.130 --> 03:58:57.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:05.450 --> 03:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:05.460 --> 03:59:07.189 align:start position:0%
 
925

03:59:07.189 --> 03:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
925
 
03:59:11.389 --> 03:59:11.399 align:start position:0%
uh that would be beginning at line 25
 
03:59:14.269 --> 03:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
that section the school board it goes
 
03:59:17.570 --> 03:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
out to just do to outline uh that the
 
03:59:19.070 --> 03:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
school board School District or school
 
03:59:20.150 --> 03:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
administrative unit child in
 
03:59:21.410 --> 03:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
consultation with parents teachers and
 
03:59:22.790 --> 03:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
administrators develop adopt and
 
03:59:25.189 --> 03:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
promulgate publicly a policy to promote
 
03:59:26.570 --> 03:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
parental involvement in the public
 
03:59:28.250 --> 03:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
school system and it goes out and
 
03:59:30.889 --> 03:59:30.899 align:start position:0%
outlines what those things might be
 
03:59:33.349 --> 03:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
there was a concern that this might
 
03:59:37.490 --> 03:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
inter become a an unfunded mandate it
 
03:59:40.309 --> 03:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't directly one but it could be
 
03:59:41.929 --> 03:59:41.939 align:start position:0%
perceived as being when we don't want to
 
03:59:44.269 --> 03:59:44.279 align:start position:0%
even come close to uh having that
 
03:59:46.849 --> 03:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
perception that it could be a 28-a
 
03:59:49.370 --> 03:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
violation so we eliminated that entire
 
03:59:51.110 --> 03:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
section it's and has actually not even
 
03:59:54.530 --> 03:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
necessary uh it makes the the law much
 
03:59:57.170 --> 03:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
more uh just longer than it needs to be
 
03:59:58.849 --> 03:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
and more and may perhaps even introduce
 
04:00:00.889 --> 04:00:00.899 align:start position:0%
some confusion into it so we don't want
 
04:00:02.450 --> 04:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
it to be confusing in any way and we
 
04:00:03.410 --> 04:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want there to be any
 
04:00:05.510 --> 04:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates which would violate
 
04:00:08.389 --> 04:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
the law so we deleted that out of the
 
04:00:10.790 --> 04:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
amended version so that's why the
 
04:00:13.309 --> 04:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
amended version is much shorter than the
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:21.050 --> 04:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
if you go to the section that is
 
04:00:23.510 --> 04:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
violations in the original is this the
 
04:00:25.429 --> 04:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
amended or the
 
04:00:28.910 --> 04:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's the of the
 
04:00:32.210 --> 04:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
of the original bill that section five
 
04:00:37.370 --> 04:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:37.380 --> 04:00:38.929 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:00:38.929 --> 04:00:38.939 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:00:43.550 --> 04:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:46.250 --> 04:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
section 7 is violations
 
04:00:49.610 --> 04:00:49.620 align:start position:0%
the original version page number uh page
 
04:00:52.010 --> 04:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
five of the amendment and page six of
 
04:00:59.630 --> 04:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:03.769 --> 04:01:03.779 align:start position:0%
in the original version it calls for
 
04:01:06.110 --> 04:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh in in Roman numeral one a violation
 
04:01:07.849 --> 04:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
of any provision of this chapter by an
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
individual shall constitute a Class A
 
04:01:11.330 --> 04:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and then it goes on to
 
04:01:14.210 --> 04:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
explain the violations
 
04:01:16.429 --> 04:01:16.439 align:start position:0%
in the amended version
 
04:01:20.929 --> 04:01:20.939 align:start position:0%
this class A misdemeanor is uh has been
 
04:01:24.769 --> 04:01:24.779 align:start position:0%
eliminated in The as a first offense we
 
04:01:26.630 --> 04:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
don't want we don't want teachers
 
04:01:26.640 --> 04:01:29.330 align:start position:0%
don't want we don't want teachers
accidentally

04:01:29.330 --> 04:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
accidentally
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
committing a crime and so to eliminate
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
the the potential for inadvertent
 
04:01:35.929 --> 04:01:35.939 align:start position:0%
Commission of a crime and then being
 
04:01:38.330 --> 04:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
having a Class A misdemeanor we made it
 
04:01:41.090 --> 04:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
an intentional on a repeated offense so
 
04:01:43.210 --> 04:01:43.220 align:start position:0%
if you'll notice the first offense
 
04:01:46.070 --> 04:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
becomes a civil action a right for of
 
04:01:49.309 --> 04:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
parents for civil action and then a
 
04:01:51.410 --> 04:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
repeat offense would then be subject to
 
04:01:54.530 --> 04:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
a class A misdemeanor for for a teacher
 
04:01:56.510 --> 04:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
who would intentionally violate on
 
04:01:58.969 --> 04:01:58.979 align:start position:0%
multiple offenses so and this is not
 
04:02:00.590 --> 04:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
unprecedented if you go through the
 
04:02:03.590 --> 04:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
statutes there's actually a a senior
 
04:02:05.510 --> 04:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
citizens Bill of Rights and if you
 
04:02:07.370 --> 04:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
violate the provisions of the senior
 
04:02:09.950 --> 04:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
citizens Bill of Rights that is a class
 
04:02:13.189 --> 04:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
A misdemeanor so it's not unprecedented
 
04:02:15.229 --> 04:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
for that to be a standard of punishment
 
04:02:17.809 --> 04:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
for violating the rights of someone as
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
in our statutes those are the the
 
04:02:22.969 --> 04:02:22.979 align:start position:0%
probably the the biggest changes oh
 
04:02:25.070 --> 04:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
actually and one other thing I do want
 
04:02:26.210 --> 04:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
to point out because I know this is
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
going to be hot button and so I'm going
 
04:02:30.349 --> 04:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
to be ready for the dark to come flying
 
04:02:32.750 --> 04:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
at me on these in these sections but if
 
04:02:38.570 --> 04:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
you go to the the section 169 I4 page uh
 
04:02:40.130 --> 04:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
let me get to that real quick that's
 
04:02:42.410 --> 04:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
going to begin on
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:51.469 --> 04:02:51.479 align:start position:0%
page three also continues until you get
 
04:02:54.650 --> 04:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
to page four and I want you to look at
 
04:02:57.309 --> 04:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
page four
 
04:03:03.889 --> 04:03:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:05.870 --> 04:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
hold on does everybody want to pay
 
04:03:09.070 --> 04:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:13.189 --> 04:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
points w x and y
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
points w x and y those are probably the
 
04:03:19.250 --> 04:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
most contentious of all of the of the
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
points everything else is explicitly
 
04:03:24.830 --> 04:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
stated in rsas already uh these are the
 
04:03:26.090 --> 04:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
only ones that don't have any other
 
04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
references in the rsas
 
04:03:31.729 --> 04:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
the original version uh we or the
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
amended version changes the original to
 
04:03:36.410 --> 04:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
include the clause in each of the three
 
04:03:39.650 --> 04:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
lines you'll see the Clause upon inquiry
 
04:03:41.870 --> 04:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
the concern that came up when the bill
 
04:03:44.809 --> 04:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
was first introduced last time was the
 
04:03:47.809 --> 04:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
if it if a if a student confides in a
 
04:03:47.819 --> 04:03:49.010 align:start position:0%
if it if a if a student confides in a
teacher

04:03:49.010 --> 04:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
04:03:52.130 --> 04:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
would the teacher then be compelled to
 
04:03:54.349 --> 04:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
call the parent immediately and inform
 
04:03:55.910 --> 04:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
the parent
 
04:03:57.769 --> 04:03:57.779 align:start position:0%
we want to have a good relationship
 
04:03:59.210 --> 04:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
between the students and the teachers
 
04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
but we also must have a good
 
04:04:02.750 --> 04:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
relationship between the children and
 
04:04:04.849 --> 04:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
the parents and the school and the
 
04:04:08.210 --> 04:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
parents so how do we do all that and to
 
04:04:09.830 --> 04:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
compel the teacher to then immediately
 
04:04:12.830 --> 04:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
inform the parents could could violate a
 
04:04:14.929 --> 04:04:14.939 align:start position:0%
trust a relationship that the the
 
04:04:17.269 --> 04:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
student may have with the with the
 
04:04:19.550 --> 04:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
teacher but it also we need to be sure
 
04:04:21.170 --> 04:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
and protect that relationship with the
 
04:04:23.689 --> 04:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
parent as well and so we put in upon
 
04:04:25.610 --> 04:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
inquiry on there which means that the
 
04:04:28.189 --> 04:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
parent would have to ask
 
04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
and then once the parent asks then the
 
04:04:32.929 --> 04:04:32.939 align:start position:0%
teacher would be required to inform
 
04:04:35.450 --> 04:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
what's happening that we see a lot of
 
04:04:38.150 --> 04:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
and I mean just this morning every day
 
04:04:40.429 --> 04:04:40.439 align:start position:0%
seems to be a new example of why this
 
04:04:42.590 --> 04:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
bill becomes necessary but just this
 
04:04:45.429 --> 04:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
morning I read of a School in Colorado
 
04:04:49.849 --> 04:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
where the assistant principal asked how
 
04:04:53.330 --> 04:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
do we deal with children that would come
 
04:04:56.330 --> 04:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
out as transgendered or gay or whatever
 
04:04:59.510 --> 04:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
anything it doesn't matter what it is uh
 
04:05:00.889 --> 04:05:00.899 align:start position:0%
it could be an eating disorder we don't
 
04:05:02.809 --> 04:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
know just how but it's specifically this
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
what happened to deal with with a
 
04:05:06.349 --> 04:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
transgender child
 
04:05:08.349 --> 04:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
but how do we
 
04:05:11.150 --> 04:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
address the situation where the parents
 
04:05:14.030 --> 04:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
have explicitly said
 
04:05:14.040 --> 04:05:16.490 align:start position:0%
have explicitly said
no

04:05:16.490 --> 04:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:05:18.410 --> 04:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
you will call my child by their birth
 
04:05:21.170 --> 04:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
name and the appropriate pronouns etc
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
etc the parents have explicitly said
 
04:05:25.309 --> 04:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
this is what you'll do but this the the
 
04:05:25.319 --> 04:05:26.689 align:start position:0%
this is what you'll do but this the the
schools

04:05:26.689 --> 04:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:05:31.309 --> 04:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
were not abiding by the parents wishes
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
so the assistant principal asked the
 
04:05:35.929 --> 04:05:35.939 align:start position:0%
question what do we do and the assistant
 
04:05:39.950 --> 04:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
principle was advised to lie to the
 
04:05:39.960 --> 04:05:41.150 align:start position:0%
principle was advised to lie to the
parents

04:05:41.150 --> 04:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
parents
 
04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
blatant lie to the parents you tell them
 
04:05:47.990 --> 04:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
you what you do is you address the
 
04:05:50.689 --> 04:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
student at school
 
04:05:52.670 --> 04:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
by the name they've chosen and the
 
04:05:54.769 --> 04:05:54.779 align:start position:0%
pronouns they've chosen but when the
 
04:05:57.290 --> 04:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
parents ask about it you lie and you
 
04:05:59.510 --> 04:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
tell them what they want to hear that's
 
04:06:01.790 --> 04:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
what was done and that is why
 
04:06:04.010 --> 04:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
a foundation that is built on lies will
 
04:06:07.309 --> 04:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
crumble you undermine the relationship
 
04:06:10.910 --> 04:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
between the the student the child
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
and their parents that's a natural
 
04:06:16.250 --> 04:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
relationship the the student teacher
 
04:06:17.830 --> 04:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
relationship is not a natural
 
04:06:20.269 --> 04:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
relationship the relationship between
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
the parent and the child is a natural
 
04:06:24.290 --> 04:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
relationship and you undermine that when
 
04:06:25.849 --> 04:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
you lie
 
04:06:27.650 --> 04:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
to the parents
 
04:06:29.870 --> 04:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
and so I would ask the kids
 
04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
next time somebody when you have an
 
04:06:34.610 --> 04:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity ask the teachers and the
 
04:06:36.349 --> 04:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
principals or anybody it doesn't matter
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
left or right or Center or whatever
 
04:06:43.429 --> 04:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
if you would lie to my parents how do I
 
04:06:46.429 --> 04:06:46.439 align:start position:0%
know you're not lying to me
 
04:06:49.490 --> 04:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
and so we are trying to protect the
 
04:06:52.729 --> 04:06:52.739 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the rent the parents child
 
04:06:56.150 --> 04:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
relationship protecting the children not
 
04:06:58.910 --> 04:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
from their parents
 
04:07:01.490 --> 04:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
protecting the children and protecting
 
04:07:04.490 --> 04:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
the parents rights to govern the all
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
those decisions that parents have to
 
04:07:08.809 --> 04:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
make regarding their children and so I
 
04:07:10.790 --> 04:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
will leave my those comments off there
 
04:07:12.769 --> 04:07:12.779 align:start position:0%
so that we can answer specific questions
 
04:07:15.229 --> 04:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
pertaining to the bill but one thing
 
04:07:17.150 --> 04:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
that is important to understand in this
 
04:07:20.330 --> 04:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
bill what this bill does not do none
 
04:07:20.340 --> 04:07:21.530 align:start position:0%
bill what this bill does not do none
whatsoever

04:07:21.530 --> 04:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
04:07:24.889 --> 04:07:24.899 align:start position:0%
this bill does not say a child cannot
 
04:07:24.899 --> 04:07:26.269 align:start position:0%
this bill does not say a child cannot
transition

04:07:26.269 --> 04:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
transition
 
04:07:28.610 --> 04:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
this does not say that the child cannot
 
04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
come out at school and be whatever
 
04:07:32.330 --> 04:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
whoever by called by whatever names or
 
04:07:34.849 --> 04:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
pronouns it doesn't matter that's not
 
04:07:36.349 --> 04:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it does not say they
 
04:07:37.969 --> 04:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
cannot do that they CA it doesn't say
 
04:07:40.370 --> 04:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
they can't join any particular clubs it
 
04:07:41.630 --> 04:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't say they can't they can't
 
04:07:43.309 --> 04:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
participate in any particular activities
 
04:07:46.670 --> 04:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
all it says is that they must have
 
04:07:49.250 --> 04:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
parental consent and knowledge
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm not really sure how that is
 
04:07:54.290 --> 04:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
harmful and dangerous and that would
 
04:07:57.650 --> 04:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
just as the as the speaker said how is
 
04:07:59.210 --> 04:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
that harmful and dangerous and I know
 
04:08:00.530 --> 04:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that's going to
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
come up because it came up last year
 
04:08:04.910 --> 04:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
what about the parents that would abuse
 
04:08:07.250 --> 04:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
their child because they found out well
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
we already have laws that deal with that
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
and if you will turn in the amended
 
04:08:14.030 --> 04:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
version and in the original version but
 
04:08:15.710 --> 04:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
in the amended version
 
04:08:19.429 --> 04:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
there is a section that says
 
04:08:22.010 --> 04:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's uh page four
 
04:08:26.929 --> 04:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:31.070 --> 04:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
this section does not authorize a parent
 
04:08:33.530 --> 04:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
of a minor child in this state to engage
 
04:08:36.650 --> 04:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
in conduct that is unlawful or to abuse
 
04:08:39.469 --> 04:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
or neglect his or her minor child in
 
04:08:42.290 --> 04:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
violation of General law
 
04:08:45.530 --> 04:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
this bill also does not restrict
 
04:08:47.570 --> 04:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
or or prevent
 
04:08:51.229 --> 04:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
those who are mandatory reporters of any
 
04:08:53.630 --> 04:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
suspicious or anything you might suspect
 
04:08:55.910 --> 04:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
is being abuse it doesn't prevent them
 
04:08:58.910 --> 04:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
from reporting that suspected abuse
 
04:09:01.490 --> 04:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
so it's not about what they what the
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
kids can and cannot do it's that they
 
04:09:04.849 --> 04:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
can and cannot do it without parental
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
permission and I think that's a pretty
 
04:09:08.090 --> 04:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
reasonable thing to do
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:14.210 --> 04:09:14.220 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond uh thank you Mr
 
04:09:15.530 --> 04:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you
 
04:09:17.389 --> 04:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
representatives for being here Mr
 
04:09:19.490 --> 04:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
chairman I would like to
 
04:09:21.950 --> 04:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
um ask for a bit of personal privilege
 
04:09:21.960 --> 04:09:22.910 align:start position:0%
um ask for a bit of personal privilege
here

04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:09:24.530 --> 04:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
um the representatives have clearly put
 
04:09:27.469 --> 04:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of work into their Amendment
 
04:09:30.170 --> 04:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
um it is six pages long and I cannot
 
04:09:32.150 --> 04:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
read it while also attending to your
 
04:09:33.769 --> 04:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
comments I just my brain doesn't work
 
04:09:34.849 --> 04:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
that way
 
04:09:37.150 --> 04:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
um so I would like to beg everyone's
 
04:09:40.189 --> 04:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
Indulgence in giving the committee a few
 
04:09:42.290 --> 04:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
minutes to actually read this so that I
 
04:09:44.510 --> 04:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
can ask intelligent questions I had
 
04:09:46.250 --> 04:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
prepared questions based on the original
 
04:09:48.410 --> 04:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like there are some
 
04:09:50.269 --> 04:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
significant changes and I would rather
 
04:09:52.969 --> 04:09:52.979 align:start position:0%
spend five minutes reading and
 
04:09:54.410 --> 04:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
understanding what's in front of me and
 
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
asking intelligent questions then spend
 
04:09:58.490 --> 04:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
10 minutes asking you questions that you
 
04:10:00.349 --> 04:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
tell me don't thank your representative
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
for bringing this up the chair will
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:21.410 --> 04:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
can we ask for just for a little bit of
 
04:10:23.330 --> 04:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
Silence though because the recess is so
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
that we can have the time to to read
 
04:16:08.290 --> 04:16:08.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:25.030 --> 04:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:28.790 --> 04:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
Representatives you may continue
 
04:16:35.150 --> 04:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:38.030 --> 04:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chair representative Raymond had
 
04:16:40.250 --> 04:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
had was going to ask a question but she
 
04:16:45.290 --> 04:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:48.050 --> 04:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chairman I too have
 
04:16:50.090 --> 04:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
prepared remarks but in view the fact
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
that there are questions on
 
04:16:54.650 --> 04:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
representative greeson's testimony I
 
04:16:56.750 --> 04:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
will wait until the questions have been
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
04:17:06.769 --> 04:17:06.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:17:09.769 --> 04:17:09.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh your test testimony and
 
04:17:13.490 --> 04:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for articulating the amendment
 
04:17:17.330 --> 04:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
um so on line five where it says uh
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
actually starts online for the general
 
04:17:20.630 --> 04:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
court further finds that important
 
04:17:22.670 --> 04:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
information related to minor child shall
 
04:17:26.510 --> 04:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
not be purposely purposefully withheld
 
04:17:28.610 --> 04:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
if inquiring
 
04:17:28.620 --> 04:17:30.889 align:start position:0%
if inquiring
correct

04:17:30.889 --> 04:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:17:34.610 --> 04:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh the this was in in reference to
 
04:17:36.530 --> 04:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
actually in the original version of the
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill the statement actually had to not
 
04:17:42.170 --> 04:17:42.180 align:start position:0%
be withheld either inadvertently or
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
purposefully and so uh we don't want
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
someone accidentally committing a crime
 
04:17:49.550 --> 04:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
we needed to eliminate the inadvertently
 
04:17:51.769 --> 04:17:51.779 align:start position:0%
portion of it and so this is purposely
 
04:17:54.070 --> 04:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
withheld okay
 
04:17:57.229 --> 04:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh and I'll come back to questions I I
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
got a bunch of somebody else

04:18:44.990 --> 04:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
04:18:47.210 --> 04:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
representatives for taking my question
 
04:18:48.410 --> 04:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
um looking through the bill very
 
04:18:48.420 --> 04:18:49.670 align:start position:0%
um looking through the bill very
carefully

04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
04:18:49.680 --> 04:18:50.990 align:start position:0%
carefully
um

04:18:50.990 --> 04:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:54.650 --> 04:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
I I don't see what is in here
 
04:18:56.870 --> 04:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't already exist someplace
 
04:18:59.929 --> 04:18:59.939 align:start position:0%
else as in federal or state statutes
 
04:19:03.410 --> 04:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh directives
 
04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
you know having talked for 40 years I'm
 
04:19:07.610 --> 04:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
looking at each item and I'm saying yeah
 
04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
okay I get it I see it we do it for
 
04:19:13.250 --> 04:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
example opting out of
 
04:19:15.229 --> 04:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
sex education
 
04:19:17.090 --> 04:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
kids can opt out of absolutely
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
everything and anything that a parent
 
04:19:20.689 --> 04:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
says I don't want my kid to participate
 
04:19:23.870 --> 04:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
in so can you just direct me to where in
 
04:19:25.670 --> 04:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is there something different
 
04:19:28.010 --> 04:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
from what I haven't experienced in 40
 
04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
years as a high school teacher
 
04:19:34.910 --> 04:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question the
 
04:19:37.309 --> 04:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
motivation behind
 
04:19:39.110 --> 04:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:19:40.570 --> 04:19:40.580 align:start position:0%
is because
 
04:19:43.250 --> 04:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
despite being in law
 
04:19:45.349 --> 04:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of infringement upon the
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
rights of parents so much so that a
 
04:19:49.729 --> 04:19:49.739 align:start position:0%
judge in Manchester last year said that
 
04:19:51.530 --> 04:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
parents don't have rights
 
04:19:54.769 --> 04:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
and so we want to clarify that indeed
 
04:19:56.929 --> 04:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
they do have rights these are their
 
04:19:59.090 --> 04:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
rights that in fact this isn't even an
 
04:20:01.130 --> 04:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list on this right of those
 
04:20:04.070 --> 04:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
rights however the law can only enforce
 
04:20:06.650 --> 04:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
that which is stated in in this in this
 
04:20:09.229 --> 04:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
if this becomes law you can only enforce
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
what's written in here the language of
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is slightly different from the
 
04:20:16.729 --> 04:20:16.739 align:start position:0%
original version in that the the
 
04:20:19.790 --> 04:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
language outlining all the rights that
 
04:20:22.429 --> 04:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
parents have is actually taken from a
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
technical advisory that was issued last
 
04:20:27.650 --> 04:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
year uh by the Department of Education
 
04:20:28.670 --> 04:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:20:31.550 --> 04:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
Education and so this was this was
 
04:20:35.090 --> 04:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
submitted to remind schools that parents
 
04:20:37.010 --> 04:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
do indeed have rights here's the
 
04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
references to statute we just wanted to
 
04:20:42.349 --> 04:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
codify this in one Clearinghouse this is
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
these are the rights that parents have
 
04:20:46.729 --> 04:20:46.739 align:start position:0%
this is the enforcement mechanism behind
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
those rights if there's no enforcement
 
04:20:50.510 --> 04:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
then there are no rights and there's
 
04:20:52.729 --> 04:20:52.739 align:start position:0%
clearly been some infring and I'm sure
 
04:20:53.929 --> 04:20:53.939 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of people who will
 
04:20:56.269 --> 04:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
testify as to how school and it's just
 
04:20:58.790 --> 04:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
like with right to know we have the 91a
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
laws I sit on the Judiciary Committee
 
04:21:02.150 --> 04:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we have bills that are coming before
 
04:21:04.610 --> 04:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
us because despite having laws on the
 
04:21:06.469 --> 04:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
book referring to ever the citizens
 
04:21:08.090 --> 04:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
right to know what's going on in their
 
04:21:10.610 --> 04:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
government you still get obstruction by
 
04:21:12.110 --> 04:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
the same government officials who refuse
 
04:21:14.269 --> 04:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
to release the information under a right
 
04:21:16.250 --> 04:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
to know request so just because it's
 
04:21:17.330 --> 04:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
written in the law doesn't mean people
 
04:21:21.610 --> 04:21:21.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:24.950 --> 04:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman
 
04:21:26.870 --> 04:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming before us today and
 
04:21:30.229 --> 04:21:30.239 align:start position:0%

um

04:21:31.130 --> 04:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
so as a former as an educator
 
04:21:37.729 --> 04:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
my concern is and as a parent as well so
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
both sides I've got three teenagers
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
and they're in high school and we
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
regularly have meetings at school and I
 
04:21:48.110 --> 04:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
hear the guidance counselor say to my
 
04:21:48.120 --> 04:21:49.610 align:start position:0%
hear the guidance counselor say to my
son

04:21:49.610 --> 04:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
son
 
04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
whatever we talk about We're not gonna
 
04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
like there's a there's a privacy code in
 
04:21:57.830 --> 04:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
those teenage years
 
04:22:00.349 --> 04:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
um of of letting students know that
 
04:22:03.229 --> 04:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
there's a safe place for them at school
 
04:22:07.610 --> 04:22:07.620 align:start position:0%

04:22:09.760 --> 04:22:09.770 align:start position:0%
divulged to their parents
 
04:22:09.770 --> 04:22:10.130 align:start position:0%
divulged to their parents

04:22:10.130 --> 04:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:22:10.140 --> 04:22:11.349 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:22:11.349 --> 04:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:14.269 --> 04:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
my fear My worry is that those
 
04:22:17.090 --> 04:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
relationships will become severed and
 
04:22:19.849 --> 04:22:19.859 align:start position:0%
school will no longer necessarily be a
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
safe place
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
and then on the other side
 
04:22:30.050 --> 04:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:32.570 --> 04:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
um they're pretty important in our
 
04:22:34.309 --> 04:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
community and
 
04:22:37.250 --> 04:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that this would affect
 
04:22:40.370 --> 04:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
folks from going into education and
 
04:22:42.349 --> 04:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
wanting to be in public service of
 
04:22:46.729 --> 04:22:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:49.010 --> 04:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
they would lose control of their
 
04:22:53.570 --> 04:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
classroom to potential parents that
 
04:22:56.510 --> 04:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know you get where I'm going at so
 
04:22:58.490 --> 04:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
do you think that this would have an
 
04:23:00.410 --> 04:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
effect on
 
04:23:05.210 --> 04:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:08.269 --> 04:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know who will and will not get
 
04:23:11.030 --> 04:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
into education but I also to flip that
 
04:23:12.410 --> 04:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
back around
 
04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about the relationship
 
04:23:16.189 --> 04:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
between children and their parents and
 
04:23:18.530 --> 04:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
what might undermine that relationship
 
04:23:21.910 --> 04:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh why would why would teachers
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
intentionally Place themselves between
 
04:23:29.389 --> 04:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
a a parent and their child
 
04:23:32.929 --> 04:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
does that not then make the home a not
 
04:23:35.389 --> 04:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
so safe place
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
you you are you are causing the child to
 
04:23:39.950 --> 04:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
then question
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
whether their parents care for them or
 
04:23:45.410 --> 04:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
love them uh I know that was it it
 
04:23:48.830 --> 04:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
caught me just I was taken aback by by a
 
04:23:51.050 --> 04:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
very disturbing comment that came out
 
04:23:53.990 --> 04:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
some kids will be beaten to death if
 
04:23:55.729 --> 04:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
their parents find out
 
04:23:58.670 --> 04:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
about this this info find this find out
 
04:24:00.710 --> 04:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
this information and that what that does
 
04:24:04.309 --> 04:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
now is paint parents all parents as
 
04:24:06.290 --> 04:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
being child abusers
 
04:24:08.689 --> 04:24:08.699 align:start position:0%
just all you have to do is disagree with
 
04:24:10.429 --> 04:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
the some school policy all you have to
 
04:24:13.250 --> 04:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
do is oppose whatever all you have to do
 
04:24:15.410 --> 04:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
is ask the question hey what's going on
 
04:24:16.969 --> 04:24:16.979 align:start position:0%
with my child at school and now all of a
 
04:24:19.130 --> 04:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
sudden you're being looked at as a child
 
04:24:21.650 --> 04:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
abuser so how does that Foster trust
 
04:24:23.929 --> 04:24:23.939 align:start position:0%
between the parents and the schools how
 
04:24:25.490 --> 04:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
is that fostering a good positive
 
04:24:27.650 --> 04:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
relationship why would parents then want
 
04:24:29.929 --> 04:24:29.939 align:start position:0%
to put their children in schools I'm
 
04:24:31.969 --> 04:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that kids are coming out of
 
04:24:33.889 --> 04:24:33.899 align:start position:0%
the public schools because the parents
 
04:24:35.450 --> 04:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
don't feel that their children are safe
 
04:24:37.250 --> 04:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
in the schools because there's not even
 
04:24:39.650 --> 04:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
a positive relationship between the
 
04:24:41.269 --> 04:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
parents and the schools so that's
 
04:24:43.189 --> 04:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
undermining the whole relationship at
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
home so it's it remember you we got to
 
04:24:48.889 --> 04:24:48.899 align:start position:0%
go back to natural rights
 
04:24:50.870 --> 04:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
the relationship between a parent and
 
04:24:52.910 --> 04:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
the child is a natural right
 
04:24:55.130 --> 04:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
there is no natural right of a student
 
04:24:57.889 --> 04:24:57.899 align:start position:0%
or teacher and a student so I'm not
 
04:24:59.870 --> 04:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
really sure where your concerns are
 
04:25:02.590 --> 04:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
arising from when if you are purposely
 
04:25:04.670 --> 04:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
misinforming parents if you're purposely
 
04:25:06.530 --> 04:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
just lying to parents if you're
 
04:25:08.330 --> 04:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
withholding information that's that
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
parents need to know about their own
 
04:25:10.199 --> 04:25:11.150 align:start position:0%
parents need to know about their own
children

04:25:11.150 --> 04:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
separate it from any kind of abuse abuse
 
04:25:15.950 --> 04:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
is a totally different and and and not a
 
04:25:19.130 --> 04:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
anything that we can uh support or
 
04:25:22.849 --> 04:25:22.859 align:start position:0%
condone in any way separate that
 
04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
from just every other ordinary citizen
 
04:25:27.110 --> 04:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of their political persuasion
 
04:25:29.750 --> 04:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
you've now labeled them as a as a as an
 
04:25:32.689 --> 04:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
abuser in a domestic terrorist
 
04:25:35.170 --> 04:25:35.180 align:start position:0%
representative picking up on that shred
 
04:25:37.729 --> 04:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
when you were describing the assistant
 
04:25:41.149 --> 04:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
principal in Colorado who was told to
 
04:25:44.750 --> 04:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
lie to the parents do you think if that
 
04:25:48.349 --> 04:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
either is and we discovered it or is
 
04:25:51.410 --> 04:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
becoming more common this will
 
04:25:54.830 --> 04:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
accelerate the drive amongst many people
 
04:25:57.530 --> 04:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
for Education accounts and charter
 
04:25:59.809 --> 04:25:59.819 align:start position:0%
schools and religious schools and
 
04:26:02.210 --> 04:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and so on because the
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
distrust has
 
04:26:10.130 --> 04:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
now grown and for palpable reason
 
04:26:13.309 --> 04:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
I absolutely agree that this would only
 
04:26:17.090 --> 04:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
exacerbate the problem of distrust it
 
04:26:19.370 --> 04:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
would so Discord in the community
 
04:26:22.370 --> 04:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
between the the parents and the schools
 
04:26:24.889 --> 04:26:24.899 align:start position:0%
with the teachers children are just
 
04:26:26.510 --> 04:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
they're just not going to know who to
 
04:26:27.950 --> 04:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
trust they won't trust their parents and
 
04:26:29.510 --> 04:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
they won't trust the teachers they're
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
not going to have anyone to turn to
 
04:26:33.889 --> 04:26:33.899 align:start position:0%
because who if if my parents are lying
 
04:26:36.290 --> 04:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
to me or if my teachers are lying to me
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
then who do I turn to why are we having
 
04:26:41.149 --> 04:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
to put the National Suicide Hotline on
 
04:26:42.830 --> 04:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
the back of their ID card I think
 
04:26:44.450 --> 04:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
they're going to get busier if we cannot
 
04:26:48.050 --> 04:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
even form a a a relationship based on
 
04:26:51.590 --> 04:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
trust and so and by the way we know
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
about that uh issue of the school in
 
04:26:56.030 --> 04:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
Colorado because of a right to know
 
04:26:56.040 --> 04:26:56.990 align:start position:0%
Colorado because of a right to know
request

04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%

so much for indulging me and letting me
 
04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
have a chance to read this I really
 
04:27:11.870 --> 04:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
04:27:13.550 --> 04:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
um so I have a couple questions on the
 
04:27:14.510 --> 04:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
amendment and then I have a couple
 
04:27:16.429 --> 04:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
questions that your testimony has been
 
04:27:19.490 --> 04:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
just two questions and we'll give others
 
04:27:21.710 --> 04:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
a chance and we may get back to you so
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
my I will ask first about your testimony
 
04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
um you're citing a case in
 
04:27:30.590 --> 04:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
um Colorado and you cited a judge saying
 
04:27:32.330 --> 04:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
parents don't have rights here in New
 
04:27:34.370 --> 04:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I'm asking you to please
 
04:27:38.269 --> 04:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
send the committee that information so
 
04:27:40.490 --> 04:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
that we can see that news article or
 
04:27:41.870 --> 04:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
write to no request or whatever it is
 
04:27:43.910 --> 04:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
and then any case law regarding office
 
04:27:46.370 --> 04:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
of civil rights complaints that allege
 
04:27:49.010 --> 04:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
that schools are violating parents
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
rights uh in this way
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
um and then on the
 
04:27:56.870 --> 04:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
um Amendment
 
04:27:59.889 --> 04:27:59.899 align:start position:0%
um my question I'll have to boil it down
 
04:28:05.870 --> 04:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:08.570 --> 04:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
um three
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
um if you look down to
 
04:28:12.849 --> 04:28:12.859 align:start position:0%
um lines
 
04:28:16.570 --> 04:28:16.580 align:start position:0%
22 and 26
 
04:28:19.450 --> 04:28:19.460 align:start position:0%
it says on 22
 
04:28:22.370 --> 04:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
the right to review medical records and
 
04:28:23.929 --> 04:28:23.939 align:start position:0%
then there's some exceptions if there's
 
04:28:26.450 --> 04:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
a if there's a criminal component what
 
04:28:31.070 --> 04:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
about dcyf involvement so for example if
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
there is a dcyf case alleging medical
 
04:28:37.969 --> 04:28:37.979 align:start position:0%
neglect or some sort of abuse or any
 
04:28:40.130 --> 04:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
other type of dcyf involvement where
 
04:28:42.769 --> 04:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
dcyf is investigating using medical
 
04:28:47.149 --> 04:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
records would that also be appropriate
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
to have an exception here or are you
 
04:28:51.290 --> 04:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
thinking only if it's a criminal
 
04:28:51.300 --> 04:28:53.630 align:start position:0%
thinking only if it's a criminal
investigation

04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
04:28:57.110 --> 04:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
when dcyf is involved there is a
 
04:28:59.269 --> 04:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest for there to
 
04:29:01.269 --> 04:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
be an action
 
04:29:04.429 --> 04:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully theoretically dcyf does not
 
04:29:07.790 --> 04:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
interject itself into domestic
 
04:29:11.389 --> 04:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
situations uninvitedly or not directed
 
04:29:14.210 --> 04:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
by an authority to no someone makes a
 
04:29:17.450 --> 04:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
report dcif goes out so when the parents
 
04:29:17.460 --> 04:29:18.849 align:start position:0%
report dcif goes out so when the parents
are

04:29:18.849 --> 04:29:18.859 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:29:22.910 --> 04:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
and by nature of an investigation there
 
04:29:22.920 --> 04:29:23.990 align:start position:0%
and by nature of an investigation there
is

04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:29:26.090 --> 04:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
an investigation of a crime committed
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
either neglect or abuse
 
04:29:30.349 --> 04:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
so dcyf being involved is the right to
 
04:29:32.330 --> 04:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
access and review all medical records of
 
04:29:34.490 --> 04:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
his or her minor child unless prohibited
 
04:29:37.130 --> 04:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
by law if the parent has been convicted
 
04:29:38.570 --> 04:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
of any crime against me or if the parent
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
is the subject of an investigation of a
 
04:29:43.130 --> 04:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
crime perhaps neglect or abuse so the
 
04:29:45.710 --> 04:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
investigation may be by dcyf and law
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency has requested of the
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
applicable court that the information
 
04:29:51.170 --> 04:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
not be released and so to be able to
 
04:29:54.349 --> 04:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
investigate is is uh is part of the
 
04:29:56.330 --> 04:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest and is not
 
04:29:58.429 --> 04:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
interfered with they're still able to do
 
04:30:01.969 --> 04:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
that and so that becomes a court
 
04:30:05.929 --> 04:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
directed uh order at that point so dcyf
 
04:30:07.910 --> 04:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
can still investigate and the medical
 
04:30:09.649 --> 04:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
records if the judge determines that
 
04:30:10.849 --> 04:30:10.859 align:start position:0%
they shall not have access to the
 
04:30:12.410 --> 04:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
records then the judge can then issue
 
04:30:14.269 --> 04:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
that the parents cannot have access at
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
that point so it's all within law
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the investigative uh
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
process so it's not a conflict at all
 
04:30:24.830 --> 04:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
other questions from other
 
04:30:28.370 --> 04:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
Representatives representative Petrino
 
04:30:30.110 --> 04:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:30:31.969 --> 04:30:31.979 align:start position:0%
again representatives for taking another
 
04:30:31.979 --> 04:30:34.010 align:start position:0%
again representatives for taking another
question

04:30:34.010 --> 04:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:30:36.710 --> 04:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm a parent I'm a grandparent I was
 
04:30:39.110 --> 04:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
also an educator for 40 years
 
04:30:42.290 --> 04:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
um vast majority of teachers School
 
04:30:44.269 --> 04:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
administrators and so forth are parents
 
04:30:47.630 --> 04:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
themselves why do you think they would
 
04:30:50.689 --> 04:30:50.699 align:start position:0%
put forth policies that would deny them
 
04:30:53.510 --> 04:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
their rights as parents and we're
 
04:30:55.729 --> 04:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
talking teachers and parents vast
 
04:30:58.490 --> 04:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
majority of teachers our parents do you
 
04:31:00.410 --> 04:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
think that they would put forth policies
 
04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
that would deny them their own personal
 
04:31:02.520 --> 04:31:04.309 align:start position:0%
that would deny them their own personal
rights

04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
rights
 
04:31:06.050 --> 04:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
04:31:07.790 --> 04:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know why they would I don't
 
04:31:09.349 --> 04:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't understand that they
 
04:31:09.359 --> 04:31:10.790 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't understand that they
are

04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:31:10.800 --> 04:31:11.469 align:start position:0%
are
um

04:31:11.469 --> 04:31:11.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:14.210 --> 04:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
these are their rights as well as
 
04:31:17.570 --> 04:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
parents if you are an educator and you
 
04:31:19.189 --> 04:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
have a child in a school you are not
 
04:31:21.469 --> 04:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
directly teaching that that child let's
 
04:31:22.849 --> 04:31:22.859 align:start position:0%
say you're a fifth grade teacher and
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
your child is now in 10th Grade you're
 
04:31:27.229 --> 04:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
not directly teaching that child
 
04:31:29.149 --> 04:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
um but let's say something's going on at
 
04:31:31.130 --> 04:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
the school that you disagree with you
 
04:31:32.990 --> 04:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
would be covered by these rights right
 
04:31:34.849 --> 04:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
here to be informed about what's going
 
04:31:36.889 --> 04:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
on it doesn't matter what it is
 
04:31:39.110 --> 04:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
everybody keeps thinking all these worst
 
04:31:40.849 --> 04:31:40.859 align:start position:0%
case scenarios oh my God the sky is
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to fall
 
04:31:44.210 --> 04:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
and it's like just basic you have the
 
04:31:45.290 --> 04:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
right to know what's going on with your
 
04:31:46.610 --> 04:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
kid don't you want the right to know
 
04:31:47.809 --> 04:31:47.819 align:start position:0%
what's going on with your kid at school
 
04:31:51.410 --> 04:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
and so it they don't understand I don't
 
04:31:52.550 --> 04:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
know whether they don't understand they
 
04:31:53.990 --> 04:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't care they don't know I don't know
 
04:31:55.550 --> 04:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
why they would do it I don't think it's
 
04:31:57.170 --> 04:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
a simple answer
 
04:31:57.180 --> 04:31:58.670 align:start position:0%
a simple answer
so

04:31:58.670 --> 04:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:01.070 --> 04:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
understanding that these rights as a
 
04:32:04.250 --> 04:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
parent apply to you regardless of your
 
04:32:04.260 --> 04:32:06.110 align:start position:0%
parent apply to you regardless of your
profession

04:32:06.110 --> 04:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
profession
 
04:32:09.170 --> 04:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
I would just add to that that one of the
 
04:32:11.570 --> 04:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
reasons why this bill has been put forth
 
04:32:14.689 --> 04:32:14.699 align:start position:0%
in this state as well as in other states
 
04:32:17.689 --> 04:32:17.699 align:start position:0%
and now a bill introduced in Congress
 
04:32:19.610 --> 04:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
along the same lines is the bill that
 
04:32:21.769 --> 04:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
we're looking at today is because there
 
04:32:24.110 --> 04:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
have been numerous instances across this
 
04:32:28.189 --> 04:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
country where policies have been put in
 
04:32:31.570 --> 04:32:31.580 align:start position:0%
place or individuals have acted in a way
 
04:32:34.010 --> 04:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
that effectively
 
04:32:34.020 --> 04:32:35.450 align:start position:0%
that effectively
uh

04:32:35.450 --> 04:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:32:37.990 --> 04:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh prohibit
 
04:32:41.450 --> 04:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
by the action of the individual the
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
parent from knowing what is going on
 
04:32:46.429 --> 04:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
with respect to his or her child or
 
04:32:48.530 --> 04:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
children in that school or in that
 
04:32:50.510 --> 04:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
Medical Care Facility this is
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
essentially a right to know Bill and
 
04:32:54.590 --> 04:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
what it does is it brings together all
 
04:32:57.469 --> 04:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
of the rights of parents and and
 
04:32:59.450 --> 04:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
publishes it requires that they be
 
04:33:01.370 --> 04:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
distributed to parents so that parents
 
04:33:03.530 --> 04:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
know what their rights are whether they
 
04:33:06.890 --> 04:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
exercise them or not is a function of
 
04:33:08.689 --> 04:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
their understanding of their parental
 
04:33:10.910 --> 04:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility and how they can how they
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
conduct themselves as parents however to
 
04:33:18.349 --> 04:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
to even begin to think that there are uh
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
that there are things going on that do
 
04:33:24.051 --> 04:33:24.061 align:start position:0%
not need to be addressed in legislation
 
04:33:26.570 --> 04:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
such as this goes against the grain of
 
04:33:31.150 --> 04:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone
 
04:33:35.869 --> 04:33:35.879 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:33:39.769 --> 04:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:42.890 --> 04:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that when you spoke
 
04:33:44.689 --> 04:33:44.699 align:start position:0%
earlier about
 
04:33:47.929 --> 04:33:47.939 align:start position:0%
um the possibility of a parent abusing a
 
04:33:50.090 --> 04:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
child when they become
 
04:33:52.609 --> 04:33:52.619 align:start position:0%
uh knowledgeable of something that
 
04:33:55.369 --> 04:33:55.379 align:start position:0%
happens in school you in this amendment
 
04:33:59.869 --> 04:33:59.879 align:start position:0%
have addressed that on page four uh
 
04:34:03.709 --> 04:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
section three Roman numeral three uh the
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
first uh lowercase
 
04:34:09.250 --> 04:34:09.260 align:start position:0%
parenthetical a
 
04:34:12.170 --> 04:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
uthorizes a parent of a minor child to
 
04:34:15.709 --> 04:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
in this state to engage in contact that
 
04:34:19.131 --> 04:34:19.141 align:start position:0%
is unlawful or to abuse or neglect his
 
04:34:21.769 --> 04:34:21.779 align:start position:0%
or her minor child
 
04:34:24.529 --> 04:34:24.539 align:start position:0%
you have addressed all of that which was
 
04:34:26.631 --> 04:34:26.641 align:start position:0%
something that I asked for last year and
 
04:34:28.369 --> 04:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much for addressing
 
04:34:32.150 --> 04:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
that although the abusive parents
 
04:34:33.769 --> 04:34:33.779 align:start position:0%
are not
 
04:34:36.769 --> 04:34:36.779 align:start position:0%
in numbers that good parents are thank
 
04:34:39.830 --> 04:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
you God this takes care of that is that
 
04:34:39.840 --> 04:34:41.631 align:start position:0%
you God this takes care of that is that
correct

04:34:41.631 --> 04:34:41.641 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:34:44.410 --> 04:34:44.420 align:start position:0%
it it does take care of that actually
 
04:34:48.010 --> 04:34:48.020 align:start position:0%
that Clause was in the bill last year
 
04:34:50.631 --> 04:34:50.641 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it didn't pass last year
 
04:34:52.490 --> 04:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
but but it was actually in there that's
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
a very key component to this we want
 
04:34:56.390 --> 04:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
everyone to understand there's
 
04:34:59.631 --> 04:34:59.641 align:start position:0%
absolutely no
 
04:35:01.970 --> 04:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
can't even begin to Fathom condoning
 
04:35:04.250 --> 04:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
anyone abusing their child
 
04:35:07.490 --> 04:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
and and under under any guys whatsoever
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
and so that is a key component of this
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
law and always had or this bill and
 
04:35:15.170 --> 04:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
always has been you do not have the
 
04:35:16.849 --> 04:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
right this is where natural rights and
 
04:35:18.709 --> 04:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
where government is allowed to infringe
 
04:35:21.709 --> 04:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
because no rights are absolute
 
04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
government has the right or the power
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
excuse me and the authority
 
04:35:28.131 --> 04:35:28.141 align:start position:0%
to then step in and say you do not have
 
04:35:30.609 --> 04:35:30.619 align:start position:0%
the right to abuse your child
 
04:35:32.929 --> 04:35:32.939 align:start position:0%
uncharacteristically for me I will be
 
04:35:35.150 --> 04:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
brief in responding and adding and
 
04:35:38.029 --> 04:35:38.039 align:start position:0%
saying and summing and saying under no
 
04:35:38.039 --> 04:35:39.709 align:start position:0%
saying and summing and saying under no
circumstances

04:35:39.709 --> 04:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
04:35:43.131 --> 04:35:43.141 align:start position:0%
under no circumstances is child abuse
 
04:35:46.250 --> 04:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
ever condoned under the law there's no
 
04:35:49.730 --> 04:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
exemption this bill does not provide any
 
04:35:52.189 --> 04:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
exemption whatsoever for holding
 
04:35:55.250 --> 04:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
accountable any parent who on the basis
 
04:35:59.150 --> 04:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
of information allegedly received from a
 
04:36:02.990 --> 04:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
school official or employee or a medical
 
04:36:05.390 --> 04:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
practitioner then has the right to do
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
something that otherwise under law that
 
04:36:12.429 --> 04:36:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
I have a question here is it true to say
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
that this bill across the board
 
04:36:23.650 --> 04:36:23.660 align:start position:0%
is dealing with outliers that is to say
 
04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
abusive parents
 
04:36:28.789 --> 04:36:28.799 align:start position:0%
bad acting teachers we're not talking
 
04:36:31.551 --> 04:36:31.561 align:start position:0%
about all the parents we're not talking
 
04:36:34.250 --> 04:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
about all or probably even many of the
 
04:36:37.131 --> 04:36:37.141 align:start position:0%
teachers are we not talking about those
 
04:36:39.529 --> 04:36:39.539 align:start position:0%
exception cases
 
04:36:42.830 --> 04:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
on across the Spectrum yes and in
 
04:36:45.470 --> 04:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
addition what we have is a phenomenon
 
04:36:47.570 --> 04:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
that is occurring that has emerged in
 
04:36:48.830 --> 04:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
the culture
 
04:36:51.949 --> 04:36:51.959 align:start position:0%
such that there are parties who believe
 
04:36:54.529 --> 04:36:54.539 align:start position:0%
that they have a superior we believe
 
04:36:56.330 --> 04:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
that they have they believe they have a
 
04:36:59.390 --> 04:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
superior right to be able to educate
 
04:37:03.289 --> 04:37:03.299 align:start position:0%
children in a way that is contrary to
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
the way that children have been educated
 
04:37:08.769 --> 04:37:08.779 align:start position:0%
in the past and in in and contravenes
 
04:37:11.150 --> 04:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
the authority and otherwise the
 
04:37:13.429 --> 04:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
authority of the parent the primary
 
04:37:13.439 --> 04:37:14.810 align:start position:0%
authority of the parent the primary
relationship

04:37:14.810 --> 04:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
04:37:17.090 --> 04:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
this is a cultural phenomenon that is
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
growing and is re one of the reasons why
 
04:37:23.150 --> 04:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
we are seeing the the veritable plethora
 
04:37:26.090 --> 04:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
of cases that are going to court and the
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
bills that are being introduced in state
 
04:37:29.810 --> 04:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
legislatures and now in the Congress of
 
04:37:32.090 --> 04:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
the United States we have a problem yes
 
04:37:34.551 --> 04:37:34.561 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Perez
 
04:37:36.109 --> 04:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
um can you give me some examples of what
 
04:37:40.730 --> 04:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
is happening in the school that they
 
04:37:43.609 --> 04:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
that you feel didn't need this to be
 
04:37:45.890 --> 04:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
this bill to be introduced and can you
 
04:37:48.410 --> 04:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
give me an example what stays are you
 
04:37:49.910 --> 04:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
talking about that these issues been
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
happening because when I take when I
 
04:37:54.529 --> 04:37:54.539 align:start position:0%
make another decision I'm listen to
 
04:37:56.269 --> 04:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
every single testimony with all my
 
04:37:56.279 --> 04:37:57.230 align:start position:0%
every single testimony with all my
respect

04:37:57.230 --> 04:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
respect
 
04:37:59.150 --> 04:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
but when you told me that it's happening
 
04:38:01.490 --> 04:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
another state when you told me that that
 
04:38:03.170 --> 04:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
parents have an issue when you told me
 
04:38:04.670 --> 04:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
all this
 
04:38:06.289 --> 04:38:06.299 align:start position:0%
I hear you
 
04:38:08.810 --> 04:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
but I just don't just go with what
 
04:38:10.609 --> 04:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
you're saying I would love to have an
 
04:38:13.551 --> 04:38:13.561 align:start position:0%
examples I would love to have exactly
 
04:38:16.131 --> 04:38:16.141 align:start position:0%
information in front of my my face that
 
04:38:19.189 --> 04:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
I can make the right decision but I just
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
by going by other states and other parts
 
04:38:23.689 --> 04:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
of the country it doesn't mean anything
 
04:38:25.789 --> 04:38:25.799 align:start position:0%
to me I would love to see clear
 
04:38:28.070 --> 04:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
information exactly what is happening
 
04:38:30.650 --> 04:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
what is happening and you know I I would
 
04:38:33.709 --> 04:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
love to see that and and and to be
 
04:38:36.590 --> 04:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
honest I want to know what exactly is
 
04:38:39.230 --> 04:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
being introduced to the students that
 
04:38:42.051 --> 04:38:42.061 align:start position:0%
you feel like uh never been introduced
 
04:38:44.090 --> 04:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
before and is hurting the student is
 
04:38:45.949 --> 04:38:45.959 align:start position:0%
always making the parents uncomfortable
 
04:38:47.390 --> 04:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
the parents don't know what is happening
 
04:38:49.250 --> 04:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
in the school system I would love to see
 
04:38:49.260 --> 04:38:50.390 align:start position:0%
in the school system I would love to see
that

04:38:50.390 --> 04:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:38:52.670 --> 04:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
that way when I make the decision can
 
04:38:54.890 --> 04:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
can I have that information can can you
 
04:38:56.631 --> 04:38:56.641 align:start position:0%
provide me that information that's my
 
04:38:56.641 --> 04:38:57.650 align:start position:0%
provide me that information that's my
question

04:38:57.650 --> 04:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:38:59.631 --> 04:38:59.641 align:start position:0%
how many examples would you like
 
04:39:01.970 --> 04:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
and many as you can I would love to see
 
04:39:05.150 --> 04:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
because more information more data
 
04:39:07.490 --> 04:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's better for me to to you know to
 
04:39:10.970 --> 04:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:12.410 --> 04:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
I would agree
 
04:39:12.420 --> 04:39:14.090 align:start position:0%
I would agree
um

04:39:14.090 --> 04:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:18.289 --> 04:39:18.299 align:start position:0%
for um for wanting to to look at real
 
04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
life examples
 
04:39:23.029 --> 04:39:23.039 align:start position:0%
um and and for your candor in indicating
 
04:39:25.429 --> 04:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
that you're not aware of of many of any
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
of these situations uh we would be we'd
 
04:39:31.029 --> 04:39:31.039 align:start position:0%
be happy to be and pleased to be able to
 
04:39:33.529 --> 04:39:33.539 align:start position:0%
sit down with you and provide you with
 
04:39:36.949 --> 04:39:36.959 align:start position:0%
that information we will do so
 
04:39:40.130 --> 04:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman
 
04:39:43.368 --> 04:39:43.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:39:46.190 --> 04:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
I ever one of my biggest concerns is for
 
04:39:49.490 --> 04:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
our trans and lgbtq youth
 
04:39:49.500 --> 04:39:50.570 align:start position:0%
our trans and lgbtq youth
um

04:39:50.570 --> 04:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:52.670 --> 04:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
and that in many situations it is life
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
and death in terms of
 
04:39:59.208 --> 04:39:59.218 align:start position:0%
um mental health and care for them
 
04:40:02.930 --> 04:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
to be living in the light so if a
 
04:40:02.940 --> 04:40:05.170 align:start position:0%
to be living in the light so if a
student

04:40:05.170 --> 04:40:05.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:08.570 --> 04:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
requests that their pronouns be changed
 
04:40:12.530 --> 04:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
and the teacher then goes to the parents
 
04:40:14.930 --> 04:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
then the parents have requested to know
 
04:40:17.090 --> 04:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
the school lets the parents know that
 
04:40:21.530 --> 04:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
their child is now requested different
 
04:40:21.540 --> 04:40:23.330 align:start position:0%
their child is now requested different
pronouns

04:40:23.330 --> 04:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
pronouns
 
04:40:26.150 --> 04:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
that child goes home
 
04:40:30.350 --> 04:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
is abused because even if it's in law
 
04:40:33.170 --> 04:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
we know that abuse happens and it
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
happens in Dark Places it's not in the
 
04:40:36.480 --> 04:40:37.910 align:start position:0%
happens in Dark Places it's not in the
light

04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
light
 
04:40:37.920 --> 04:40:38.930 align:start position:0%
light
um

04:40:38.930 --> 04:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:42.590 --> 04:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
what is that child student teenager do
 
04:40:44.990 --> 04:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
after they've been abused by their
 
04:40:45.000 --> 04:40:46.250 align:start position:0%
after they've been abused by their
parents

04:40:46.250 --> 04:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
parents
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
because their teacher
 
04:40:51.708 --> 04:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
told them that they refer to different
 
04:40:55.010 --> 04:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
pronouns so what's the recourse for that
 
04:40:55.020 --> 04:40:56.570 align:start position:0%
pronouns so what's the recourse for that
child

04:40:56.570 --> 04:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:40:56.580 --> 04:40:58.310 align:start position:0%
child
student

04:40:58.310 --> 04:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:40:58.320 --> 04:41:00.368 align:start position:0%
student
again

04:41:00.368 --> 04:41:00.378 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:41:03.010 --> 04:41:03.020 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely
 
04:41:06.770 --> 04:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
no provision that would allow for a
 
04:41:09.350 --> 04:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
parent to abuse their child regardless
 
04:41:11.930 --> 04:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
of the circumstances so what does the
 
04:41:14.690 --> 04:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
child do you can call the police you
 
04:41:17.810 --> 04:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
could tell your the we asked about what
 
04:41:20.810 --> 04:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
about dcyf there's I'm being abused at
 
04:41:23.930 --> 04:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
home you there's mandatory reporting so
 
04:41:26.330 --> 04:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
there is recourse for the child how
 
04:41:28.430 --> 04:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
would they do it now if a child is being
 
04:41:30.830 --> 04:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
abused for any reason six-year-old child
 
04:41:32.810 --> 04:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
wets the bed gets abused by the parent
 
04:41:34.670 --> 04:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
they go to school and the child or the
 
04:41:37.128 --> 04:41:37.138 align:start position:0%
teacher sees bruises on the child
 
04:41:39.590 --> 04:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
are you know is is is Mommy hitting you
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
in the morning what why is Mommy
 
04:41:43.550 --> 04:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
whatever that gets a reported there are
 
04:41:43.560 --> 04:41:44.890 align:start position:0%
whatever that gets a reported there are
already

04:41:44.890 --> 04:41:44.900 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:41:47.570 --> 04:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
the means for the saying you're singling
 
04:41:50.930 --> 04:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
at lgbtq kids it's all kids any child
 
04:41:52.970 --> 04:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
that would be abused for whatever reason
 
04:41:55.730 --> 04:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
though and the re and the recourse is
 
04:41:58.190 --> 04:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
the same there is absolutely no excuse
 
04:42:01.310 --> 04:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
whatsoever for abuse and this law would
 
04:42:04.128 --> 04:42:04.138 align:start position:0%
say you can't abuse your kids and if you
 
04:42:06.110 --> 04:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
do abuse your kids we have the law that
 
04:42:08.270 --> 04:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
says how you can be punished and that
 
04:42:10.010 --> 04:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
there is no cover for the for the parent
 
04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
that would abuse the child none
 
04:42:13.850 --> 04:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so I'm not I'm not really
 
04:42:15.530 --> 04:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
sure what you're what you're trying to
 
04:42:18.230 --> 04:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
get at as far as what if this lgbtq
 
04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
child gets abused by their parents what
 
04:42:22.250 --> 04:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
if any child gets abused by their
 
04:42:24.190 --> 04:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
parents for any reason
 
04:42:25.970 --> 04:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
would you like a follow-up
 
04:42:27.890 --> 04:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative just
 
04:42:30.470 --> 04:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
worried about protecting children and
 
04:42:34.128 --> 04:42:34.138 align:start position:0%
their rights representative Perez
 
04:42:37.250 --> 04:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:41.868 --> 04:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
this is hard for me to ask this question
 
04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
but I'm gonna ask it
 
04:42:48.948 --> 04:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
why do you tell a child like myself okay
 
04:42:51.650 --> 04:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
I grew up in a family when I where I
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
went to a Catholic School
 
04:42:56.750 --> 04:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
my dad
 
04:42:59.448 --> 04:42:59.458 align:start position:0%
it was the one who was sexually abusing
 
04:43:00.770 --> 04:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
me okay
 
04:43:03.410 --> 04:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
but my dad was
 
04:43:06.410 --> 04:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
very well-known person and he was given
 
04:43:08.330 --> 04:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
donations to the school a Catholic
 
04:43:08.340 --> 04:43:09.170 align:start position:0%
donations to the school a Catholic
School

04:43:09.170 --> 04:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
School
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
so when my dad was pulling me from the
 
04:43:15.470 --> 04:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
school to abuse me sexual assault me
 
04:43:17.448 --> 04:43:17.458 align:start position:0%
and bring me about this bring me back to
 
04:43:17.458 --> 04:43:18.530 align:start position:0%
and bring me about this bring me back to
school

04:43:18.530 --> 04:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:43:21.650 --> 04:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
after he abused me
 
04:43:24.288 --> 04:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
and the school stayed quiet
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
why do you tell a child like myself
 
04:43:29.390 --> 04:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
when you told me that we are protected
 
04:43:31.670 --> 04:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
or the kids are protected I wasn't
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
protected and that scar is on me for the
 
04:43:37.610 --> 04:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
rest of my life can you tell me why can
 
04:43:40.850 --> 04:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
I tell a child like my like myself when
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
you told me that the kids are protected
 
04:43:45.770 --> 04:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
representative I I'm sorry for for the
 
04:43:47.570 --> 04:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
abuse that you experienced but you were
 
04:43:49.128 --> 04:43:49.138 align:start position:0%
also talking about a very extraordinary
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
case where you were abused by your
 
04:43:54.110 --> 04:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
parent and then protected at the school
 
04:43:56.810 --> 04:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
from that abuse that is a an
 
04:43:59.570 --> 04:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
extraordinary case uh you said that your
 
04:44:03.050 --> 04:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
dad gave money to the school and you
 
04:44:04.610 --> 04:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
that they
 
04:44:06.470 --> 04:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
whatever the collusion was between the
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
school and your dad that would allow
 
04:44:10.070 --> 04:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
that to be covered up there are
 
04:44:12.890 --> 04:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
cover-ups of sexual abuse in all kinds
 
04:44:16.128 --> 04:44:16.138 align:start position:0%
of of organizations not just schools
 
04:44:18.830 --> 04:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's not just parents there's you name
 
04:44:21.368 --> 04:44:21.378 align:start position:0%
the organization Boy Scouts Girl Scouts
 
04:44:24.590 --> 04:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
Public Schools private schools it you
 
04:44:26.090 --> 04:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
you pick the organization and you could
 
04:44:27.650 --> 04:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
find Creeps in every single one of them
 
04:44:30.350 --> 04:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
you can find bad parents if you want to
 
04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
focus on just the bad parents we could
 
04:44:33.708 --> 04:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
do that but I don't think we're going to
 
04:44:35.690 --> 04:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
get anywhere by just trying to what
 
04:44:37.970 --> 04:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
about all these different bad parents
 
04:44:42.770 --> 04:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:49.368 --> 04:44:49.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:55.128 --> 04:44:55.138 align:start position:0%
again you know my question is we we here
 
04:44:57.350 --> 04:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
to protect the children if you taken
 
04:44:57.360 --> 04:44:58.310 align:start position:0%
to protect the children if you taken
away

04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
away
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
that protection by taking away that
 
04:45:04.670 --> 04:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
child to be able to go back to that that
 
04:45:07.368 --> 04:45:07.378 align:start position:0%
teacher and explain to that teacher
 
04:45:09.650 --> 04:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
what happened because when that child
 
04:45:12.708 --> 04:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
went home it got beat up it got beat up
 
04:45:14.150 --> 04:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
really hard
 
04:45:19.368 --> 04:45:19.378 align:start position:0%
and that kid is so so scared to speak up
 
04:45:21.470 --> 04:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
because they have black and blue bruises
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
that has to hide
 
04:45:26.208 --> 04:45:26.218 align:start position:0%
how can that child and we're not talking
 
04:45:27.708 --> 04:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
about parents here only but we're
 
04:45:30.288 --> 04:45:30.298 align:start position:0%
talking about teachers but we're taking
 
04:45:32.930 --> 04:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
but can you explain to me how we're not
 
04:45:34.070 --> 04:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
going to take the ability of the
 
04:45:36.530 --> 04:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
teachers when we're gonna like tell the
 
04:45:38.628 --> 04:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
teacher they can get in trouble if they
 
04:45:40.610 --> 04:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
you know if they they hide some things
 
04:45:42.890 --> 04:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
from the parents our teachers mandatory
 
04:45:42.900 --> 04:45:45.110 align:start position:0%
from the parents our teachers mandatory
yes

04:45:45.110 --> 04:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:45:48.288 --> 04:45:48.298 align:start position:0%
teachers are required by law to report
 
04:45:50.270 --> 04:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
abuse if they are not doing that then
 
04:45:51.770 --> 04:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
they are in violation of the law so
 
04:45:53.570 --> 04:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
who's protecting the children from the
 
04:45:55.490 --> 04:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
negligent teachers
 
04:45:57.050 --> 04:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
and who's protecting the children from
 
04:45:58.610 --> 04:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
the from the teachers who are providing
 
04:46:01.368 --> 04:46:01.378 align:start position:0%
pornography to them where where are they
 
04:46:02.628 --> 04:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
where are the who's protecting the
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
children we're talking about protecting
 
04:46:05.390 --> 04:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
the children but who are we protecting
 
04:46:07.670 --> 04:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
the children from
 
04:46:11.090 --> 04:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
who are we protecting the children from
 
04:46:13.368 --> 04:46:13.378 align:start position:0%
and it's always this example of all
 
04:46:15.530 --> 04:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
these bad parents out there when
 
04:46:17.750 --> 04:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
most parents aren't bad parents so why
 
04:46:19.368 --> 04:46:19.378 align:start position:0%
are why are we hiding things from
 
04:46:22.128 --> 04:46:22.138 align:start position:0%
parents why are we undermining the
 
04:46:23.810 --> 04:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
relationship between the child and the
 
04:46:23.820 --> 04:46:26.868 align:start position:0%
relationship between the child and the
parent

04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:29.330 --> 04:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
representative Petrino
 
04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you again
 
04:46:33.948 --> 04:46:33.958 align:start position:0%
for taking uh one of my questions
 
04:46:36.350 --> 04:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
um my observation is that uh
 
04:46:38.570 --> 04:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
this matter was never an issue in the
 
04:46:40.010 --> 04:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
past it seems to be something that's
 
04:46:42.470 --> 04:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
relatively recent and I'm trying to
 
04:46:44.890 --> 04:46:44.900 align:start position:0%
think of the motivation behind it
 
04:46:47.570 --> 04:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking and correct me if I'm wrong
 
04:46:50.090 --> 04:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
that this really comes down to uh
 
04:46:53.330 --> 04:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
matters regarding the lgbtq community if
 
04:46:56.448 --> 04:46:56.458 align:start position:0%
Johnny gives Billy a Valentine's in
 
04:46:59.990 --> 04:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
School Mom wants to know is this the
 
04:47:01.730 --> 04:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
impetus I really want to get to the
 
04:47:03.770 --> 04:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
heart of the matter uh no there is not
 
04:47:05.090 --> 04:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
I'll just go ahead and I'll just go and
 
04:47:06.890 --> 04:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
answer it no it is not what then would
 
04:47:09.530 --> 04:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
be the assessment
 
04:47:10.910 --> 04:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:47:13.310 --> 04:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
it is the things that are happening in
 
04:47:16.310 --> 04:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
school regardless of the nature of what
 
04:47:17.330 --> 04:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:47:19.970 --> 04:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
the parent has the right to know this
 
04:47:23.868 --> 04:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
law would not prevent kids from Little
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
Johnny giving Tommy a valentine
 
04:47:30.110 --> 04:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
it does not prevent Tommy from wearing a
 
04:47:32.030 --> 04:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
dress and being called Sally
 
04:47:35.628 --> 04:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
it does not stop anything whatsoever it
 
04:47:37.310 --> 04:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
just says that parents have the right to
 
04:47:39.170 --> 04:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
know what's going on in the life of
 
04:47:42.110 --> 04:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
their child that's it no it is not
 
04:47:44.448 --> 04:47:44.458 align:start position:0%
motivated by the lgbtq community that is
 
04:47:46.610 --> 04:47:46.620 align:start position:0%
one aspect of it it's one thing that's
 
04:47:48.530 --> 04:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
happening in the schools you've got the
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
closets where you can go in and and
 
04:47:53.208 --> 04:47:53.218 align:start position:0%
change clothes and it doesn't even stop
 
04:47:55.070 --> 04:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
that from happening
 
04:47:57.410 --> 04:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
it just says the parents have the right
 
04:48:01.128 --> 04:48:01.138 align:start position:0%
to know what's going on and and guide
 
04:48:04.430 --> 04:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
the upbringing of their own children the
 
04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
parents have the right to make those
 
04:48:07.670 --> 04:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
education decisions if they decide that
 
04:48:09.530 --> 04:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
that's not where I want my child I want
 
04:48:11.448 --> 04:48:11.458 align:start position:0%
to do something else they would have the
 
04:48:13.550 --> 04:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
right to then do that as well it has
 
04:48:15.410 --> 04:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with what they can and
 
04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
cannot do as far as the activities go
 
04:48:20.810 --> 04:48:20.820 align:start position:0%
it's anything and everything the parents
 
04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:26.510 --> 04:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
04:48:28.190 --> 04:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:48:29.810 --> 04:48:29.820 align:start position:0%
taking my question I appreciate you
 
04:48:32.690 --> 04:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
being here to support your bill as
 
04:48:34.910 --> 04:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
someone who has great insight into what
 
04:48:37.850 --> 04:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
happens in abusive situations and this
 
04:48:39.530 --> 04:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
is kind of a two-part question is that
 
04:48:39.540 --> 04:48:40.368 align:start position:0%
is kind of a two-part question is that
okay

04:48:40.368 --> 04:48:40.378 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:48:40.378 --> 04:48:41.750 align:start position:0%
okay
so

04:48:41.750 --> 04:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:44.990 --> 04:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
um would it would it surprise you to
 
04:48:47.390 --> 04:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
know that some kids who are in abusive
 
04:48:50.810 --> 04:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
situations actually don't know its abuse
 
04:48:53.750 --> 04:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
because it's the only reality they know
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
that doesn't surprise me at all
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:01.910 --> 04:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
because it's so hard to word and just
 
04:49:04.670 --> 04:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
keep it down to one question I apologize
 
04:49:07.310 --> 04:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
parents who have we're taught you want
 
04:49:08.570 --> 04:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
to talk about the good parents right
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
because obviously there's a lot of talk
 
04:49:13.030 --> 04:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
about abusive parents
 
04:49:17.270 --> 04:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
why is it that a good parent doesn't
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
already have communication with their
 
04:49:21.948 --> 04:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
child open communication where the child
 
04:49:24.650 --> 04:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
is talking to them about all of these
 
04:49:26.690 --> 04:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
things if we're talking about good
 
04:49:28.550 --> 04:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
parents being able to parent
 
04:49:30.650 --> 04:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
I had a wonderful relationship with my
 
04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
parents and I didn't tell them much of
 
04:49:34.448 --> 04:49:34.458 align:start position:0%
anything that was going on in my life
 
04:49:37.070 --> 04:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
adolescence is a very weird experience
 
04:49:38.930 --> 04:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
girls are different than boys I'm pretty
 
04:49:42.470 --> 04:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
sure anyway uh we all experience
 
04:49:44.330 --> 04:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
different things in our lives but I can
 
04:49:45.350 --> 04:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
promise you this there are things that
 
04:49:48.850 --> 04:49:48.860 align:start position:0%
my parents still don't know to this day
 
04:49:50.930 --> 04:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
having a good relationship with your
 
04:49:52.850 --> 04:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
parent and telling them everything is
 
04:49:56.628 --> 04:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
two completely different things
 
04:49:58.490 --> 04:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
yeah once again there's there's
 
04:50:01.190 --> 04:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely no protection whatsoever for
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
abuse by anybody
 
04:50:06.230 --> 04:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
in any and on in any venue under any
 
04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
circumstance and when someone becomes
 
04:50:11.690 --> 04:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
aware of abuse just like if you go to
 
04:50:14.448 --> 04:50:14.458 align:start position:0%
the hospital and um I had a situation a
 
04:50:16.788 --> 04:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
number of years ago where my son had a
 
04:50:19.788 --> 04:50:19.798 align:start position:0%
very adverse reaction to poison ivy well
 
04:50:22.190 --> 04:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
immediately uh the the medical personnel
 
04:50:24.770 --> 04:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
were questioning uh my wife and me as to
 
04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
whether we uh beat him uh with a rod on
 
04:50:29.868 --> 04:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
his heels because they had to do their
 
04:50:31.490 --> 04:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
due diligence
 
04:50:33.890 --> 04:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
by the way let me assure all of you that
 
04:50:36.350 --> 04:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
we were cleared rather quickly and we
 
04:50:39.050 --> 04:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
were not charged with abusing our son
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
because he caught poison ivy on his on
 
04:50:44.570 --> 04:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
his heels but these are real life
 
04:50:47.030 --> 04:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
examples here and real people who when
 
04:50:49.788 --> 04:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
they become aware of abuse they are
 
04:50:49.798 --> 04:50:51.288 align:start position:0%
they become aware of abuse they are
required

04:50:51.288 --> 04:50:51.298 align:start position:0%
required
 
04:50:54.410 --> 04:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
um a clergy are required lawyers are
 
04:50:57.050 --> 04:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
required teachers are required everybody
 
04:50:59.510 --> 04:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
is required if they see something they
 
04:51:01.550 --> 04:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
have to say something and there are
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
child protective services in all of our
 
04:51:06.650 --> 04:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
states and all students have access to
 
04:51:08.448 --> 04:51:08.458 align:start position:0%
that you know you can lead a horse to
 
04:51:10.550 --> 04:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
water but you can't make him drink but
 
04:51:13.368 --> 04:51:13.378 align:start position:0%
you can encourage a child if a child and
 
04:51:14.750 --> 04:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
and part of the educational experience
 
04:51:17.390 --> 04:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
for children can be if something if
 
04:51:19.788 --> 04:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
something is happening in your home that
 
04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
is not good that doesn't make you feel
 
04:51:24.470 --> 04:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
good then then tell me about it and if
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
told about it then the teacher has a
 
04:51:30.350 --> 04:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility to act upon that now
 
04:51:32.628 --> 04:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
where the the but the main main focus of
 
04:51:35.208 --> 04:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
this bill is a parent's right to know
 
04:51:38.570 --> 04:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
what is going on in a classroom or with
 
04:51:41.930 --> 04:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
a health care practitioner we we that
 
04:51:44.330 --> 04:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
right is a natural fundamental primary
 
04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
right that has been established in in in
 
04:51:50.868 --> 04:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
in natural law and also in judicial law
 
04:51:53.570 --> 04:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has ruled on many
 
04:51:55.610 --> 04:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
occasions and in circuit courts of
 
04:51:58.990 --> 04:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
appeal that the parents or the primary
 
04:52:01.190 --> 04:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
caretakers of their children and will
 
04:52:03.230 --> 04:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
direct their upbringing and they cannot
 
04:52:06.110 --> 04:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
be impeded in in that upbringing unless
 
04:52:08.090 --> 04:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
there is something nefarious that's
 
04:52:09.708 --> 04:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
going on in which case there are
 
04:52:12.708 --> 04:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
remedies that are prescribed in law
 
04:52:14.570 --> 04:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
do you wish to follow up representative
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
I do please thank you so what is to you
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
said something about the child being
 
04:52:22.128 --> 04:52:22.138 align:start position:0%
able to tell the teacher if something's
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
happening or whatever what's to make
 
04:52:26.448 --> 04:52:26.458 align:start position:0%
them feel confident that that's going to
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
be secret if they know that anything
 
04:52:31.010 --> 04:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
else that they tell their parents or
 
04:52:33.530 --> 04:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
tell is going to go directly back to the
 
04:52:35.868 --> 04:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
parents how does that keep kids safe and
 
04:52:37.310 --> 04:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
feeling confident in talking to the
 
04:52:39.708 --> 04:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
teacher well I think the question that I
 
04:52:42.110 --> 04:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
hear you asking is what makes a child
 
04:52:44.570 --> 04:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
feel would make a child feel safe and
 
04:52:47.150 --> 04:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
confident to be able to confide in abuse
 
04:52:49.070 --> 04:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
that is taking place in the home to
 
04:52:50.628 --> 04:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
confide in the teacher that abuse is
 
04:52:52.430 --> 04:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
taking place in the home and that
 
04:52:54.530 --> 04:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
nothing will be done about it
 
04:52:57.170 --> 04:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
the the the the point here is that
 
04:52:59.750 --> 04:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
something must be done about it and will
 
04:53:01.670 --> 04:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
be done about it if the teacher doesn't
 
04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:09.230 --> 04:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
I want to rephrase it yes so if if we
 
04:53:12.288 --> 04:53:12.298 align:start position:0%
pass say we pass this bill and it's you
 
04:53:14.270 --> 04:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
know the say the kid has something weird
 
04:53:16.190 --> 04:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
happen where they want to change their
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
middle name to shark and maybe they're
 
04:53:20.750 --> 04:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
being abused at home so maybe it's like
 
04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
their dad's you know name that they
 
04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to identify with anymore so
 
04:53:26.570 --> 04:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
they tell the teacher that but
 
04:53:29.150 --> 04:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
the parent says did my kiddo change
 
04:53:32.628 --> 04:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
their middle name and he says yes well
 
04:53:35.390 --> 04:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
then they get in trouble at home what
 
04:53:37.250 --> 04:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
confidence does that child have that
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
they can say hey you know what my
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
teacher just my my dad beat me when I
 
04:53:44.810 --> 04:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
got home because I didn't because I
 
04:53:46.490 --> 04:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
changed my name what confidence do they
 
04:53:49.190 --> 04:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
have to be able to go find safety at
 
04:53:50.810 --> 04:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
school because a lot of homes are not
 
04:53:54.410 --> 04:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:56.868 --> 04:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
at that point okay first of all the the
 
04:54:00.288 --> 04:54:00.298 align:start position:0%
teacher does not know that the child is
 
04:54:02.628 --> 04:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
going to get beat right the time the
 
04:54:05.470 --> 04:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
child May suspect that he will get beat
 
04:54:08.270 --> 04:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
the child is told this the student the
 
04:54:10.430 --> 04:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
the teacher I want to change my middle
 
04:54:10.440 --> 04:54:12.470 align:start position:0%
the teacher I want to change my middle
name

04:54:12.470 --> 04:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
name
 
04:54:15.708 --> 04:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason but the you know the
 
04:54:19.070 --> 04:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
the the child has not yet told the
 
04:54:19.080 --> 04:54:20.270 align:start position:0%
the the child has not yet told the
teacher

04:54:20.270 --> 04:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
04:54:24.830 --> 04:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:27.170 --> 04:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
you are asking about what to do after
 
04:54:29.990 --> 04:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:32.330 --> 04:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
If the child wants to be called by some
 
04:54:34.910 --> 04:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:37.610 --> 04:54:37.620 align:start position:0%
if the parent asks the teacher would be
 
04:54:39.708 --> 04:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
obligated to tell the parent not lie to
 
04:54:42.590 --> 04:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
the parent the problem is is If the
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
child is then beaten by the parents and
 
04:54:45.890 --> 04:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
the child says
 
04:54:48.050 --> 04:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
I would just got beaten because I I
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
change now the teacher has to act why
 
04:54:53.570 --> 04:54:53.580 align:start position:0%
would the T why would the the student
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
now trust the teacher
 
04:54:59.390 --> 04:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
because the teacher then acted on their
 
04:55:01.250 --> 04:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility the teacher's not going
 
04:55:03.230 --> 04:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
to know
 
04:55:05.170 --> 04:55:05.180 align:start position:0%
what's going to make the child feel safe
 
04:55:08.448 --> 04:55:08.458 align:start position:0%
they told the teacher that I got I got
 
04:55:10.190 --> 04:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
beaten by my dad because I changed my
 
04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
name now the teacher acts in accordance
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
with the law as the teacher is supposed
 
04:55:16.550 --> 04:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
to act now the T this the the child
 
04:55:18.470 --> 04:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
trusts the teacher because the teacher
 
04:55:21.948 --> 04:55:21.958 align:start position:0%
has now protected them from the abuse
 
04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
you that that's that's the proper
 
04:55:24.000 --> 04:55:25.250 align:start position:0%
you that that's that's the proper
response

04:55:25.250 --> 04:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
response
 
04:55:27.770 --> 04:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
but otherwise T child wants to change
 
04:55:30.050 --> 04:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
their name to something else
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
parent asks is my child going by some
 
04:55:33.590 --> 04:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
other name
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
the teacher says yes
 
04:55:38.690 --> 04:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
that's it representative my follow-up
 
04:55:41.530 --> 04:55:41.540 align:start position:0%
question to this very specific question
 
04:55:44.868 --> 04:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
is over the 50 years I've done a fair
 
04:55:47.330 --> 04:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
bit of counseling I've discovered the
 
04:55:49.550 --> 04:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
danger in families of too many secrets
 
04:55:52.610 --> 04:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
and I have seen so many families where
 
04:55:54.350 --> 04:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
the parents did not learn it from the
 
04:55:54.360 --> 04:55:55.610 align:start position:0%
the parents did not learn it from the
child

04:55:55.610 --> 04:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
the parents learned it from a neighbor
 
04:56:01.788 --> 04:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
whose child told the neighbor whose
 
04:56:04.310 --> 04:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
neighbor told the parents and the anger
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
in the family was not so much the action
 
04:56:08.810 --> 04:56:08.820 align:start position:0%
but the duplicity
 
04:56:11.150 --> 04:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
the skulking about the secrecies and so
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
on and I knew growing up that if I did
 
04:56:15.288 --> 04:56:15.298 align:start position:0%
something downtown it didn't have to be
 
04:56:18.110 --> 04:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
my teacher it was a generic teacher in
 
04:56:20.570 --> 04:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
that City I my parents would know before
 
04:56:24.948 --> 04:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
I get home and that kinda you know this
 
04:56:27.250 --> 04:56:27.260 align:start position:0%
is not in any way
 
04:56:30.770 --> 04:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
making light of the all too real
 
04:56:33.350 --> 04:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
situations where there are abusive
 
04:56:35.510 --> 04:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
parents that's correct I am just saying
 
04:56:37.490 --> 04:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't solve the problem right
 
04:56:39.410 --> 04:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
if the child changes the name at school
 
04:56:39.420 --> 04:56:40.850 align:start position:0%
if the child changes the name at school
right

04:56:40.850 --> 04:56:40.860 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:56:43.550 --> 04:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
except now the parent distressed the
 
04:56:46.128 --> 04:56:46.138 align:start position:0%
teacher and looks on the neighbor's
 
04:56:49.550 --> 04:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:52.550 --> 04:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
so and I think that was that started off
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
as a question
 
04:56:57.350 --> 04:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
is is that within the framework of what
 
04:56:59.390 --> 04:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
you're saying here
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
are we asking kids to rat out their
 
04:57:04.550 --> 04:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
neighbors no
 
04:57:08.150 --> 04:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
no we are suggesting the possibility
 
04:57:10.430 --> 04:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
that if the teacher does not report
 
04:57:10.440 --> 04:57:11.868 align:start position:0%
that if the teacher does not report
something

04:57:11.868 --> 04:57:11.878 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:57:15.410 --> 04:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
and the neighbor's child does
 
04:57:17.810 --> 04:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
that now the parents have another reason
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
to distrust the teacher who's supposed
 
04:57:21.890 --> 04:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
to be working in tandem with the parents
 
04:57:24.530 --> 04:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm asking if the teacher
 
04:57:27.530 --> 04:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
does not report abuse then the teacher
 
04:57:29.930 --> 04:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
would be in violation of the law
 
04:57:33.708 --> 04:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:36.110 --> 04:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh I don't even remember what I was
 
04:57:38.628 --> 04:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
gonna ask I'm sorry I representative
 
04:57:40.730 --> 04:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
Raymond while representative Nelson
 
04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
remembers thank you Mr chairman I want
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
to get back to understanding the
 
04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
language of the Bell
 
04:57:47.448 --> 04:57:47.458 align:start position:0%
um and and kind of away from
 
04:57:47.458 --> 04:57:49.310 align:start position:0%
um and and kind of away from
hypothetical

04:57:49.310 --> 04:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
hypothetical
 
04:57:51.470 --> 04:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
um situations so
 
04:57:53.510 --> 04:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple of areas where I
 
04:57:56.270 --> 04:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
am still seeking understanding
 
04:58:00.410 --> 04:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
um the first one is page one line seven
 
04:58:02.570 --> 04:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
um it talks about
 
04:58:04.430 --> 04:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
um that information about a child
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be purposely withheld from
 
04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
their parents etc etc while the child is
 
04:58:10.430 --> 04:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
in the custody of the school district
 
04:58:13.070 --> 04:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's a really weird
 
04:58:15.110 --> 04:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
um phrase and I'm curious if you mean
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
while the child is attending school or
 
04:58:20.470 --> 04:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
and also whether this only applies to
 
04:58:22.910 --> 04:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
school public school districts or if
 
04:58:25.070 --> 04:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
this will also apply to Charter Schools
 
04:58:27.288 --> 04:58:27.298 align:start position:0%
and private schools well thank you for
 
04:58:28.670 --> 04:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
the question it is a good question
 
04:58:30.948 --> 04:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
actually yeah because the questions are
 
04:58:30.958 --> 04:58:31.810 align:start position:0%
actually yeah because the questions are
bad

04:58:31.810 --> 04:58:31.820 align:start position:0%
bad
 
04:58:34.730 --> 04:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
she's pretty good for first year there
 
04:58:36.350 --> 04:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
is a concept of what's called in loco
 
04:58:36.360 --> 04:58:37.610 align:start position:0%
is a concept of what's called in loco
parentis

04:58:37.610 --> 04:58:37.620 align:start position:0%
parentis
 
04:58:41.690 --> 04:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
and this this deals yeah so in here is
 
04:58:44.810 --> 04:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
the concept of in local parentis this is
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
actually down on the same page SEC uh
 
04:58:49.570 --> 04:58:49.580 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral three line 20
 
04:58:51.530 --> 04:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding a belly state region to
 
04:58:53.330 --> 04:58:53.340 align:start position:0%
the concept of in local parentis and any
 
04:58:55.610 --> 04:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
interpretation application thereof shall
 
04:58:56.930 --> 04:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
not infringe upon the natural and
 
04:58:59.150 --> 04:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
statutory rights of of parents as
 
04:59:00.830 --> 04:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
recognized in existing law or by
 
04:59:03.170 --> 04:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
adoption of this statute so this goes
 
04:59:04.930 --> 04:59:04.940 align:start position:0%
back up this relates to the concept of
 
04:59:10.970 --> 04:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
inloco-parentus so a a a school Acts
 
04:59:13.910 --> 04:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
as a representative of the parents with
 
04:59:15.970 --> 04:59:15.980 align:start position:0%
their given Authority and responsibility
 
04:59:18.288 --> 04:59:18.298 align:start position:0%
uh to to take care of the kids to
 
04:59:20.690 --> 04:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
educate the kids in lieu of the parents
 
04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
or in place of the parents so what I'm
 
04:59:23.930 --> 04:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
really getting at with the question
 
04:59:26.330 --> 04:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
though is by saying in the custody of
 
04:59:29.770 --> 04:59:29.780 align:start position:0%
the school district is this
 
04:59:32.330 --> 04:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
legally is this going to be interpreted
 
04:59:34.850 --> 04:59:34.860 align:start position:0%
as public school districts or does it
 
04:59:36.890 --> 04:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
cover private schools boarding schools
 
04:59:38.570 --> 04:59:38.580 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
04:59:41.650 --> 04:59:41.660 align:start position:0%
this should cover schools everyone
 
04:59:43.788 --> 04:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
because I noticed all the other places
 
04:59:46.250 --> 04:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
it just says schools which schools was
 
04:59:46.260 --> 04:59:47.628 align:start position:0%
it just says schools which schools was
helpful

04:59:47.628 --> 04:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
04:59:51.410 --> 04:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
if if you would need to to to remove the
 
04:59:53.628 --> 04:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
the district from there or or just
 
04:59:55.490 --> 04:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
because the phrase is freaking me out
 
04:59:55.500 --> 04:59:56.990 align:start position:0%
because the phrase is freaking me out
okay

04:59:56.990 --> 04:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:59:59.090 --> 04:59:59.100 align:start position:0%
um and then well it's it's a custody the
 
05:00:01.610 --> 05:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
children are at the school they're
 
05:00:03.530 --> 05:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
actually compelled to be at school right
 
05:00:06.230 --> 05:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
by the law and so that is they are in
 
05:00:08.570 --> 05:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
the in the temporary if you will custody
 
05:00:11.150 --> 05:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
of the school they have responsibility
 
05:00:14.690 --> 05:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
of the child for that period of time and
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
so while they are there parents don't
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
lose their rights because the child is
 
05:00:20.448 --> 05:00:20.458 align:start position:0%
not in their physical presence under
 
05:00:23.330 --> 05:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
their direct direct supervision they're
 
05:00:25.550 --> 05:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
at the school okay and so this does
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
apply to all schools uh but that that
 
05:00:30.890 --> 05:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
custody is it relates to in local
 
05:00:33.410 --> 05:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
parentis okay that's awesome and in
 
05:00:35.090 --> 05:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
addition with respect to in loco
 
05:00:37.730 --> 05:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
parentis the whole concept of in loco
 
05:00:42.288 --> 05:00:42.298 align:start position:0%
parentis implies that there is a uh de
 
05:00:44.990 --> 05:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
facto trust relationship that exists
 
05:00:48.110 --> 05:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
between the parents and the school or
 
05:00:49.850 --> 05:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
the parents and the and the health care
 
05:00:52.490 --> 05:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
provider such that
 
05:00:55.850 --> 05:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
the parents need to be knowledgeable of
 
05:00:58.070 --> 05:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
what it is that they have entrusted or
 
05:00:59.750 --> 05:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
their medical practitioner the parents
 
05:01:01.910 --> 05:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
need to know what they have entrusted
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
their children to that school and school
 
05:01:07.310 --> 05:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
Personnel teachers Educators Health Care
 
05:01:09.670 --> 05:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
Providers they need to understand
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh and have delineated what in fact that
 
05:01:14.930 --> 05:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
is and part of that goes to curriculum
 
05:01:16.970 --> 05:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
of course and we have laws that that
 
05:01:20.090 --> 05:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
speak to that but in loco parentis means
 
05:01:22.190 --> 05:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
there is an implied trust relationship
 
05:01:24.830 --> 05:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
between the parents and and the school
 
05:01:27.650 --> 05:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
that's fair and therefore therefore the
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
school officials are subsidiary to and
 
05:01:34.190 --> 05:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
should be supportive of the parents
 
05:01:36.770 --> 05:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
rather than to assume a complementary
 
05:01:40.850 --> 05:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
role or one that is uh that asserts that
 
05:01:42.350 --> 05:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
they have the same kind of authority
 
05:01:43.970 --> 05:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
that parents do
 
05:01:45.770 --> 05:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
and that's that's part of the issue
 
05:01:47.510 --> 05:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's in play here in the
 
05:01:49.250 --> 05:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
Manchester case which is I understand is
 
05:01:51.650 --> 05:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
on appeal okay yeah I would love to read
 
05:01:54.830 --> 05:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
up on that case um so on
 
05:01:57.590 --> 05:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
make a follow-up I would I have two
 
05:01:59.750 --> 05:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
other areas of language questions and
 
05:02:02.448 --> 05:02:02.458 align:start position:0%
then I'm done that was it so just if you
 
05:02:03.770 --> 05:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
can bear with me actually you're done
 
05:02:05.090 --> 05:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
when I say you're done but please
 
05:02:07.128 --> 05:02:07.138 align:start position:0%
continue thank you all right I'm Paige
 
05:02:08.930 --> 05:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
too many of us have watched C-SPAN and
 
05:02:10.788 --> 05:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
we think we're in Congress all right on
 
05:02:14.990 --> 05:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
page three uh uh line 26
 
05:02:17.150 --> 05:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
um it says uh item T the right to
 
05:02:18.830 --> 05:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
consent in writing before a record of
 
05:02:20.930 --> 05:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
their minor child's blood or DNA is
 
05:02:23.330 --> 05:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
created stored or shared Etc
 
05:02:25.490 --> 05:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
um this is not anywhere else in the law
 
05:02:28.670 --> 05:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm curious as to the Genesis of
 
05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
this and how it will affect secondary
 
05:02:33.170 --> 05:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
science classes who
 
05:02:36.708 --> 05:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
um occasionally do blood typing or
 
05:02:37.788 --> 05:02:37.798 align:start position:0%
um you know they do the gel
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
electrophoresis with DNA
 
05:02:41.510 --> 05:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
um you don't really learn anything
 
05:02:45.650 --> 05:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:47.750 --> 05:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
this this does not interfere with the
 
05:02:50.810 --> 05:02:50.820 align:start position:0%
education process a science class that
 
05:02:50.820 --> 05:02:51.830 align:start position:0%
education process a science class that
would

05:02:51.830 --> 05:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:02:53.570 --> 05:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
do blood type and we did that as well
 
05:02:55.910 --> 05:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't even think we had DNA back
 
05:02:57.830 --> 05:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
when I was in elementary school that's a
 
05:03:00.530 --> 05:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:04.430 --> 05:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
it's pretty fun actually but uh it's it
 
05:03:07.128 --> 05:03:07.138 align:start position:0%
the idea is that this um
 
05:03:10.930 --> 05:03:10.940 align:start position:0%
the the keeping of a of a DNA record
 
05:03:14.448 --> 05:03:14.458 align:start position:0%
this is all about uh your child's
 
05:03:16.730 --> 05:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
information being kept by someone
 
05:03:19.128 --> 05:03:19.138 align:start position:0%
somewhere for some reason and the
 
05:03:21.590 --> 05:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
parents would have the right to know
 
05:03:24.530 --> 05:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
who who's collecting the data
 
05:03:26.208 --> 05:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
this is not science class this is
 
05:03:28.368 --> 05:03:28.378 align:start position:0%
somebody collecting data on your child
 
05:03:30.770 --> 05:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
okay and then the last
 
05:03:33.288 --> 05:03:33.298 align:start position:0%
um one is on page six number five
 
05:03:35.570 --> 05:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
article seven
 
05:03:37.310 --> 05:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
um when you're talking about
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
consequences for violating the law
 
05:03:42.230 --> 05:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
um so it says in there that if you're
 
05:03:44.270 --> 05:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
found guilty knowingly violating any
 
05:03:47.448 --> 05:03:47.458 align:start position:0%
section of the law etc etc so my
 
05:03:51.350 --> 05:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
question is what is the
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
um vehicle by which this would be tried
 
05:03:56.150 --> 05:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
is it through an office of civil rights
 
05:03:57.948 --> 05:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
complaint is it through the Department
 
05:04:00.590 --> 05:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
of Education is it police are arresting
 
05:04:02.330 --> 05:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
people and then it's going through the
 
05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
criminal court process like who's making
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
that determination and what are the
 
05:04:10.970 --> 05:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
standards of evidence that will then be
 
05:04:10.980 --> 05:04:15.770 align:start position:0%
standards of evidence that will then be
required

05:04:15.770 --> 05:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
going back to the to the first point is
 
05:04:21.530 --> 05:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
that it would be a court of competent
 
05:04:21.540 --> 05:04:23.270 align:start position:0%
that it would be a court of competent
jurisdiction

05:04:23.270 --> 05:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
05:04:25.788 --> 05:04:25.798 align:start position:0%
it starts out as a civil action that's
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
step one actually step one would be a
 
05:04:29.930 --> 05:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
complaint right I mean one would expect
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
that a parent would call up the
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
principal and say I have a complaint go
 
05:04:34.550 --> 05:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
through the Normal public complaint
 
05:04:36.288 --> 05:04:36.298 align:start position:0%
process so so we've gotten No
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
Satisfaction whatsoever Step One is a
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
civil action
 
05:04:41.170 --> 05:04:41.180 align:start position:0%
if the teacher
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
continues down that it becomes a
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
criminal action
 
05:04:48.050 --> 05:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
so it would be the the parent would have
 
05:04:51.650 --> 05:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
the right to file a a complaint
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
this would be tried in a court of law
 
05:04:56.510 --> 05:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
because it's a violation of a civil
 
05:04:58.850 --> 05:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
right so does this parent have to
 
05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
potentially hire an attorney and file
 
05:05:03.530 --> 05:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
their own civil complaint do they go to
 
05:05:05.510 --> 05:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
the department do they go to the
 
05:05:07.910 --> 05:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education like how do they
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
because right now there's a system right
 
05:05:12.050 --> 05:05:12.060 align:start position:0%
you appeal appeal representative you're
 
05:05:14.030 --> 05:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
going on way too far sorry I'm just
 
05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
leave the question and let them ask it
 
05:05:19.610 --> 05:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
please all right answer it excuse me
 
05:05:22.368 --> 05:05:22.378 align:start position:0%
it is a legal process
 
05:05:24.948 --> 05:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
the burden of filing the complaint is on
 
05:05:26.628 --> 05:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
the parent if they believe that their
 
05:05:28.730 --> 05:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
rights have been violated then they file
 
05:05:30.770 --> 05:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
the complaint on that
 
05:05:33.110 --> 05:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
than whether it be a trial there'd be
 
05:05:37.490 --> 05:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
the the the uh the what evidence would
 
05:05:39.650 --> 05:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
be necessary to convict for a for a
 
05:05:42.050 --> 05:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
class A misdemeanor that's what the
 
05:05:44.090 --> 05:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
judges are to decide
 
05:05:46.730 --> 05:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from
 
05:05:49.788 --> 05:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
anyone else who hasn't asked gets first
 
05:05:53.208 --> 05:05:53.218 align:start position:0%
dibs representative ball
 
05:05:55.128 --> 05:05:55.138 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson and thank you gave my
 
05:05:55.138 --> 05:05:56.690 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson and thank you gave my
question

05:05:56.690 --> 05:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:05:56.700 --> 05:05:57.590 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:05:57.590 --> 05:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:59.570 --> 05:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
I worked in a middle school as the
 
05:06:02.270 --> 05:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
emotional behavioral specialist which
 
05:06:04.490 --> 05:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
provided me a lot of opportunity to work
 
05:06:07.610 --> 05:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
with parents of children who were having
 
05:06:09.050 --> 05:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
difficulties whether it was emotionally
 
05:06:11.810 --> 05:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
or oftentimes behaviorally
 
05:06:13.490 --> 05:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
um would you agree that actually
 
05:06:16.788 --> 05:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
including the parent in those meetings
 
05:06:18.770 --> 05:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
that we had to address the children's
 
05:06:24.110 --> 05:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
um Ashley made the allowed the child to
 
05:06:29.690 --> 05:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
feel safer at home because we now I
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
wrote a town we now had an Avenue to
 
05:06:34.310 --> 05:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
provide help for the parents and
 
05:06:36.770 --> 05:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
education which in special education we
 
05:06:39.530 --> 05:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
must educate the parents on the child
 
05:06:41.208 --> 05:06:41.218 align:start position:0%
um disability I'm not saying that this
 
05:06:42.890 --> 05:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
is disability but
 
05:06:45.310 --> 05:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
um but it does provide that opportunity
 
05:06:48.050 --> 05:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
to educate the parent and it also puts
 
05:06:50.208 --> 05:06:50.218 align:start position:0%
the parent on notice that we know the
 
05:06:52.128 --> 05:06:52.138 align:start position:0%
child is going home is something that
 
05:06:55.550 --> 05:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
may not make the parent happy and we
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
made sure the parent knew we would be
 
05:07:00.770 --> 05:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
checking in with the child frequently to
 
05:07:02.690 --> 05:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
be sure they continue to feel safe at
 
05:07:04.850 --> 05:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
home absolutely so you agree with that
 
05:07:04.860 --> 05:07:06.288 align:start position:0%
home absolutely so you agree with that
absolutely

05:07:06.288 --> 05:07:06.298 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
05:07:06.298 --> 05:07:06.948 align:start position:0%
absolutely
um

05:07:06.948 --> 05:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:15.230 --> 05:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
that we've
 
05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
we've um testimonies saying that the
 
05:07:20.650 --> 05:07:20.660 align:start position:0%
dance children
 
05:07:22.910 --> 05:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
tended to me more like I think that was
 
05:07:25.070 --> 05:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
very high 19 more likely to commit
 
05:07:28.310 --> 05:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
suicide and so what concerns me is if we
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
don't would you agree that if we don't
 
05:07:32.750 --> 05:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
include the parents in on this
 
05:07:32.760 --> 05:07:34.910 align:start position:0%
include the parents in on this
conversation

05:07:34.910 --> 05:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
um aren't we putting the child at more
 
05:07:38.930 --> 05:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
risk at home to lead a double life and
 
05:07:40.850 --> 05:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to share this with the
 
05:07:43.850 --> 05:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
parent and get the help they need as a
 
05:07:47.750 --> 05:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
family unit absolutely absolutely it
 
05:07:50.868 --> 05:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
goes back to the keeping of Secrets uh a
 
05:07:53.090 --> 05:07:53.100 align:start position:0%
young man who's a friend of my family my
 
05:07:55.368 --> 05:07:55.378 align:start position:0%
son one of my sons
 
05:07:57.530 --> 05:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
um we did not find out or his parents
 
05:07:59.810 --> 05:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
didn't find out until he was 25 years
 
05:08:02.690 --> 05:08:02.700 align:start position:0%
old that he had been molested by a man
 
05:08:04.010 --> 05:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
in his church
 
05:08:05.810 --> 05:08:05.820 align:start position:0%
it happened when he was nine years old
 
05:08:08.270 --> 05:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
kept it a secret
 
05:08:11.230 --> 05:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
it wound up destroying him so that he he
 
05:08:16.150 --> 05:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:19.250 --> 05:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
when secrets are kept families and their
 
05:08:22.250 --> 05:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
and individual lives are destroyed
 
05:08:24.350 --> 05:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
schools should be fostering a
 
05:08:26.390 --> 05:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
communication between the children and
 
05:08:29.150 --> 05:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
the parents if they're mediators in the
 
05:08:32.030 --> 05:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
to facilitate that conversation God
 
05:08:33.650 --> 05:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
bless them for being that that that
 
05:08:36.410 --> 05:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
mediator that referee during those
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
awkward uh adolescent years whatever the
 
05:08:41.690 --> 05:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
regardless of the situation someone's
 
05:08:44.090 --> 05:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
being bullied at school somebody who's
 
05:08:45.650 --> 05:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
coming out of the closet or whatever
 
05:08:47.628 --> 05:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
whatever this it doesn't matter what the
 
05:08:51.170 --> 05:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
situation is parents if that the schools
 
05:08:54.288 --> 05:08:54.298 align:start position:0%
can provide an um an incredible resource
 
05:08:56.750 --> 05:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
to provide that relationship between the
 
05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
parents and the children I think it's
 
05:09:00.708 --> 05:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
essential thank you

05:09:28.128 --> 05:09:28.138 align:start position:0%
of the school isn't bound to freely
 
05:09:31.250 --> 05:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
um share the information once received
 
05:09:34.850 --> 05:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
but actually would only be required to
 
05:09:36.410 --> 05:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
share information
 
05:09:41.448 --> 05:09:41.458 align:start position:0%
if the parent asks inquires yes and
 
05:09:44.690 --> 05:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
that's a very important point the parent
 
05:09:47.868 --> 05:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
has the the burden is placed on the
 
05:09:51.288 --> 05:09:51.298 align:start position:0%
parent to ask for the information
 
05:09:55.010 --> 05:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
the the school is then obligated to not
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
lie to the parents and actually provide
 
05:10:00.288 --> 05:10:00.298 align:start position:0%
correct information adequate information
 
05:10:03.530 --> 05:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
so it's upon inquiry that the that the
 
05:10:05.628 --> 05:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
parent receives the information it is
 
05:10:09.050 --> 05:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
only required on the school when it's a
 
05:10:11.990 --> 05:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporting situation otherwise
 
05:10:12.000 --> 05:10:13.550 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporting situation otherwise
not

05:10:13.550 --> 05:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:10:15.948 --> 05:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
correct as detailed in the in the in the
 
05:10:18.410 --> 05:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
law correct just clarify yes I have a
 
05:10:20.690 --> 05:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman if okay if you
 
05:10:22.788 --> 05:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
don't mind thank you Mr chairman thank
 
05:10:25.368 --> 05:10:25.378 align:start position:0%
you for taking my follow-up and my
 
05:10:28.250 --> 05:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up would be this inquiry would be
 
05:10:31.788 --> 05:10:31.798 align:start position:0%
at the time asked so it wouldn't be like
 
05:10:34.788 --> 05:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
a standing order inquiry where the
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
parent would be allowed to say
 
05:10:40.970 --> 05:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
I'm inquiring and this inquiry lasts the
 
05:10:44.448 --> 05:10:44.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:46.368 --> 05:10:46.378 align:start position:0%
hadn't really thought about a standing
 
05:10:48.350 --> 05:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
order I've been out of the Navy for 10
 
05:10:50.570 --> 05:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
years now so
 
05:10:53.628 --> 05:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
um no it is upon inquiry it's not a
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
standing order if if my son ever changes
 
05:10:58.490 --> 05:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
his pronouns you will tell me no it's a
 
05:11:01.070 --> 05:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
they need it's the constant
 
05:11:06.288 --> 05:11:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:08.690 --> 05:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:11:12.590 --> 05:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
accept for representative logs
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman welcome
 
05:11:18.230 --> 05:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I'm just trying to get the
 
05:11:21.050 --> 05:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
need of this uh you know as a parent I
 
05:11:23.030 --> 05:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
never depended on my children to give me
 
05:11:24.830 --> 05:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
any information they weren't going to do
 
05:11:28.128 --> 05:11:28.138 align:start position:0%
that it was my job to know my child my
 
05:11:29.448 --> 05:11:29.458 align:start position:0%
job to know my child if there's
 
05:11:30.770 --> 05:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
something I didn't know about my child
 
05:11:32.628 --> 05:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not sitting sitting down and having
 
05:11:34.970 --> 05:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
a conversation with my child enough so
 
05:11:37.610 --> 05:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
the I'm glad you answered the question I
 
05:11:39.110 --> 05:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
had the same question with respect to
 
05:11:41.208 --> 05:11:41.218 align:start position:0%
the school district meaning just the
 
05:11:44.510 --> 05:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
public schools you're saying no then uh
 
05:11:47.810 --> 05:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
when you look at page six
 
05:11:51.110 --> 05:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
um the uh on nine and eleven
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh 2500 be restricted from any further
 
05:11:58.368 --> 05:11:58.378 align:start position:0%
access to all schools in the district so
 
05:12:01.190 --> 05:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
if I'm at St Paul's School in Concord
 
05:12:03.590 --> 05:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm a teacher that violated I get a
 
05:12:05.868 --> 05:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
twenty five hundred dollar fine I cannot
 
05:12:08.750 --> 05:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
teach in Concord for a year uh actually
 
05:12:11.510 --> 05:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
that 2500 fine is for a contractor or
 
05:12:13.368 --> 05:12:13.378 align:start position:0%
third party employed by the school that
 
05:12:16.490 --> 05:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
violates the section yes okay and okay
 
05:12:19.150 --> 05:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
so has it that'd be like the custodian
 
05:12:22.850 --> 05:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
or an outside vendor that comes in and
 
05:12:24.590 --> 05:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
makes a presentation okay so I'm a
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
custodian at St Paul's and I and I'm
 
05:12:29.090 --> 05:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
violating this I can't be a custodian at
 
05:12:30.770 --> 05:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
any school in Concord
 
05:12:30.780 --> 05:12:31.970 align:start position:0%
any school in Concord
District

05:12:31.970 --> 05:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
District
 
05:12:34.250 --> 05:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
it is Saint Paul's in Concord
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
correct nope okay
 
05:12:36.600 --> 05:12:38.628 align:start position:0%
correct nope okay
it

05:12:38.628 --> 05:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:12:40.250 --> 05:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
yes okay but I could go to Manchester
 
05:12:44.830 --> 05:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
but you could apply
 
05:12:50.510 --> 05:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
well like Canada you could you could
 
05:12:51.948 --> 05:12:51.958 align:start position:0%
have you're not prohibited by the
 
05:12:55.010 --> 05:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
language in in this particular in these
 
05:12:56.810 --> 05:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
in these sentences okay you could apply
 
05:13:00.230 --> 05:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
and um assuming uh you have honest
 
05:13:02.330 --> 05:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
references that that District would have
 
05:13:04.430 --> 05:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not it opted to
 
05:13:06.470 --> 05:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
employ you whereas the other District
 
05:13:08.330 --> 05:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
could not for one year yes that's
 
05:13:08.340 --> 05:13:09.170 align:start position:0%
could not for one year yes that's
correct

05:13:09.170 --> 05:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:13:12.050 --> 05:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
okay so so the other the other District
 
05:13:14.390 --> 05:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
if I could follow up the other the other
 
05:13:17.150 --> 05:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
District that I'm applying for this
 
05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't prohibit them from hiring me
 
05:13:21.830 --> 05:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't
 
05:13:24.650 --> 05:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
so it would be an unfair
 
05:13:24.660 --> 05:13:26.628 align:start position:0%
so it would be an unfair
labor

05:13:26.628 --> 05:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
labor
 
05:13:28.250 --> 05:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it'd be NFA Labor
 
05:13:30.890 --> 05:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
practice but it would be unfair labor
 
05:13:33.708 --> 05:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
law that they wouldn't refuse to hire me
 
05:13:35.868 --> 05:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
because of the incident I had at St
 
05:13:35.878 --> 05:13:37.430 align:start position:0%
because of the incident I had at St
Paul's

05:13:37.430 --> 05:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
Paul's
 
05:13:41.448 --> 05:13:41.458 align:start position:0%
because where does the Lord state that
 
05:13:43.788 --> 05:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
they can't hire me
 
05:13:43.798 --> 05:13:45.910 align:start position:0%
they can't hire me
right

05:13:45.910 --> 05:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:13:49.610 --> 05:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
well if you believe that if if you're if
 
05:13:51.770 --> 05:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
your reasoning is correct here and I'm
 
05:13:53.570 --> 05:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
not challenging it but if your reason
 
05:13:56.330 --> 05:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
Bears out as being correct then you
 
05:13:57.770 --> 05:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
would want to make some sort of a change
 
05:13:59.448 --> 05:13:59.458 align:start position:0%
here because you don't want to have an
 
05:14:02.390 --> 05:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
unfair Labor practice in in in the law
 
05:14:05.270 --> 05:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
right okay so so either gonna take it
 
05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
out entirely or what you're going to do
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
is you're going to make it applicable in
 
05:14:11.510 --> 05:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
every school district throughout the
 
05:14:13.970 --> 05:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
state so it's either for everybody or
 
05:14:16.550 --> 05:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
for nobody okay yeah I think that's a
 
05:14:18.288 --> 05:14:18.298 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a good option I
 
05:14:20.990 --> 05:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you so uh just one
 
05:14:24.230 --> 05:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
more question which the um
 
05:14:26.990 --> 05:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
all the all the laws that are here
 
05:14:29.208 --> 05:14:29.218 align:start position:0%
federal or statutory laws are there
 
05:14:32.390 --> 05:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:34.788 --> 05:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
so my teacher didn't tell me that my son
 
05:14:36.590 --> 05:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
has joined a
 
05:14:36.600 --> 05:14:38.150 align:start position:0%
has joined a
um

05:14:38.150 --> 05:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:41.090 --> 05:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
joined a rugby uh club that I told them
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
I didn't want him to be in a rugby class
 
05:14:46.430 --> 05:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
the rugby I didn't want to play in rugby
 
05:14:49.250 --> 05:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
so they didn't they didn't tell me
 
05:14:51.288 --> 05:14:51.298 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:14:55.730 --> 05:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
do I have remedies now that it's statute
 
05:14:58.670 --> 05:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
I've not found any remedies where if if
 
05:15:01.788 --> 05:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
the teacher allows or the school allows
 
05:15:03.770 --> 05:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
your child to participate in an activity
 
05:15:05.510 --> 05:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
joins the Rugby Club against your
 
05:15:07.430 --> 05:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
permission or without your permission or
 
05:15:09.770 --> 05:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
without your knowledge I have I've not
 
05:15:11.628 --> 05:15:11.638 align:start position:0%
found where there is any remedy today
 
05:15:14.330 --> 05:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
and then you inquire and then you're
 
05:15:14.340 --> 05:15:15.530 align:start position:0%
and then you inquire and then you're
told

05:15:15.530 --> 05:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
told
 
05:15:18.050 --> 05:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
and then you say I I don't want my child
 
05:15:20.330 --> 05:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
participating in the chess club or rugby
 
05:15:22.310 --> 05:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
or whatever I'm not aware of there being
 
05:15:22.320 --> 05:15:23.270 align:start position:0%
or whatever I'm not aware of there being
any

05:15:23.270 --> 05:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
um any sanction for that at this time so
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
the answer is no I don't we don't know
 
05:15:32.810 --> 05:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:34.970 --> 05:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr chairman you know
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
thank you take my question
 
05:15:38.030 --> 05:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
what about
 
05:15:41.868 --> 05:15:41.878 align:start position:0%
uh police or sros can I go up to them
 
05:15:43.010 --> 05:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
and say I want to know what my children
 
05:15:45.708 --> 05:15:45.718 align:start position:0%

kinds of information on students that's
 
05:16:04.490 --> 05:16:04.500 align:start position:0%

before it happens
 
05:16:15.650 --> 05:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:18.350 --> 05:16:18.360 align:start position:0%

05:16:20.810 --> 05:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
they are they are
 
05:16:23.690 --> 05:16:23.700 align:start position:0%
they are employees but they are some of
 
05:16:25.010 --> 05:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
them may be employees some of them may
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
be third party because they may be not
 
05:16:29.270 --> 05:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
actually part of the school or school
 
05:16:31.310 --> 05:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
that they might be and a police
 
05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
department an actual police officer of
 
05:16:36.890 --> 05:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
say Concord Police Department I don't
 
05:16:39.470 --> 05:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
know each School may be different uh but
 
05:16:43.670 --> 05:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
if they are we do not specify that sros
 
05:16:45.708 --> 05:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
would would that the parent could go and
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
inquire it about the at the school
 
05:16:52.810 --> 05:16:52.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:56.810 --> 05:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
well I think the question is um what is
 
05:16:58.430 --> 05:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
the chain of accountability here with
 
05:17:00.230 --> 05:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
respect to the employment of the school
 
05:17:02.628 --> 05:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
resource officer is the school resource
 
05:17:05.510 --> 05:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
officer and employee of the school or is
 
05:17:08.510 --> 05:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
the school res officer an employee of
 
05:17:11.448 --> 05:17:11.458 align:start position:0%
the of the local police department in
 
05:17:13.910 --> 05:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
which case that would then give us an
 
05:17:16.730 --> 05:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
indication of where we need to uh to
 
05:17:17.690 --> 05:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
raise some further questions
 
05:17:19.788 --> 05:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
particularly if it's the police
 
05:17:22.010 --> 05:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
department in my school district if I
 
05:17:25.190 --> 05:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
may the school pays for the uh police
 
05:17:28.250 --> 05:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
officer during the school hours
 
05:17:31.250 --> 05:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's on the warrant right now okay but I
 
05:17:33.170 --> 05:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
that's a resource talk about you know we
 
05:17:35.448 --> 05:17:35.458 align:start position:0%
want information that's their job is to
 
05:17:37.430 --> 05:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
gather information and I'm saying you
 
05:17:38.750 --> 05:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
know maybe it's a good idea parents know
 
05:17:38.760 --> 05:17:39.890 align:start position:0%
know maybe it's a good idea parents know
what

05:17:39.890 --> 05:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:17:42.110 --> 05:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
what's going that's the place early
 
05:17:44.330 --> 05:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
ought to know the parents have the right
 
05:17:47.208 --> 05:17:47.218 align:start position:0%
to the information
 
05:17:48.530 --> 05:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
that's what we're getting at is the
 
05:17:50.030 --> 05:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
parents have the right to make the
 
05:17:52.490 --> 05:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
inquiry and obtain the information well
 
05:17:54.590 --> 05:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
do we have a confidential issue going on
 
05:17:54.600 --> 05:17:55.430 align:start position:0%
do we have a confidential issue going on
here

05:17:55.430 --> 05:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:17:59.330 --> 05:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
a confidential issue with juvenile they
 
05:18:00.410 --> 05:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
haven't committed a crime but they
 
05:18:01.970 --> 05:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
gather the information about you know
 
05:18:04.310 --> 05:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
sexting and that sort of thing
 
05:18:06.050 --> 05:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
and but the parents aren't I'm not sure
 
05:18:07.670 --> 05:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
if they're getting the information
 
05:18:09.230 --> 05:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
about it
 
05:18:11.868 --> 05:18:11.878 align:start position:0%
I was just
 
05:18:14.270 --> 05:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
well once again the only way that they
 
05:18:17.208 --> 05:18:17.218 align:start position:0%
would be able to uh to to to gain such
 
05:18:18.890 --> 05:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
information would be to make an inquiry
 
05:18:20.330 --> 05:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
of the school resource officer because
 
05:18:22.070 --> 05:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
the school resource officer is not
 
05:18:24.650 --> 05:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
required to contact the parents and tell
 
05:18:27.050 --> 05:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
the parents uh under the under under the
 
05:18:28.670 --> 05:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
provisions of of this proposed
 
05:18:31.128 --> 05:18:31.138 align:start position:0%
legislation now the school resource
 
05:18:33.708 --> 05:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
officer it may be a policy of the school
 
05:18:36.948 --> 05:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
it may be a policy in the community that
 
05:18:39.170 --> 05:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh that the school resource officer is
 
05:18:41.750 --> 05:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
obligated to do that but that that's
 
05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
separate from what is encompassed within
 
05:18:46.490 --> 05:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:18:49.128 --> 05:18:49.138 align:start position:0%
yeah right okay okay I'm disappointed as
 
05:18:51.110 --> 05:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
we currently understand it well uh it
 
05:18:53.570 --> 05:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
you know it we thought it was perfect
 
05:18:55.368 --> 05:18:55.378 align:start position:0%
but maybe it's not quite there yet and
 
05:18:57.410 --> 05:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
maybe you could help to perfect it yeah
 
05:18:58.850 --> 05:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:58.860 --> 05:19:00.170 align:start position:0%
thank you
seriously

05:19:00.170 --> 05:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
05:19:03.708 --> 05:19:03.718 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming up here uh
 
05:19:06.288 --> 05:19:06.298 align:start position:0%
representative would you like your
 
05:19:08.150 --> 05:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
presentation uh yes and I'm going to
 
05:19:10.788 --> 05:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
truncate this out of Mercy for uh the
 
05:19:13.310 --> 05:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
members of the public is behind me and
 
05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
just for the Reformation of the public
 
05:19:17.090 --> 05:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
if everyone who signed the pink card
 
05:19:18.890 --> 05:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
speaks for 10 minutes
 
05:19:22.610 --> 05:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
it is 10 hours we will be here yeah
 
05:19:24.650 --> 05:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
you're not going to testify for 10
 
05:19:26.868 --> 05:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
minutes you're going to testify for two
 
05:19:29.390 --> 05:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
because we are kind to you
 
05:19:32.208 --> 05:19:32.218 align:start position:0%
so if you had a long testimony this is
 
05:19:33.890 --> 05:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
the good time to boil it down to two
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
minutes the last hearing demonstrated it
 
05:19:36.948 --> 05:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
could be done
 
05:19:39.948 --> 05:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
go so thank you I'm I thank you
 
05:19:42.230 --> 05:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues for the opportunity I'm
 
05:19:43.670 --> 05:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
pleased to be once again be able to
 
05:19:46.368 --> 05:19:46.378 align:start position:0%
speak in support of hb10 this year's
 
05:19:48.770 --> 05:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
version of the parents Rights bill uh
 
05:19:50.810 --> 05:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
the the version that I sponsored uh last
 
05:19:52.850 --> 05:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
year along with uh Jeff is a co-sponsor
 
05:19:55.310 --> 05:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
almost made it we hope that it will be
 
05:19:59.330 --> 05:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
uh uh sufficiently if acceptable uh to
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
Representatives such that it can pass
 
05:20:04.368 --> 05:20:04.378 align:start position:0%
this year uh remembering that no piece
 
05:20:07.970 --> 05:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
of legislation is uh is perfect and if
 
05:20:11.208 --> 05:20:11.218 align:start position:0%
it needs to be tweaked in as we as the
 
05:20:12.890 --> 05:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
saying goes in the future of course
 
05:20:15.650 --> 05:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
we're more than willing for that to be
 
05:20:18.770 --> 05:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
supportive of those uh suggestions
 
05:20:20.570 --> 05:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
um I believe we're in the throes of a
 
05:20:22.070 --> 05:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
great philosophical and political
 
05:20:23.930 --> 05:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
struggle that goes to the heart of the
 
05:20:27.170 --> 05:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
question of the proper role in place of
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
Educators and health care providers for
 
05:20:31.850 --> 05:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
minor children in relationship to the
 
05:20:33.770 --> 05:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
children whose parents have entrusted to
 
05:20:35.930 --> 05:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
them for their educations in health care
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
including the skull of both
 
05:20:42.110 --> 05:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
the Educators and the healthcare
 
05:20:44.750 --> 05:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
professionals what we know is that the
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
judicial record is clear
 
05:20:49.850 --> 05:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
a child according to the fourth Circuit
 
05:20:52.490 --> 05:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
Court of Appeals and their decision was
 
05:20:53.810 --> 05:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
not appealed to the Supreme Court
 
05:20:56.448 --> 05:20:56.458 align:start position:0%
therefore this their ruling in this
 
05:20:59.270 --> 05:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
opinion stands is quote not the mere
 
05:21:01.850 --> 05:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
creature creature of the state
 
05:21:04.310 --> 05:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
close quote now this is an important
 
05:21:06.410 --> 05:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
assertion uh or recognition and
 
05:21:08.570 --> 05:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
assertion in my view and the reason for
 
05:21:10.190 --> 05:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
that is because we have actually had
 
05:21:10.200 --> 05:21:11.448 align:start position:0%
that is because we have actually had
countries

05:21:11.448 --> 05:21:11.458 align:start position:0%
countries
 
05:21:14.690 --> 05:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
in within the 20th century that we can
 
05:21:16.730 --> 05:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
look back upon who asserted that
 
05:21:18.770 --> 05:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
children were actually the property of
 
05:21:20.330 --> 05:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:21:22.610 --> 05:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
maybe most of you are so young you do
 
05:21:25.010 --> 05:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
not remember the Soviet Union but that
 
05:21:27.948 --> 05:21:27.958 align:start position:0%
was the case in Bolshevik and stalinist
 
05:21:30.050 --> 05:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
Soviet Union
 
05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
we take a different view here in this in
 
05:21:34.430 --> 05:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
this country and we're clear that a
 
05:21:36.288 --> 05:21:36.298 align:start position:0%
child is quote not the mere creature of
 
05:21:37.368 --> 05:21:37.378 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:21:39.170 --> 05:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
that decision was Troxel versus
 
05:21:42.590 --> 05:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
Granville in the year 2000 further the
 
05:21:44.448 --> 05:21:44.458 align:start position:0%
Court ruled and declared quote it is
 
05:21:47.390 --> 05:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
difficult to Envision why a school
 
05:21:50.448 --> 05:21:50.458 align:start position:0%
would even claim much less how a school
 
05:21:53.208 --> 05:21:53.218 align:start position:0%
could establish a generalized interest
 
05:21:55.368 --> 05:21:55.378 align:start position:0%
in withholding or concealing from the
 
05:21:57.850 --> 05:21:57.860 align:start position:0%
parents of minor children information
 
05:22:00.550 --> 05:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
fundamental to a child's identity
 
05:22:03.530 --> 05:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
personhood and mental and emotional
 
05:22:05.570 --> 05:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
well-being such as their preferred name
 
05:22:08.570 --> 05:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
and pronouns close quote
 
05:22:10.670 --> 05:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
I didn't even know that we were
 
05:22:13.850 --> 05:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
discussing such things in 2000 I was too
 
05:22:16.010 --> 05:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
busy parenting I guess
 
05:22:18.410 --> 05:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
so therefore absent any established
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
compelling State interests the right of
 
05:22:22.368 --> 05:22:22.378 align:start position:0%
parents to determine the educations in
 
05:22:25.850 --> 05:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
health care of their children is primary
 
05:22:28.670 --> 05:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
inherent in such a recognition is a
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
tenet that parents have a right to know
 
05:22:32.570 --> 05:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
what their children are being taught and
 
05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
how they're being treated by ones who
 
05:22:36.288 --> 05:22:36.298 align:start position:0%
stand in a de facto and professionally
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
determined relationship of Trustee of
 
05:22:41.750 --> 05:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
parents and to their into whom they are
 
05:22:43.550 --> 05:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
therefore accountable
 
05:22:45.948 --> 05:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
I believe that the greatest point of
 
05:22:48.050 --> 05:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
tension in our time is the teaching of
 
05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
children by school Personnel that their
 
05:22:52.550 --> 05:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
gender identity is fluid in a matter of
 
05:22:52.560 --> 05:22:54.590 align:start position:0%
gender identity is fluid in a matter of
choice

05:22:54.590 --> 05:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
choice
 
05:22:57.288 --> 05:22:57.298 align:start position:0%
but more is the assertion that the
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
teaching of these precepts is protected
 
05:23:01.490 --> 05:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
against parental inquiry
 
05:23:03.530 --> 05:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
they're being claimed by many that a
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
parent has no right to know
 
05:23:08.510 --> 05:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
what this amounts to is an assertion of
 
05:23:10.670 --> 05:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
a right that has no basis in law or
 
05:23:10.680 --> 05:23:11.868 align:start position:0%
a right that has no basis in law or
nature

05:23:11.868 --> 05:23:11.878 align:start position:0%
nature
 
05:23:14.030 --> 05:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
and that effectively challenges the
 
05:23:16.250 --> 05:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
primary role of a parent to direct the
 
05:23:19.970 --> 05:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
upbringing and care of children
 
05:23:22.910 --> 05:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
in one sense hb10 is a corrective to
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
this departure from law and historic
 
05:23:27.650 --> 05:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
practice but in another and even just as
 
05:23:30.410 --> 05:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
more important sense and I want to
 
05:23:31.788 --> 05:23:31.798 align:start position:0%
underscore this
 
05:23:33.708 --> 05:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
because it's it's a perspective that
 
05:23:37.250 --> 05:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
only was begun to be scratched at here a
 
05:23:40.368 --> 05:23:40.378 align:start position:0%
little while ago hb10 provides for
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
greater clarity
 
05:23:44.750 --> 05:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
in the proper role of Educators and
 
05:23:46.730 --> 05:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
health care providers with regard to
 
05:23:48.470 --> 05:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
their relationship with both parents and
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
children while in one sense it may be
 
05:23:53.570 --> 05:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
seen as a corrective in a larger sense
 
05:23:55.970 --> 05:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
it serves the purpose of advancing the
 
05:23:58.610 --> 05:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
people's will to better Define and
 
05:24:00.650 --> 05:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
encourage greater Trust
 
05:24:02.930 --> 05:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
between schools and their personnel
 
05:24:04.970 --> 05:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers parents and their
 
05:24:08.810 --> 05:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
children hb10 recognizes that parents
 
05:24:10.970 --> 05:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
and Guardians have multiple statutory
 
05:24:13.368 --> 05:24:13.378 align:start position:0%
rights to direct the education and care
 
05:24:15.170 --> 05:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
of their minor children
 
05:24:17.930 --> 05:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
regrettably not all parents children and
 
05:24:19.850 --> 05:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
school Personnel are aware of these
 
05:24:21.890 --> 05:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
statutory rights
 
05:24:24.890 --> 05:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
what hb10 accomplishes is the bringing
 
05:24:27.770 --> 05:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
together in one place so to speak an
 
05:24:30.850 --> 05:24:30.860 align:start position:0%
enumeration of these rights establishes
 
05:24:35.570 --> 05:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
a handful of new ones wxy and requires
 
05:24:37.970 --> 05:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
that all affected parties be made aware
 
05:24:40.128 --> 05:24:40.138 align:start position:0%
of what they are
 
05:24:42.708 --> 05:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
we have a right we have a responsibility
 
05:24:46.310 --> 05:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
to inform parents what their rights are
 
05:24:49.010 --> 05:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
and what their responsibilities are
 
05:24:51.590 --> 05:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
in my life and career I devoted a great
 
05:24:53.510 --> 05:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
deal of time to help people know what
 
05:24:55.490 --> 05:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
they did not know
 
05:24:57.890 --> 05:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
and to encourage them to live into the
 
05:24:59.448 --> 05:24:59.458 align:start position:0%
knowledge and practice of those things
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
that would raise their quality of life
 
05:25:03.288 --> 05:25:03.298 align:start position:0%
and enhance their relationships with
 
05:25:06.890 --> 05:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
others and this is how I see hb10 not as
 
05:25:08.868 --> 05:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
a weapon
 
05:25:11.090 --> 05:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
but as a tool
 
05:25:14.030 --> 05:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
a tool for parents and Educators and
 
05:25:16.430 --> 05:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
Health Care practitioners to more
 
05:25:19.310 --> 05:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
effectively work together to care for
 
05:25:21.288 --> 05:25:21.298 align:start position:0%
children to which each respectively and
 
05:25:24.230 --> 05:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
specifically have been entrusted
 
05:25:26.810 --> 05:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
parents are at the center yes and they
 
05:25:30.530 --> 05:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
are the primary decision makers yes
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
professional Educators and health care
 
05:25:35.570 --> 05:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
providers are resource persons
 
05:25:38.110 --> 05:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
their helpers
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
clarifying and securing these roles in
 
05:25:44.448 --> 05:25:44.458 align:start position:0%
relationships is in view in hb10 and so
 
05:25:46.190 --> 05:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
I urge that you consider it favorably
 
05:25:47.690 --> 05:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
and move it forward for the betterment
 
05:25:49.850 --> 05:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
of everyone here in the state of New
 
05:25:53.330 --> 05:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:56.330 --> 05:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative before we move
 
05:25:59.030 --> 05:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
on to testimony I have uh about two
 
05:26:01.490 --> 05:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
minutes for the committee
 
05:26:05.990 --> 05:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
um next Tuesday is town meeting day
 
05:26:08.150 --> 05:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
and the note came from our committee
 
05:26:11.030 --> 05:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
assistant would we be interested
 
05:26:14.690 --> 05:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
therefore in changing the day of our
 
05:26:17.590 --> 05:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
meeting next week to Wednesday
 
05:26:20.750 --> 05:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
the chairman of Judiciary who normally
 
05:26:23.628 --> 05:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
gets this room on Wednesdays will not be
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
needing it next Wednesday so we could
 
05:26:29.150 --> 05:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
meet here and not at stores garage
 
05:26:32.208 --> 05:26:32.218 align:start position:0%
but it's just are you thinking this is a
 
05:26:34.910 --> 05:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
good idea I can be here either day are
 
05:26:36.830 --> 05:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
you interested in Tuesday next week town
 
05:26:39.170 --> 05:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
meeting day will affect some of you or
 
05:26:39.180 --> 05:26:41.628 align:start position:0%
meeting day will affect some of you or
Wednesday

05:26:41.628 --> 05:26:41.638 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
05:26:43.850 --> 05:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
you're good you look good you look very
 
05:26:45.530 --> 05:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
good yeah but that's not what you meant
 
05:26:48.770 --> 05:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
is it no okay how many would how many uh
 
05:26:50.570 --> 05:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
and you can vote twice here uh how many
 
05:26:53.868 --> 05:26:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:55.850 --> 05:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
I can do Tuesday that's pretty much
 
05:26:58.430 --> 05:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
everybody except couple how many would
 
05:27:01.070 --> 05:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
like Wednesday
 
05:27:04.430 --> 05:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
looks like Tuesday has it
 
05:27:04.440 --> 05:27:07.910 align:start position:0%
looks like Tuesday has it
sorry

05:27:07.910 --> 05:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:10.730 --> 05:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
now as I said I put my watch away and
 
05:27:13.368 --> 05:27:13.378 align:start position:0%
instead I have a calendar
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
and that was a laugh line and if I hold
 
05:27:19.430 --> 05:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
up the cards on one side and the cards
 
05:27:22.250 --> 05:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
on another side 10 minutes equals 10
 
05:27:25.610 --> 05:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
hours I did the math so we're going into
 
05:27:29.448 --> 05:27:29.458 align:start position:0%
a two minute rule we do that so those of
 
05:27:31.250 --> 05:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
you who have been patiently waiting and
 
05:27:33.530 --> 05:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
will be long patiently waiting will not
 
05:27:36.230 --> 05:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
be here at 10 o'clock tonight or you'll
 
05:27:37.670 --> 05:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
have invested a whole day and you never
 
05:27:39.350 --> 05:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
testified because you had to go home at
 
05:27:44.470 --> 05:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
nine so I'm asking my vice chair who has
 
05:27:47.810 --> 05:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
abilities on his phone to do countdowns
 
05:27:50.868 --> 05:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
and at a minute 45 he can wave something
 
05:27:54.230 --> 05:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
or say a minute 45 to let you know it is
 
05:27:57.050 --> 05:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
time to wrap it up and you're not going
 
05:27:59.690 --> 05:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
to be punished by me shutting off your
 
05:28:03.708 --> 05:28:03.718 align:start position:0%
mic go to but I will do that if you go
 
05:28:06.590 --> 05:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
much longer so with that in mind I'm
 
05:28:09.770 --> 05:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
going to take people from Bo Stacks call
 
05:28:12.230 --> 05:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
two names and so if somebody's in the
 
05:28:14.090 --> 05:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
other room you've got a few minutes
 
05:28:17.930 --> 05:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
actually two to walk down here first up
 
05:28:17.940 --> 05:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
actually two to walk down here first up
is

05:28:18.640 --> 05:28:18.650 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:28:18.650 --> 05:28:21.430 align:start position:0%
is

if she's in the other room she can
 
05:28:42.350 --> 05:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
wander down
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:48.650 --> 05:28:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:28:51.230 --> 05:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I will be
 
05:28:53.090 --> 05:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
amending the testimony that I had
 
05:28:55.190 --> 05:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
planned today for the interests of
 
05:28:57.470 --> 05:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
parsimony a little bit about my
 
05:29:00.050 --> 05:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
background I have a law degree and
 
05:29:01.610 --> 05:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
worked for the Massachusetts Attorney
 
05:29:03.708 --> 05:29:03.718 align:start position:0%
General's office in the Civil Rights
 
05:29:06.410 --> 05:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
Division I also hold a PhD in health
 
05:29:08.270 --> 05:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
promotion and was a tenured faculty
 
05:29:10.368 --> 05:29:10.378 align:start position:0%
member at Flinders University in South
 
05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
Australia and it published over two
 
05:29:14.330 --> 05:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
dozen peer-reviewed articles in the
 
05:29:16.490 --> 05:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
areas of human sexuality and health
 
05:29:16.500 --> 05:29:17.750 align:start position:0%
areas of human sexuality and health
promotion

05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
promotion
 
05:29:20.510 --> 05:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
I come today to give you a brief tour of
 
05:29:22.610 --> 05:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
the academic literature in the areas of
 
05:29:25.430 --> 05:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
lgbtq mental health a little bit more
 
05:29:28.250 --> 05:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
brief than what I had initially planned
 
05:29:30.948 --> 05:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
the academic literature is unequivocal
 
05:29:33.470 --> 05:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
according to data from the U.S Surgeon
 
05:29:37.368 --> 05:29:37.378 align:start position:0%
General as a whole lgbtq youth are six
 
05:29:40.550 --> 05:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
times more likely to commit suicide as
 
05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
are their straight peers and some
 
05:29:44.868 --> 05:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
estimates put that as 20 times more
 
05:29:47.570 --> 05:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
likely that statistic remains true when
 
05:29:49.750 --> 05:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
we control for factors like race
 
05:29:51.650 --> 05:29:51.660 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic status and other
 
05:29:54.288 --> 05:29:54.298 align:start position:0%
potentially confounding variables
 
05:29:57.288 --> 05:29:57.298 align:start position:0%
why is it that lgbtq youth are
 
05:29:59.150 --> 05:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
substantially more likely to commit
 
05:30:01.368 --> 05:30:01.378 align:start position:0%
suicide it's that we live in a culture
 
05:30:04.270 --> 05:30:04.280 align:start position:0%
that is tremendously hostile towards
 
05:30:06.470 --> 05:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
lgbtq people
 
05:30:08.090 --> 05:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
you don't need to look any further than
 
05:30:10.368 --> 05:30:10.378 align:start position:0%
the Nightly News to confirm that fact
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative if you have about a
 
05:30:13.788 --> 05:30:13.798 align:start position:0%
minute so steer it back into the bill
 
05:30:13.798 --> 05:30:15.288 align:start position:0%
minute so steer it back into the bill
please

05:30:15.288 --> 05:30:15.298 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:30:17.990 --> 05:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately lgbtq youth oftentimes
 
05:30:19.970 --> 05:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
have a negative experience coming out
 
05:30:22.550 --> 05:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
the title of a 2016 academic article
 
05:30:25.310 --> 05:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
aptly sums it up family support would
 
05:30:28.550 --> 05:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
have been like amazing indeed recent
 
05:30:30.590 --> 05:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
academic research demonstrates that the
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
median experience of coming out to
 
05:30:37.430 --> 05:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
family is negative or hostile but
 
05:30:39.470 --> 05:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
I know that sometimes as a legislator
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
hearing research Falls in deaf ears so
 
05:30:44.868 --> 05:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
listen to my experience of working on
 
05:30:48.050 --> 05:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
the Trevor Project which is an lgbtq
 
05:30:50.030 --> 05:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
suicide hotline
 
05:30:53.448 --> 05:30:53.458 align:start position:0%
a youth called in with gun in hand after
 
05:30:55.490 --> 05:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
he had been outed to his mother against
 
05:30:59.810 --> 05:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:01.310 --> 05:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
this youth
 
05:31:03.890 --> 05:31:03.900 align:start position:0%
said that his mother told him that she
 
05:31:06.110 --> 05:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
no longer loved him that he was an
 
05:31:08.510 --> 05:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
Abomination before God
 
05:31:11.868 --> 05:31:11.878 align:start position:0%
and that she wanted him out of the house
 
05:31:13.910 --> 05:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
I spoke to him for over an hour and we
 
05:31:15.350 --> 05:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
talked about ways to deal with stress
 
05:31:16.550 --> 05:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
and how we could talk to his mother
 
05:31:16.560 --> 05:31:17.930 align:start position:0%
and how we could talk to his mother
again

05:31:17.930 --> 05:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:31:21.230 --> 05:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
and then the chat went silent
 
05:31:23.330 --> 05:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
I tried to contact him to see if he was
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
there but
 
05:31:26.208 --> 05:31:26.218 align:start position:0%
he wasn't
 
05:31:28.490 --> 05:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know what happened to him and
 
05:31:30.830 --> 05:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps I never will
 
05:31:33.650 --> 05:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
how many chats like that will it take
 
05:31:35.570 --> 05:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
for you to find this bill in expedient
 
05:31:49.190 --> 05:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:51.470 --> 05:31:51.480 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire I'm a retired teacher

um and uh I'll be short I had just a
 
05:32:28.730 --> 05:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
couple things I wanted to say about this
 
05:32:32.030 --> 05:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
um if I was morally faced with a
 
05:32:34.368 --> 05:32:34.378 align:start position:0%
situation where I was talking to
 
05:32:34.378 --> 05:32:35.750 align:start position:0%
situation where I was talking to
somebody

05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:32:38.330 --> 05:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
who who and they were they wanted to
 
05:32:40.310 --> 05:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
they were telling me about their
 
05:32:42.948 --> 05:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
pronouns for instance and I knew that I
 
05:32:45.770 --> 05:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
had to report them to their parents for
 
05:32:49.010 --> 05:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
that and at the same time they were also
 
05:32:50.150 --> 05:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
telling me
 
05:32:52.788 --> 05:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
don't tell my parents they'll kill me
 
05:32:55.190 --> 05:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
you know which is how they kid would
 
05:32:56.990 --> 05:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
speak maybe they literally would kill
 
05:32:58.490 --> 05:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
them but
 
05:32:58.500 --> 05:32:59.150 align:start position:0%
them but
um

05:32:59.150 --> 05:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:01.010 --> 05:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
you you're saying you're putting me in
 
05:33:03.288 --> 05:33:03.298 align:start position:0%
the situation where I would have to
 
05:33:05.868 --> 05:33:05.878 align:start position:0%
report that knowing that they would be
 
05:33:09.770 --> 05:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
harmed and I find that morally
 
05:33:11.810 --> 05:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
um reprehensible that I would be put in
 
05:33:14.270 --> 05:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
the position of putting someone in the
 
05:33:17.690 --> 05:33:17.700 align:start position:0%
way of harm that's my objection to this
 
05:33:17.700 --> 05:33:19.190 align:start position:0%
way of harm that's my objection to this
bill

05:33:19.190 --> 05:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:33:19.200 --> 05:33:20.990 align:start position:0%
bill
and

05:33:20.990 --> 05:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:21.000 --> 05:33:21.590 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:33:21.590 --> 05:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:24.050 --> 05:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
I but if you had to have a bill like
 
05:33:26.390 --> 05:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
this I did find an area that you could
 
05:33:26.400 --> 05:33:27.830 align:start position:0%
this I did find an area that you could
fix

05:33:27.830 --> 05:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
fix
 
05:33:29.868 --> 05:33:29.878 align:start position:0%
and that is that you've left out the
 
05:33:32.150 --> 05:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
05:33:32.160 --> 05:33:33.830 align:start position:0%
idea of
uh

05:33:33.830 --> 05:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:33:36.110 --> 05:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
the you mentioned military recruiters
 
05:33:38.930 --> 05:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
but you failed to mention ROTC and in
 
05:33:41.868 --> 05:33:41.878 align:start position:0%
some states kids are put into ROTC
 
05:33:44.270 --> 05:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
without their parents permission that
 
05:33:46.850 --> 05:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
should be included too
 
05:33:49.550 --> 05:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
05:33:52.190 --> 05:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much the chair
 
05:33:54.410 --> 05:33:54.420 align:start position:0%

05:33:57.170 --> 05:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
from Grafton district 18 to come up and
 
05:33:59.090 --> 05:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
in the on Deck Circle flown in at Great
 
05:34:15.470 --> 05:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:16.788 --> 05:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:34:18.948 --> 05:34:18.958 align:start position:0%
committee members for hearing my
 
05:34:18.958 --> 05:34:20.810 align:start position:0%
committee members for hearing my
testimony

05:34:20.810 --> 05:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:34:23.510 --> 05:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
I just want to I as I was sitting here I
 
05:34:24.708 --> 05:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
was just taking notes I don't really
 
05:34:26.868 --> 05:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
have anything prepared to say I just
 
05:34:26.878 --> 05:34:27.770 align:start position:0%
have anything prepared to say I just
wanted

05:34:27.770 --> 05:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
05:34:29.930 --> 05:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
to say a few statements and let you know
 
05:34:31.430 --> 05:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
a few things here
 
05:34:33.410 --> 05:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
one thing I noticed that you know the a
 
05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
child goes to school for about 12 years
 
05:34:37.910 --> 05:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
all right during that time it's about 12
 
05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
960 hours of the child's life
 
05:34:42.350 --> 05:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
six hours a day
 
05:34:45.470 --> 05:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
180 days a year
 
05:34:48.650 --> 05:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
during that same 12 years
 
05:34:50.868 --> 05:34:50.878 align:start position:0%
are at that point they're 18 years old
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
so during that time there they have
 
05:34:57.890 --> 05:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
actually you know lived 50 uh 156 780
 
05:35:01.368 --> 05:35:01.378 align:start position:0%
hours so basically the school has the
 
05:35:03.770 --> 05:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
child for eight point eight point two
 
05:35:06.410 --> 05:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
percent of their life during the entire
 
05:35:07.670 --> 05:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
12 years
 
05:35:10.010 --> 05:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
it comes back that the parental rights
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
here is the parents and then at that at
 
05:35:14.150 --> 05:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
this point here it's
 
05:35:17.150 --> 05:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
the um you know we have to come back and
 
05:35:19.910 --> 05:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
say is it is it the
 
05:35:21.410 --> 05:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to use the word
 
05:35:23.030 --> 05:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
ownership because it's not the right
 
05:35:26.270 --> 05:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
word but does the government does the
 
05:35:28.850 --> 05:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
school own the child
 
05:35:32.510 --> 05:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
or is the child the property and the
 
05:35:34.670 --> 05:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
upbringing of the parents are the
 
05:35:36.650 --> 05:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
parents and I think we're getting things
 
05:35:38.510 --> 05:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
confused there and things are getting
 
05:35:40.430 --> 05:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
backwards and another thing I want to
 
05:35:42.110 --> 05:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
bring up is you know we see we see out
 
05:35:43.190 --> 05:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
there it says
 
05:35:46.250 --> 05:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
you see something say something
 
05:35:48.470 --> 05:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to schools and parents
 
05:35:51.110 --> 05:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
you hear something you don't say
 
05:35:51.120 --> 05:35:52.250 align:start position:0%
you hear something you don't say
anything

05:35:52.250 --> 05:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:35:54.470 --> 05:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense
 
05:35:56.990 --> 05:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
so some of these things we're trying to
 
05:35:59.030 --> 05:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
protect the parents so the parents have
 
05:36:02.510 --> 05:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
that choice of knowing if something's
 
05:36:05.570 --> 05:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
going on with their child and I think
 
05:36:08.270 --> 05:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
that is important that the parent needs
 
05:36:10.670 --> 05:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
the right to know and you need to be
 
05:36:12.230 --> 05:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
protecting the parent not the government
 
05:36:13.970 --> 05:36:13.980 align:start position:0%

05:36:16.550 --> 05:36:16.560 align:start position:0%

vote against hb10 as a Survivor I know
 
05:36:55.788 --> 05:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
the importance of being able to have
 
05:36:57.708 --> 05:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
trusted teachers and faculty at schools
 
05:36:59.330 --> 05:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
while some parents are good and
 
05:37:01.310 --> 05:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
trustworthy I know firsthand the damage

caregivers each year
 
05:37:20.930 --> 05:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
growing up in my household we hit a
 
05:37:22.730 --> 05:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
secret one that included holes in the
 
05:37:24.770 --> 05:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
walls bruises constant yelling and
 
05:37:27.050 --> 05:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
threats my biological thought that we
 
05:37:28.850 --> 05:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
were his property that he could own
 
05:37:31.070 --> 05:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
everything about us and what we did we
 
05:37:32.690 --> 05:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
were told what happened at home was
 
05:37:35.030 --> 05:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
family business then one day he was
 
05:37:37.730 --> 05:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
taken out of our house as we started to
 
05:37:39.170 --> 05:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
figure out that this wasn't how
 
05:37:41.330 --> 05:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
everybody lived we became more scared of
 
05:37:43.190 --> 05:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
my dad and what he might do
 
05:37:45.470 --> 05:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
my mom had me and my siblings pick a
 
05:37:47.030 --> 05:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
teacher that we trusted at school that I
 
05:37:49.070 --> 05:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
could talk that we could talk to I
 
05:37:50.448 --> 05:37:50.458 align:start position:0%
picked the school counselor and my
 
05:37:51.830 --> 05:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
fourth grade teacher
 
05:37:54.530 --> 05:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
and as having hard and scary days I knew
 
05:37:56.390 --> 05:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
I could talk to them some things I
 
05:37:57.890 --> 05:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
didn't care if my mom knew about and
 
05:37:59.810 --> 05:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
other things I wasn't ready to talk to
 
05:38:00.948 --> 05:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
her about
 
05:38:02.990 --> 05:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
I was confused and working through a lot
 
05:38:04.970 --> 05:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
of emotions at home there was still a
 
05:38:06.590 --> 05:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
feeling of being scared about what might
 
05:38:09.410 --> 05:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
happen I didn't want my dad to know
 
05:38:12.470 --> 05:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
any of it he had been very violent and I
 
05:38:13.970 --> 05:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
knew that he would hurt us after
 
05:38:15.410 --> 05:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
knocking out and strangling my brother
 
05:38:17.390 --> 05:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
while he was in our house my dad told us
 
05:38:19.490 --> 05:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
that if we told anyone he would finish
 
05:38:20.750 --> 05:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
the job
 
05:38:23.330 --> 05:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
if a billic HP 10 was in place at that
 
05:38:25.490 --> 05:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
time I can't imagine I would be able to
 
05:38:27.948 --> 05:38:27.958 align:start position:0%
be sitting here today to testify
 
05:38:30.170 --> 05:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
my mom has always made sure that we know
 
05:38:32.330 --> 05:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
that this journey in our in survival is
 
05:38:34.128 --> 05:38:34.138 align:start position:0%
our own that we get to make choices on
 
05:38:36.288 --> 05:38:36.298 align:start position:0%
how we deal with this she also empowers
 
05:38:37.850 --> 05:38:37.860 align:start position:0%
us to ask teachers and get different
 
05:38:40.010 --> 05:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
perspectives between even because even
 
05:38:42.230 --> 05:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
adults can make mistakes
 
05:38:44.270 --> 05:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
sorry teachers and counselors are
 
05:38:45.770 --> 05:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
required to go to school and get degrees
 
05:38:48.470 --> 05:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
to teach and advise kids but anyone can
 
05:38:50.570 --> 05:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
be a parent with no degree or classes
 
05:38:50.580 --> 05:38:51.830 align:start position:0%
be a parent with no degree or classes
required

05:38:51.830 --> 05:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
required
 
05:38:53.810 --> 05:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
without the ability to be able to talk
 
05:38:55.490 --> 05:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
through some very confusing times with
 
05:38:56.990 --> 05:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
my teacher and knowing that I was
 
05:38:58.970 --> 05:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
protected my journey in surviving would
 
05:39:00.770 --> 05:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
not would be very different and not as
 
05:39:00.780 --> 05:39:01.730 align:start position:0%
not would be very different and not as
successful

05:39:01.730 --> 05:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
successful
 
05:39:03.590 --> 05:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
I have many friends who have trusted
 
05:39:05.208 --> 05:39:05.218 align:start position:0%
conversations with teachers because they
 
05:39:07.310 --> 05:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
are scared of their parents we need to
 
05:39:09.530 --> 05:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
empower we need to we need to be
 
05:39:11.030 --> 05:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
empowered to figure things out without
 
05:39:14.150 --> 05:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
retribution from a retribution from
 
05:39:16.610 --> 05:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
abusive and violent parents even though
 
05:39:18.590 --> 05:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
not every house was like mine many are
 
05:39:20.628 --> 05:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
and you can't tell the difference on
 
05:39:22.490 --> 05:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
behalf of my friends and other students
 
05:39:24.708 --> 05:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
I ask you to understand the damage a
 
05:39:26.270 --> 05:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
bill like this can do please vote
 
05:39:33.230 --> 05:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:35.628 --> 05:39:35.638 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes Aubrey Friedman
 
05:39:38.990 --> 05:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
with Brian Harlow as Brian Harlow around
 
05:39:41.868 --> 05:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
for the on Deck Circle
 
05:39:43.690 --> 05:39:43.700 align:start position:0%
um anyway go ahead
 
05:39:46.550 --> 05:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
Aubrey Friedman Bridgewater I speak in
 
05:39:49.128 --> 05:39:49.138 align:start position:0%
support of this bill uh there's a few
 
05:39:51.830 --> 05:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
things I don't like about it but it's
 
05:39:53.390 --> 05:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
definitely a step in the right direction
 
05:39:56.208 --> 05:39:56.218 align:start position:0%
I think it doesn't the thing that people
 
05:39:59.448 --> 05:39:59.458 align:start position:0%
freak out about is this a changing
 
05:40:02.090 --> 05:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
excuse me changing the names and the
 
05:40:05.150 --> 05:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
pronoun thing at school the thing I
 
05:40:07.128 --> 05:40:07.138 align:start position:0%
think more people these days are
 
05:40:10.010 --> 05:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
accepting of if you're gay or I know
 
05:40:11.628 --> 05:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
people will dispute that but I think
 
05:40:14.030 --> 05:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's more accepted these days gay
 
05:40:17.030 --> 05:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
bisexual whatever but if the kid goes to
 
05:40:19.368 --> 05:40:19.378 align:start position:0%
school and they want to change their
 
05:40:21.708 --> 05:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
pronouns and do all that stuff that's
 
05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
where people freak out and that to me
 
05:40:26.330 --> 05:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
goes beyond the line and that's where
 
05:40:29.750 --> 05:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
parents have to know so people also say
 
05:40:34.310 --> 05:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
well you're this will force people to uh
 
05:40:37.310 --> 05:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
teachers to out the kids that's not true
 
05:40:40.368 --> 05:40:40.378 align:start position:0%
if a kid confides to a teacher or a
 
05:40:42.410 --> 05:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
counselor or whoever at school people
 
05:40:44.990 --> 05:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
that they're gay or bisexual or
 
05:40:47.628 --> 05:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
transgender I don't see anything in this
 
05:40:52.128 --> 05:40:52.138 align:start position:0%
bill that requires the teacher to tell
 
05:40:53.410 --> 05:40:53.420 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
05:40:55.730 --> 05:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
and they really shouldn't you know it's
 
05:40:58.070 --> 05:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
a confidential thing but if they go over
 
05:40:59.570 --> 05:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
the line they go no we're going to
 
05:41:02.448 --> 05:41:02.458 align:start position:0%
change I'm now a different gender and
 
05:41:04.250 --> 05:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
you've got to have a different name that
 
05:41:06.410 --> 05:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
goes over the line that's crazy as far
 
05:41:09.110 --> 05:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
as I'm concerned and this bill I know in
 
05:41:12.288 --> 05:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
sau4 we have pushed the administration
 
05:41:16.070 --> 05:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
on this and they say the policy is that
 
05:41:18.948 --> 05:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
we will encourage the kids to tell their
 
05:41:21.288 --> 05:41:21.298 align:start position:0%
parents but we will not tell the parents
 
05:41:22.730 --> 05:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
themselves and we're talking about
 
05:41:24.830 --> 05:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
changing the name and the pronoun and
 
05:41:27.770 --> 05:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
all that stuff at school that's crazy so
 
05:41:30.530 --> 05:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
I think that parents need to be informed
 
05:41:33.410 --> 05:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
of that but there's no reason nothing in
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
this bill that would force a teacher to
 
05:41:39.430 --> 05:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
being like an informant or uh
 
05:41:42.110 --> 05:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
you know to uh
 
05:41:45.288 --> 05:41:45.298 align:start position:0%
you know inform on the kids so I think
 
05:41:47.570 --> 05:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of emotionalism there and
 
05:41:50.110 --> 05:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
it's just not in the bill that I can see
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
and also thank you very much you have
 
05:41:54.948 --> 05:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
hit the two minute mark

05:42:14.930 --> 05:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman in the committee thank you
 
05:42:18.410 --> 05:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
for providing me with this opportunity
 
05:42:21.770 --> 05:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
um the sponsors of HP 10 wonder why the
 
05:42:25.970 --> 05:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
lgbtq community seems concerned
 
05:42:27.530 --> 05:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to say children are well
 
05:42:29.628 --> 05:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
aware if they're loved at home
 
05:42:31.490 --> 05:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
children are also inherently aware if
 
05:42:33.170 --> 05:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
their home is safe
 
05:42:36.288 --> 05:42:36.298 align:start position:0%
safe is in safe to divulge I'm queer gay
 
05:42:40.368 --> 05:42:40.378 align:start position:0%
trans bi non-binary what have you
 
05:42:43.250 --> 05:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
safe as in safe for Mom to know
 
05:42:45.890 --> 05:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
Dad Grandma Uncle what have you
 
05:42:47.750 --> 05:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
is abusing me
 
05:42:50.868 --> 05:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
and will take action to protect me
 
05:42:52.910 --> 05:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
or dad to know I'm being abused by my
 
05:42:55.610 --> 05:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
other dad whatever it may be
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
this bill will put some kids at risk all
 
05:42:58.080 --> 05:42:59.090 align:start position:0%
this bill will put some kids at risk all
kids

05:42:59.090 --> 05:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
kids
 
05:43:01.368 --> 05:43:01.378 align:start position:0%
no of course not but I guarantee more
 
05:43:03.230 --> 05:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
than we can imagine
 
05:43:05.628 --> 05:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
mark my words not all priest abuse not
 
05:43:07.910 --> 05:43:07.920 align:start position:0%

at all abuse
 
05:43:12.110 --> 05:43:12.120 align:start position:0%

here in support of hb10 as filed
 
05:44:53.810 --> 05:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
I think everybody in this room
 
05:44:55.730 --> 05:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
shares the view that children are
 
05:44:57.830 --> 05:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
important and we should do whatever we
 
05:45:00.770 --> 05:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
can within our power to protect them
 
05:45:03.230 --> 05:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
that's clear how we may go about it
 
05:45:05.448 --> 05:45:05.458 align:start position:0%
might differ but we all have a common
 
05:45:08.570 --> 05:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
goal to make sure children
 
05:45:10.850 --> 05:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
in typically in their home environment
 
05:45:12.770 --> 05:45:12.780 align:start position:0%

05:45:28.010 --> 05:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
um we also know
 
05:45:31.490 --> 05:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
that not every family is perfect I wish
 
05:45:34.310 --> 05:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
I wish that was the case you can get you
 
05:45:35.930 --> 05:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
need a license to drive a car but not be
 
05:45:37.730 --> 05:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
a dad
 
05:45:37.740 --> 05:45:38.448 align:start position:0%
a dad
um

05:45:38.448 --> 05:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:40.490 --> 05:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
not that I'm arguing for licenses for
 
05:45:42.470 --> 05:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
either but my point there is right there
 
05:45:45.170 --> 05:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
it's easier to be a parent some in some
 
05:45:48.650 --> 05:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:50.750 --> 05:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
um to learn how to drive something as
 
05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
simple as a car that most adults do
 
05:45:55.128 --> 05:45:55.138 align:start position:0%
I also want everybody to realize that
 
05:45:56.570 --> 05:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
when the state gets involved with a
 
05:45:56.580 --> 05:45:57.948 align:start position:0%
when the state gets involved with a
family

05:45:57.948 --> 05:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
family
 
05:45:57.958 --> 05:45:59.208 align:start position:0%
family
okay

05:45:59.208 --> 05:45:59.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:46:01.368 --> 05:46:01.378 align:start position:0%
no matter what their goal is there will
 
05:46:04.190 --> 05:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
be harm that happens the goal when the
 
05:46:06.230 --> 05:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
state gets involved is to minimize the
 
05:46:08.330 --> 05:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
harm to the child meaning the state's
 
05:46:10.970 --> 05:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
involvement and the harm that comes from
 
05:46:12.708 --> 05:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
that is less than the harm that the
 
05:46:14.330 --> 05:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
child is experiencing at that present
 
05:46:14.340 --> 05:46:16.010 align:start position:0%
child is experiencing at that present
time

05:46:16.010 --> 05:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:46:17.990 --> 05:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the ideal world that would be a
 
05:46:19.010 --> 05:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of the time and
 
05:46:21.890 --> 05:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sometimes that isn't the
 
05:46:21.900 --> 05:46:22.670 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sometimes that isn't the
case

05:46:22.670 --> 05:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
case
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
I think putting a bill forward to make
 
05:46:28.310 --> 05:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
it clear relative to the best interest
 
05:46:30.410 --> 05:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
of the child thank you
 
05:46:30.420 --> 05:46:31.070 align:start position:0%
of the child thank you
um

05:46:31.070 --> 05:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:33.470 --> 05:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
that when the state gets involved their
 
05:46:35.868 --> 05:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
goal should be to support the child
 
05:46:38.570 --> 05:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
at the best interest and sometimes that
 
05:46:40.010 --> 05:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
means not getting involved with that
 
05:46:41.810 --> 05:46:41.820 align:start position:0%
I'll close my testimony and ask that you
 
05:46:44.090 --> 05:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
passed this as filed thank you
 
05:46:48.410 --> 05:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:51.350 --> 05:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes early Perez and in

from the New Hampshire youth movement
 
05:47:16.250 --> 05:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
got it thank you good afternoon members
 
05:47:17.510 --> 05:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
05:47:19.850 --> 05:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
I am from Manchester and today I will be
 
05:47:22.670 --> 05:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition to hb10 my
 
05:47:24.170 --> 05:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
biggest issue with the bill is the
 
05:47:26.390 --> 05:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
punishment put in place for teachers
 
05:47:29.288 --> 05:47:29.298 align:start position:0%
for a first-time offense credentials
 
05:47:32.030 --> 05:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
for a first-time offense credentials are
 
05:47:34.368 --> 05:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
to be suspended for a year do we really
 
05:47:36.350 --> 05:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
think that a bill that is written to be
 
05:47:38.208 --> 05:47:38.218 align:start position:0%
so vague that this is a practical
 
05:47:41.030 --> 05:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
repercussion we are trying to get more
 
05:47:43.070 --> 05:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
teachers to quit at a time when we need
 
05:47:44.570 --> 05:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
teachers the most
 
05:47:46.850 --> 05:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
teachers are often part of a safe space
 
05:47:49.430 --> 05:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
for students this bill would find any
 
05:47:51.948 --> 05:47:51.958 align:start position:0%
teacher who encourages or courses or
 
05:47:54.470 --> 05:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
attempts to encourage or coerce a minor
 
05:47:56.448 --> 05:47:56.458 align:start position:0%
trial to withhold information from his
 
05:47:59.090 --> 05:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
or her parent as breaking the law I
 
05:48:00.830 --> 05:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that Educators would be
 
05:48:02.868 --> 05:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
purposefully encourage any student to
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
withhold information from a parent but
 
05:48:07.430 --> 05:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
what if the parent isn't providing a
 
05:48:09.110 --> 05:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
safe space for their child
 
05:48:10.970 --> 05:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
I come from a Catholic household myself
 
05:48:13.670 --> 05:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
my mom despite being generally accepted
 
05:48:15.590 --> 05:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
of other people always made comments
 
05:48:17.090 --> 05:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
about how she would never want me to be
 
05:48:19.730 --> 05:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
gay I was out as a bisexual at school
 
05:48:22.128 --> 05:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
and some teachers were aware of that had
 
05:48:23.868 --> 05:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
I been out at home at that age it would
 
05:48:25.128 --> 05:48:25.138 align:start position:0%
have put me in an uncomfortable
 
05:48:27.530 --> 05:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
situation with my parents I wasn't ready
 
05:48:29.330 --> 05:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
to have that hard conversation yet
 
05:48:30.890 --> 05:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
because I didn't know what the outcome
 
05:48:33.288 --> 05:48:33.298 align:start position:0%
of that conversation would be would I be
 
05:48:35.510 --> 05:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
accepted or put down would my housing be
 
05:48:37.490 --> 05:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
at risk these are hard questions but
 
05:48:40.070 --> 05:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
they're even harder at 17 even now at 24
 
05:48:41.990 --> 05:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
I can't get myself to tell my family
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
that I'm non-binary because I'm scared
 
05:48:45.708 --> 05:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
of how damaging that information could
 
05:48:47.448 --> 05:48:47.458 align:start position:0%
be to our relationship
 
05:48:49.610 --> 05:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
this bill also mentions a guarantee for
 
05:48:51.350 --> 05:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
a parent to opt his or her minor child
 
05:48:52.670 --> 05:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
out of any portion of the school
 
05:48:54.530 --> 05:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
district's health education program that
 
05:48:57.110 --> 05:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
relates to sex education instruction and
 
05:48:59.030 --> 05:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
acquired immunity immune deficiency
 
05:49:01.250 --> 05:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
syndrome education you have 15 seconds
 
05:49:02.810 --> 05:49:02.820 align:start position:0%
to finish institution regarding
 
05:49:05.570 --> 05:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
sexuality my question is why why would
 
05:49:07.070 --> 05:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
we take away a student's decision to
 
05:49:08.628 --> 05:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
learn about those things in an
 
05:49:10.310 --> 05:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
educational setting where they can ask
 
05:49:11.990 --> 05:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
questions and be prepared to make good
 
05:49:14.208 --> 05:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
decisions about their health thank you
 
05:49:16.010 --> 05:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and would you please

and next up is I I read it as Darrell

05:49:37.430 --> 05:49:37.440 align:start position:0%

05:49:41.390 --> 05:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:49:43.610 --> 05:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
hi I'm here to testify in opposition to
 
05:49:46.190 --> 05:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
hb10 as a child my parents made it their
 
05:49:48.170 --> 05:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
goal to opt me out of every form of sex
 
05:49:50.390 --> 05:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
education that was an abstinence only
 
05:49:52.310 --> 05:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
and they made their goal to convince me
 
05:49:54.650 --> 05:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
to be as homophobic and transphobic as
 
05:49:56.570 --> 05:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
possible I'd like to summarize for you
 
05:49:58.670 --> 05:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
the impact that this did and did not
 
05:50:00.048 --> 05:50:00.058 align:start position:0%
have in my life
 
05:50:01.910 --> 05:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
it didn't prevent me from realizing I'm
 
05:50:03.890 --> 05:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
trans it didn't prevent me from learning
 
05:50:05.448 --> 05:50:05.458 align:start position:0%
about sexual sexuality and it didn't
 
05:50:06.830 --> 05:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
stop me from falling in love with a
 
05:50:08.510 --> 05:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
trans person
 
05:50:11.150 --> 05:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
who's now my life partner
 
05:50:12.470 --> 05:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
here's what it did do though it caused
 
05:50:14.270 --> 05:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
me to lose years of Friendship with my
 
05:50:15.530 --> 05:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
high school best friend who came out
 
05:50:18.170 --> 05:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
before I had moved away from the harmful
 
05:50:20.448 --> 05:50:20.458 align:start position:0%
beliefs that my parents gave me caused
 
05:50:21.948 --> 05:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
me to seek out sexual information from
 
05:50:24.530 --> 05:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
unreliable and dangerous sources and it
 
05:50:26.030 --> 05:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
stunted my knowledge of basic Sexual
 
05:50:27.590 --> 05:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
Health in such a way that my intimacy
 
05:50:29.750 --> 05:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
and Trust in marriage was and in smaller
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
ways continues to be harmed when I think
 
05:50:32.990 --> 05:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
about the lives of my high school
 
05:50:34.548 --> 05:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
friends with the same experience many of
 
05:50:36.530 --> 05:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
them CIS straight kids this last Point
 
05:50:38.270 --> 05:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
sticks out I know so many people who
 
05:50:39.708 --> 05:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
when they got married they experienced
 
05:50:41.448 --> 05:50:41.458 align:start position:0%
pain and suffering because they were not
 
05:50:43.128 --> 05:50:43.138 align:start position:0%
given education and rather made to feel
 
05:50:45.110 --> 05:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
ashamed of their bodies my life
 
05:50:46.670 --> 05:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
experience has shown me that it is
 
05:50:49.250 --> 05:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
impossible to stigmatize and shame queer
 
05:50:52.010 --> 05:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
sexuality without also stigmatizing and
 
05:50:54.288 --> 05:50:54.298 align:start position:0%
shaming the monogamous sexuality that
 
05:50:55.548 --> 05:50:55.558 align:start position:0%
the writers of this bill would hold up
 
05:50:57.230 --> 05:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
is morally correct
 
05:50:59.030 --> 05:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
the right that this bill upholds is not
 
05:51:00.410 --> 05:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
the parental right to keep their child
 
05:51:02.448 --> 05:51:02.458 align:start position:0%
from learning information I don't know
 
05:51:04.430 --> 05:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
that that's even possible rather it's
 
05:51:05.868 --> 05:51:05.878 align:start position:0%
the right of a parent to harm their
 
05:51:07.368 --> 05:51:07.378 align:start position:0%
child's ability to form intimate and
 
05:51:09.530 --> 05:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
loving relationships and friendships to
 
05:51:11.270 --> 05:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
grow into a healthy and well-connected
 
05:51:13.310 --> 05:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
adult I hope after you hear this that
 
05:51:15.110 --> 05:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
you can understand that this bill uses
 
05:51:17.090 --> 05:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
the language of protecting children but
 
05:51:18.770 --> 05:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
it provides the legal framework for
 
05:51:20.990 --> 05:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
parents to do great harm please vote in
 
05:51:23.390 --> 05:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
opposition I'd also like to add that our
 
05:51:27.288 --> 05:51:27.298 align:start position:0%
law only provides to protect kids after
 
05:51:31.070 --> 05:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
they have been abused kids know their
 
05:51:33.470 --> 05:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
parents will abuse them if they come out
 
05:51:36.110 --> 05:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
and the law provides no protection for
 
05:51:38.448 --> 05:51:38.458 align:start position:0%
theoretical abuse and this makes it
 
05:51:41.390 --> 05:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
easier for that abuse to happen
 
05:51:45.470 --> 05:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:47.390 --> 05:51:47.400 align:start position:0%

05:52:16.970 --> 05:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:52:18.708 --> 05:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
um I agree that it is a fundamental
 
05:52:20.208 --> 05:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
right of parents to direct the
 
05:52:21.890 --> 05:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
upbringing in Education and Care of
 
05:52:23.448 --> 05:52:23.458 align:start position:0%
their minor children
 
05:52:25.788 --> 05:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
important information relating to a
 
05:52:27.590 --> 05:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
minor should not be withheld from his or
 
05:52:28.670 --> 05:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
her parent including information
 
05:52:31.368 --> 05:52:31.378 align:start position:0%
relating to the miners child's health
 
05:52:33.948 --> 05:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
well-being education and education while
 
05:52:35.930 --> 05:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
the minor is in the custody of the
 
05:52:37.190 --> 05:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
school district
 
05:52:39.708 --> 05:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
parents have a fundal fundamental and
 
05:52:41.930 --> 05:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
inalienable right to be the influencers
 
05:52:44.810 --> 05:52:44.820 align:start position:0%
and Moral Moral Compass of their family
 
05:52:46.690 --> 05:52:46.700 align:start position:0%
and their children
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
this begs the question that's being
 
05:52:51.830 --> 05:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
asked why why is a parent's
 
05:52:54.530 --> 05:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
Rights bill necessary and the answer is
 
05:52:56.628 --> 05:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
that the school have overstepped their
 
05:52:58.430 --> 05:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
boundaries in all these areas and are
 
05:53:00.288 --> 05:53:00.298 align:start position:0%
usurping the fundamental rights of
 
05:53:03.770 --> 05:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
parents as the gentleman had said before
 
05:53:05.510 --> 05:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the in the beginning of this meeting
 
05:53:07.070 --> 05:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
that there is an attitude that our
 
05:53:08.750 --> 05:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
children should be educated differently
 
05:53:10.610 --> 05:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
from how they've been educated in the
 
05:53:13.368 --> 05:53:13.378 align:start position:0%
past and that parents are abusive
 
05:53:16.510 --> 05:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of information of a sexually
 
05:53:19.250 --> 05:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
explicit nature being provided in the
 
05:53:21.890 --> 05:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
schools is overwhelming over 90 sexually
 
05:53:23.930 --> 05:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
explicit books in our school libraries
 
05:53:26.628 --> 05:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
and on Sora why are we hypersexualizing
 
05:53:29.150 --> 05:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
our children to begin with the American
 
05:53:32.030 --> 05:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
School counseling Association has
 
05:53:34.128 --> 05:53:34.138 align:start position:0%
encouraged their trainees to lie
 
05:53:36.230 --> 05:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
undermine and withhold information from
 
05:53:38.448 --> 05:53:38.458 align:start position:0%
parents this does not make schools a
 
05:53:40.610 --> 05:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
safe place if this is where the training
 
05:53:42.770 --> 05:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
is coming from in their training program
 
05:53:45.590 --> 05:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
titled No Limits there is video of this
 
05:53:47.990 --> 05:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
lead leadership detailing this
 
05:53:50.208 --> 05:53:50.218 align:start position:0%
undermining in their own words this is
 
05:53:51.650 --> 05:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
discoverable you can find it on
 
05:53:55.368 --> 05:53:55.378 align:start position:0%
Courageous habit.org by Alvin Louie
 
05:53:57.350 --> 05:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
um and in addition there are surveys
 
05:53:59.270 --> 05:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
designed to be self-fulfilling
 
05:54:00.948 --> 05:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
prophecies in there through the data
 
05:54:03.770 --> 05:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
mining of the surveys that we have
 
05:54:06.590 --> 05:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative ball that
 
05:54:09.170 --> 05:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
connecting the parents with counseling
 
05:54:11.170 --> 05:54:11.180 align:start position:0%
is one of the best things you can do
 
05:54:13.430 --> 05:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
include the parents in the conversation
 
05:54:15.530 --> 05:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
and this will then build trust where
 
05:54:17.628 --> 05:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
there currently is none thank you for
 
05:54:20.150 --> 05:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
05:54:23.810 --> 05:54:23.820 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Cameron munz with
 
05:54:26.208 --> 05:54:26.218 align:start position:0%
representative Christine Perez in the on
 
05:54:29.868 --> 05:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:32.750 --> 05:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
so just to give you some context I was a
 
05:54:34.788 --> 05:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
public educator in Nashua for 11 years
 
05:54:38.750 --> 05:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
before I chose to resign because of
 
05:54:40.690 --> 05:54:40.700 align:start position:0%
well because of why I'm here today
 
05:54:42.708 --> 05:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
second of all I just want to comment
 
05:54:44.770 --> 05:54:44.780 align:start position:0%
that if you want to
 
05:54:47.510 --> 05:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
make a claim on over sexualizing
 
05:54:50.090 --> 05:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
children then I would like to see you at
 
05:54:53.030 --> 05:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
Target in front of the baby section
 
05:54:57.890 --> 05:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
um with uh you know protesting against
 
05:54:57.900 --> 05:54:59.890 align:start position:0%
um with uh you know protesting against
the

05:54:59.890 --> 05:54:59.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:55:04.368 --> 05:55:04.378 align:start position:0%
uh the baby like onesies of like
 
05:55:07.368 --> 05:55:07.378 align:start position:0%
Ladies Man or you know anything like
 
05:55:08.570 --> 05:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
that so if that's what you're actually
 
05:55:11.150 --> 05:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
worried about I'll see you at Target
 
05:55:12.948 --> 05:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
um so I'm in complete opposition of this
 
05:55:15.230 --> 05:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
bill due to its blatant anti-trans
 
05:55:17.510 --> 05:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
government overreach and it would be an
 
05:55:19.970 --> 05:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
offense to anyone in this room to think
 
05:55:22.730 --> 05:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
that it is not anti-trans uh if you
 
05:55:24.590 --> 05:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
notice all the people coming up they're
 
05:55:27.048 --> 05:55:27.058 align:start position:0%
mentioning uh trans rights they're
 
05:55:29.030 --> 05:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
mentioning heaven forbid their child
 
05:55:29.040 --> 05:55:30.470 align:start position:0%
mentioning heaven forbid their child
actually

05:55:30.470 --> 05:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:55:31.850 --> 05:55:31.860 align:start position:0%
um you know uses the English language
 
05:55:35.090 --> 05:55:35.100 align:start position:0%
and and plays with pronouns
 
05:55:37.368 --> 05:55:37.378 align:start position:0%
um I'm also in opposition to it because
 
05:55:41.090 --> 05:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
it it goes in quite contrast to hb619
 
05:55:43.070 --> 05:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
which was heard earlier today which
 
05:55:44.750 --> 05:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
takes the rights of medical decisions
 
05:55:47.090 --> 05:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
away from parents with their trans
 
05:55:49.970 --> 05:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
children and yet in hb10
 
05:55:51.590 --> 05:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
um someone actually sitting just here
 
05:55:53.868 --> 05:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
one of the co-sponsors said parents and
 
05:55:55.250 --> 05:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
not the state are responsible for
 
05:55:57.110 --> 05:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
upbringing of their children so I'm
 
05:56:00.110 --> 05:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
concerned with some obvious
 
05:56:02.110 --> 05:56:02.120 align:start position:0%
um hypocrisy in that
 
05:56:04.368 --> 05:56:04.378 align:start position:0%
hb619 also says that public school
 
05:56:06.410 --> 05:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
schools K through 12 in New Hampshire
 
05:56:08.208 --> 05:56:08.218 align:start position:0%
shall refer to children by the name and
 
05:56:10.990 --> 05:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
gender that they're enrolled as but hb10
 
05:56:14.390 --> 05:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
says that parents have their rights
 
05:56:16.190 --> 05:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
um so that would
 
05:56:18.830 --> 05:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
potentially get rid of the rights of the
 
05:56:21.170 --> 05:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
appearance of trans students so
 
05:56:22.610 --> 05:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
essentially basically everything that
 
05:56:24.048 --> 05:56:24.058 align:start position:0%
I've been listening to today has been
 
05:56:26.208 --> 05:56:26.218 align:start position:0%
contradicting itself in the name of
 
05:56:28.250 --> 05:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
protecting children but really what it
 
05:56:31.190 --> 05:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
is is its anti-trans legislature and
 
05:56:33.048 --> 05:56:33.058 align:start position:0%
someone earlier today said that tools
 
05:56:35.090 --> 05:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
can be uh this is a tool not a weapon
 
05:56:37.310 --> 05:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
but tools can be used as Weapons when
 
05:56:39.890 --> 05:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
wielded to cause harm
 
05:56:42.650 --> 05:56:42.660 align:start position:0%

Christine Perez I am from Londonderry I
 
05:57:15.830 --> 05:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
am a retired nurse I am a mother I'm a
 
05:57:17.330 --> 05:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
grandmother and I'm now a state
 
05:57:20.690 --> 05:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
representative about three years ago
 
05:57:23.930 --> 05:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
um I had a bunch of parents that I was
 
05:57:25.310 --> 05:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
going and speaking at school board
 
05:57:27.948 --> 05:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
meetings with who were having a terrible
 
05:57:31.368 --> 05:57:31.378 align:start position:0%
time getting any response from their
 
05:57:34.490 --> 05:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
school board to find out what was going
 
05:57:36.350 --> 05:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
on with their children to find out what
 
05:57:39.048 --> 05:57:39.058 align:start position:0%
books were in the library what their
 
05:57:42.170 --> 05:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
children what Choose Love was
 
05:57:44.750 --> 05:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
um they were having a horrible time many
 
05:57:46.548 --> 05:57:46.558 align:start position:0%
of these parents withdrew their children
 
05:57:49.970 --> 05:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
from public school based on that last
 
05:57:52.128 --> 05:57:52.138 align:start position:0%
May these parents approached me and
 
05:57:53.868 --> 05:57:53.878 align:start position:0%
asked me to become a state
 
05:57:57.048 --> 05:57:57.058 align:start position:0%
representative never did I think I would
 
05:57:59.510 --> 05:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
I ended up on the Judiciary committed
 
05:58:01.970 --> 05:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
committee and I believe that I was put
 
05:58:03.470 --> 05:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
there for a reason although it wasn't
 
05:58:06.230 --> 05:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
one of my choices
 
05:58:09.650 --> 05:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
um I keep wondering so I decided that I
 
05:58:11.810 --> 05:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
was going to be a rep because one of my
 
05:58:14.150 --> 05:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
main goals was to stand up for parents
 
05:58:17.150 --> 05:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
and children not my only but parents and
 
05:58:19.430 --> 05:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
children and I keep wondering why we're
 
05:58:21.890 --> 05:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
here even discussing this what has
 
05:58:24.410 --> 05:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
happened to our society that we have to
 
05:58:27.110 --> 05:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
have laws protecting parents whether
 
05:58:30.288 --> 05:58:30.298 align:start position:0%
they be biological adoptive custodial or
 
05:58:32.750 --> 05:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
whatever these parents were not having
 
05:58:36.110 --> 05:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
problems with sexual orientation for
 
05:58:38.990 --> 05:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
their children it was much more General
 
05:58:41.810 --> 05:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
things that were going on so this is not
 
05:58:47.708 --> 05:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
just a bill to protect parents of lbgq
 
05:58:52.190 --> 05:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
children on March 1st 2020 through 2023
 
05:58:55.368 --> 05:58:55.378 align:start position:0%
a representative and six co-sponsors
 
05:58:57.230 --> 05:58:57.240 align:start position:0%

Representatives a parental rights
 
05:59:02.330 --> 05:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
amendment to the Constitution the
 
05:59:05.030 --> 05:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
amendment would ensure enshrine that
 
05:59:07.970 --> 05:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
means Preserve in a form that ensures it
 
05:59:10.250 --> 05:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
to be protected and respected the
 
05:59:12.230 --> 05:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
traditional Liberty you have 10 seconds
 
05:59:14.330 --> 05:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
left okay and direct the child's
 
05:59:16.730 --> 05:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
upbringing in education this is common
 
05:59:16.740 --> 05:59:17.810 align:start position:0%
upbringing in education this is common
sense

05:59:17.810 --> 05:59:17.820 align:start position:0%
sense
 
05:59:20.570 --> 05:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
children are not given Advil in schools
 
05:59:22.250 --> 05:59:22.260 align:start position:0%

05:59:25.430 --> 05:59:25.440 align:start position:0%

you're gonna hit the red button first
 
05:59:42.770 --> 05:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you back some of your
 
05:59:44.208 --> 05:59:44.218 align:start position:0%
time because most of what I wanted to
 
05:59:46.730 --> 05:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
say has already been said but uh and in
 
05:59:48.288 --> 05:59:48.298 align:start position:0%
particular the lady that just testified
 
05:59:50.990 --> 05:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
thought about most of it I keep hearing
 
05:59:53.628 --> 05:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
everybody's falling back on the lgbtq
 
05:59:55.850 --> 05:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
issues on this bill we've been hearing
 
05:59:58.190 --> 05:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
all day on this testimony it's not just
 
06:00:00.110 --> 06:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
about that it's about teaching materials
 
06:00:02.628 --> 06:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
it's about books it's about electronic
 
06:00:05.750 --> 06:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
access to books including the Sora app
 
06:00:07.850 --> 06:00:07.860 align:start position:0%
it's about counseling it's about health
 
06:00:10.490 --> 06:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
it's about surveys being taken from the
 
06:00:12.170 --> 06:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
kids it's about bullying it's about
 
06:00:13.910 --> 06:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action
 
06:00:16.788 --> 06:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
why can't parents have I don't even know
 
06:00:18.110 --> 06:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
why we're having this conversation to be
 
06:00:19.430 --> 06:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
honest with you like the lady there just
 
06:00:19.440 --> 06:00:21.310 align:start position:0%
honest with you like the lady there just
said

06:00:21.310 --> 06:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
said
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
it boggles my mind frankly that we have
 
06:00:27.410 --> 06:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
to have a bill that allows parents to be
 
06:00:30.470 --> 06:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
participating completely and holy in
 
06:00:33.288 --> 06:00:33.298 align:start position:0%
their children's education so I urge you
 
06:00:36.890 --> 06:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
to vote this bill OTP for those reasons
 
06:00:37.970 --> 06:00:37.980 align:start position:0%

06:01:07.490 --> 06:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
parental rights uh issue I want you to
 
06:01:09.170 --> 06:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
know that I stood out front as an
 
06:01:11.090 --> 06:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
activist before I decided to run because
 
06:01:13.070 --> 06:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
it was so important for the last term
 
06:01:14.810 --> 06:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
parental Bill of Rights to pass and it
 
06:01:16.128 --> 06:01:16.138 align:start position:0%
didn't happen
 
06:01:17.868 --> 06:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
um so here I am I want you to know that
 
06:01:19.310 --> 06:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
we represent the people of New Hampshire
 
06:01:20.750 --> 06:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire on both
 
06:01:20.760 --> 06:01:21.650 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire on both
sides

06:01:21.650 --> 06:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
sides
 
06:01:24.470 --> 06:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
I believe want this bill to pass so
 
06:01:26.090 --> 06:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
that's also the only thing I want to get
 
06:01:28.430 --> 06:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
a parent speak about I think that um
 
06:01:30.770 --> 06:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are pinning this to be a
 
06:01:32.628 --> 06:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
trans issue I don't think it is I just
 
06:01:34.190 --> 06:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
want transparency I was on the school
 
06:01:36.708 --> 06:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
board for three years in my town I've
 
06:01:39.288 --> 06:01:39.298 align:start position:0%
seen a lack of transparency as far as
 
06:01:40.850 --> 06:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
what parents have access to know what's
 
06:01:42.110 --> 06:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
going on in the school with their kids
 
06:01:43.490 --> 06:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
and I think this is a very important
 
06:01:44.690 --> 06:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
issue and then it's going to keep coming
 
06:01:47.090 --> 06:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
up so if we don't pass it now it's going
 
06:01:49.548 --> 06:01:49.558 align:start position:0%
to continue to come back parents want to
 
06:01:52.190 --> 06:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
know what's going on in um their kids
 
06:01:54.410 --> 06:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
school so open to questions I'm sure you
 
06:01:56.330 --> 06:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
guys want to move along
 
06:01:57.548 --> 06:01:57.558 align:start position:0%

06:03:36.770 --> 06:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
this is about dealing with what a school
 
06:03:40.010 --> 06:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
system or District plans in a very
 
06:03:41.868 --> 06:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
organized fashion
 
06:03:43.850 --> 06:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
to have more control in the students
 
06:03:43.860 --> 06:03:45.410 align:start position:0%
to have more control in the students
lives

06:03:45.410 --> 06:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
lives
 
06:03:48.530 --> 06:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
representative ball suggested school

meetings with students parents and staff
 
06:03:54.288 --> 06:03:54.298 align:start position:0%
and that is a very good idea because it
 
06:03:57.530 --> 06:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
takes away the secrecy
 
06:04:01.430 --> 06:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
parents have no idea what's going on in
 
06:04:03.948 --> 06:04:03.958 align:start position:0%
their kids schools I've been testifying
 
06:04:06.350 --> 06:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
in my school district school board
 
06:04:08.690 --> 06:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
meetings for two years and I ran for
 
06:04:10.730 --> 06:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
school board and I can tell you what's
 
06:04:12.708 --> 06:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
going on
 
06:04:14.868 --> 06:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
obscene books in the library we've
 
06:04:17.750 --> 06:04:17.760 align:start position:0%

School libraries that are horrendous 85
 
06:04:24.770 --> 06:04:24.780 align:start position:0%

06:04:37.788 --> 06:04:37.798 align:start position:0%
with links to pornographic websites
 
06:04:41.270 --> 06:04:41.280 align:start position:0%

Behavior Specialists and teachers with
 
06:05:00.110 --> 06:05:00.120 align:start position:0%

less than adequate class time focused on
 
06:05:11.090 --> 06:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
academics as evidenced by the very low
 
06:05:13.788 --> 06:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
proficiency scores for 10 years in Dover
 
06:05:15.830 --> 06:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
you have 15 seconds left get the
 
06:05:17.510 --> 06:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
juiciest sentence
 
06:05:19.788 --> 06:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
and curriculum content
 
06:05:23.330 --> 06:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
parents have no clue I have all of it I
 
06:05:26.150 --> 06:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
filed a 91a and I have it
 
06:05:27.890 --> 06:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
I think we need to pass this bill
 
06:05:31.010 --> 06:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
because we need transparency for parents
 
06:05:32.810 --> 06:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:05:34.670 --> 06:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh yes will you take a quick question
 
06:05:38.590 --> 06:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:41.208 --> 06:05:41.218 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:05:42.410 --> 06:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
um I've been doing a little bit of
 
06:05:45.350 --> 06:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
research and I was shocked uh to see and
 
06:05:48.110 --> 06:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
would you believe that uh three quarters
 
06:05:50.810 --> 06:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
of parents are unaware that ninety
 
06:05:52.610 --> 06:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
percent of children beginning at the age
 
06:05:54.788 --> 06:05:54.798 align:start position:0%
of eight have been exposed to online
 
06:05:58.548 --> 06:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
pornography on their telephones on their
 
06:06:01.670 --> 06:06:01.680 align:start position:0%

06:06:01.680 --> 06:06:02.590 align:start position:0%
tablets more often than not in their
homes

06:06:02.590 --> 06:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
homes
 
06:06:05.030 --> 06:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
well but they but they're doing it on
 
06:06:07.730 --> 06:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
the school issued Chromebooks and
 
06:06:09.770 --> 06:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
they're doing it through Sora the
 
06:06:12.110 --> 06:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
library link but they're also doing it
 
06:06:14.948 --> 06:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
through Spotify which is a music link
 
06:06:17.770 --> 06:06:17.780 align:start position:0%
and kinks.com
 
06:06:21.530 --> 06:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh grindr.com these are these links and
 
06:06:24.350 --> 06:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
worse are connected by these books
 
06:06:26.150 --> 06:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
online from the school
 
06:06:28.548 --> 06:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
Sora app
 
06:06:30.410 --> 06:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:06:32.750 --> 06:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much the chair recognizes
 
06:06:35.270 --> 06:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh Heather Mullins with Andy Bemis in
 
06:06:38.510 --> 06:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:40.490 --> 06:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
well Helen Mullins will get another
 
06:06:44.868 --> 06:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
chance then I will recognize Andy Bemis
 
06:06:51.110 --> 06:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:53.150 --> 06:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
06:06:55.368 --> 06:06:55.378 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Andy Bemis I'm
 
06:06:57.830 --> 06:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to hb10 I grew up in New
 
06:06:59.030 --> 06:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at a time when the environment
 
06:07:01.850 --> 06:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
for lgbtq minors and adults was more
 
06:07:04.310 --> 06:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
hostile than it is now as a parent of
 
06:07:05.690 --> 06:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
two teens I've been lucky to see how
 
06:07:07.730 --> 06:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
much better things have gone gotten for
 
06:07:09.948 --> 06:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
my kids and their families the support
 
06:07:11.448 --> 06:07:11.458 align:start position:0%
they get from their friends their
 
06:07:13.788 --> 06:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
families and their teachers uh growing
 
06:07:15.590 --> 06:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
up as transgender is still uniquely
 
06:07:17.090 --> 06:07:17.100 align:start position:0%
challenging under the best circumstances
 
06:07:19.368 --> 06:07:19.378 align:start position:0%
but the love and affirmation these kids
 
06:07:21.590 --> 06:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
receive makes a world of difference and
 
06:07:23.150 --> 06:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
I wish I had had the same when I was
 
06:07:24.530 --> 06:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
growing up
 
06:07:26.270 --> 06:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
powering individual parents to object to
 
06:07:28.910 --> 06:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
lgbtq affirming curriculum and punishing
 
06:07:30.230 --> 06:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
teachers for respecting the confidence
 
06:07:31.730 --> 06:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
of students who may not feel safe
 
06:07:33.470 --> 06:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
disclosing their gender identities to
 
06:07:34.788 --> 06:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
their parents would undermine the
 
06:07:36.590 --> 06:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
support our children rely on
 
06:07:38.390 --> 06:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
parents who object to curriculum related
 
06:07:40.368 --> 06:07:40.378 align:start position:0%
to sexuality already have the freedom to
 
06:07:41.810 --> 06:07:41.820 align:start position:0%
discuss alternate assignments with their
 
06:07:43.368 --> 06:07:43.378 align:start position:0%
students teachers and New Hampshire
 
06:07:45.350 --> 06:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
already requires any adult not only
 
06:07:47.930 --> 06:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
teachers to respect to report suspected
 
06:07:49.490 --> 06:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
child abuse or negligence the
 
06:07:51.110 --> 06:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
representatives who presented this bill
 
06:07:52.788 --> 06:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
have already made a good case for how
 
06:07:54.350 --> 06:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
redundant it is
 
06:07:55.910 --> 06:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
this bill would only succeed in making
 
06:07:57.288 --> 06:07:57.298 align:start position:0%
some of our most vulnerable children
 
06:07:59.628 --> 06:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
less safe and in some cases enable their
 
06:07:59.638 --> 06:08:00.650 align:start position:0%
less safe and in some cases enable their
abuse

06:08:00.650 --> 06:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
06:08:02.750 --> 06:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
if the Bill's authors are motivated by
 
06:08:05.030 --> 06:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
parents rights as they say they are then
 
06:08:06.530 --> 06:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
I urge you to listen to the families
 
06:08:09.530 --> 06:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
that have presented their stories today
 
06:08:11.030 --> 06:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
um there's this idea that keeps coming
 
06:08:12.288 --> 06:08:12.298 align:start position:0%
up I'd like to add that this isn't
 
06:08:14.750 --> 06:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
actually about lgbtq issues so I look
 
06:08:16.128 --> 06:08:16.138 align:start position:0%
forward to the circumstance where a
 
06:08:18.948 --> 06:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
teacher overhears a male student talking
 
06:08:20.990 --> 06:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
about how they have the Huts for a girl
 
06:08:24.170 --> 06:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
and then are compelled to have to tell
 
06:08:26.510 --> 06:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh their parents that their son is in
 
06:08:28.430 --> 06:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
fact straight uh so don't tell me that's
 
06:08:30.048 --> 06:08:30.058 align:start position:0%
not what this is about like if we're
 
06:08:31.850 --> 06:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
here to be honest let's be honest
 
06:08:34.070 --> 06:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
and as for those of you who have
 
06:08:36.770 --> 06:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
testified in opposition for the bill
 
06:08:37.970 --> 06:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
um it's been wonderful hearing your
 
06:08:40.430 --> 06:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
stories today and uh you know I think
 
06:08:41.750 --> 06:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's given me strength and I hope you
 
06:08:42.890 --> 06:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
all feel the same
 
06:08:45.110 --> 06:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:08:47.390 --> 06:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony Paul Santos
 
06:08:49.788 --> 06:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
with David Trumbull
 
06:08:59.868 --> 06:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:01.788 --> 06:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate being
 
06:09:05.628 --> 06:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
here I'm Paul Sontag from the Amherst
 
06:09:08.990 --> 06:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
Milford area South Union Valley and uh
 
06:09:11.150 --> 06:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
before I shot I only have one point I
 
06:09:12.708 --> 06:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
really want to cover from all the rest
 
06:09:14.270 --> 06:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's been touched
 
06:09:16.070 --> 06:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
um but I would just wanted to say that
 
06:09:17.810 --> 06:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
I'm totally
 
06:09:20.990 --> 06:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
um affirming and supportive of all the
 
06:09:23.208 --> 06:09:23.218 align:start position:0%
services that go out to LGBT community
 
06:09:25.730 --> 06:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
so whatever I say please realize that
 
06:09:28.250 --> 06:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
all those services are necessary for you
 
06:09:29.930 --> 06:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
folks to get what you need for mental
 
06:09:31.510 --> 06:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
health Etc
 
06:09:35.570 --> 06:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
my um topic would be it would be talking
 
06:09:35.580 --> 06:09:36.530 align:start position:0%
my um topic would be it would be talking
about

06:09:36.530 --> 06:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:09:38.690 --> 06:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
um the relationship between teachers and
 
06:09:41.150 --> 06:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
parents and and superintendents and
 
06:09:43.070 --> 06:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
School administration we talked a lot
 
06:09:43.080 --> 06:09:43.788 align:start position:0%
School administration we talked a lot
about

06:09:43.788 --> 06:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:09:47.330 --> 06:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
um confidentiality and transparency and
 
06:09:50.208 --> 06:09:50.218 align:start position:0%
um so I've been a teacher principal for
 
06:09:52.730 --> 06:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
30 years and then with extra um
 
06:09:55.548 --> 06:09:55.558 align:start position:0%
experience later on I'm also a recovery
 
06:09:58.310 --> 06:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
coach at the present time but what I'd
 
06:10:01.430 --> 06:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
like to say is about this is that all
 
06:10:03.770 --> 06:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
the teachers that I know look for a
 
06:10:05.570 --> 06:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
school district where they can work with
 
06:10:07.788 --> 06:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
parents they love parents that's why
 
06:10:09.530 --> 06:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
they're there they did not come just to
 
06:10:11.330 --> 06:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
teach to teach subjects they came
 
06:10:12.830 --> 06:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
together and be a relationship with the
 
06:10:15.708 --> 06:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
students and the parents you might not
 
06:10:18.470 --> 06:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
believe that but it's really true and so
 
06:10:22.070 --> 06:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
the idea is for my suggestion here to
 
06:10:23.868 --> 06:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
mitigate a lot of this stuff without a
 
06:10:26.448 --> 06:10:26.458 align:start position:0%
lot of money I would really look for an
 
06:10:29.690 --> 06:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
initiative where parents and and
 
06:10:33.048 --> 06:10:33.058 align:start position:0%
teachers and the administrator can start
 
06:10:36.048 --> 06:10:36.058 align:start position:0%
building relationships one of the issues
 
06:10:37.910 --> 06:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
down here as we said you know if
 
06:10:39.590 --> 06:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
teachers love working with parents
 
06:10:42.530 --> 06:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
that's what I always did you know and
 
06:10:43.970 --> 06:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
parents really want to have a great
 
06:10:45.948 --> 06:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
relationship with their their teachers
 
06:10:47.810 --> 06:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
because they know they're going to get a
 
06:10:49.070 --> 06:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
good education if they have a good
 
06:10:51.110 --> 06:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
relationship with them so what's the key
 
06:10:53.208 --> 06:10:53.218 align:start position:0%
relation what's the key Point here the
 
06:10:55.850 --> 06:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
key point is trust and if you can if
 
06:10:57.708 --> 06:10:57.718 align:start position:0%
parents and teachers can have trust
 
06:10:59.330 --> 06:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
relationship together what do you think
 
06:11:02.150 --> 06:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
the children are going to model
 
06:11:03.708 --> 06:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
what do you think they're going to model
 
06:11:05.690 --> 06:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
they're going to model the adults that
 
06:11:07.430 --> 06:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
are in their life you're already over
 
06:11:09.070 --> 06:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
could you wrap it up in about 10 seconds
 
06:11:12.288 --> 06:11:12.298 align:start position:0%
exactly I could it says you cannot you
 
06:11:14.570 --> 06:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
can't mandate relationship but it'll
 
06:11:16.610 --> 06:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
mitigate a whole lot and I still would
 
06:11:18.288 --> 06:11:18.298 align:start position:0%
suggest that if you get the two to come
 
06:11:19.788 --> 06:11:19.798 align:start position:0%
together and listen to one another we
 
06:11:22.730 --> 06:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
would have great success thank you sir

06:11:26.628 --> 06:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:32.930 --> 06:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:32.940 --> 06:11:36.048 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:11:36.048 --> 06:11:36.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:38.690 --> 06:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for having me I
 
06:11:40.310 --> 06:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
opposed this bill for a couple reasons
 
06:11:42.410 --> 06:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
first of all if this bill is just the
 
06:11:44.750 --> 06:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
catalog of parents rights all listed in
 
06:11:47.750 --> 06:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
one place except for w x and y as was
 
06:11:50.030 --> 06:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
said by one of the presenters then just
 
06:11:52.730 --> 06:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
take out WX and Y why don't we just have
 
06:11:54.410 --> 06:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
a discussion about whether or not we
 
06:11:55.788 --> 06:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
should have a parent's Bill of Rights
 
06:11:59.628 --> 06:11:59.638 align:start position:0%
and then next time talk about lgbtq
 
06:12:01.368 --> 06:12:01.378 align:start position:0%
rights because this is getting conflated
 
06:12:03.170 --> 06:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
into two completely different issues and
 
06:12:05.090 --> 06:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
the losers are going to be the lgbtq
 
06:12:07.490 --> 06:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
children in this state second parents
 
06:12:09.048 --> 06:12:09.058 align:start position:0%
rights are important I'm a parent I have
 
06:12:10.128 --> 06:12:10.138 align:start position:0%
two kids that went through the public
 
06:12:12.530 --> 06:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
schools but they're not absolute they
 
06:12:14.690 --> 06:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
don't all of a sudden get 100 of the
 
06:12:17.270 --> 06:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
rights when they turn 18 it's developed
 
06:12:19.128 --> 06:12:19.138 align:start position:0%
it comes over time just look at your
 
06:12:21.350 --> 06:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
custody cases and divorces the Supreme
 
06:12:22.788 --> 06:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
Court of New Hampshire says that around
 
06:12:25.548 --> 06:12:25.558 align:start position:0%
the age of 13 or 14 the child's wishes
 
06:12:28.070 --> 06:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
become crucial we should recognize and
 
06:12:30.110 --> 06:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
respect children's wishes parents are
 
06:12:31.850 --> 06:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
important but they shouldn't be given
 
06:12:35.390 --> 06:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
extreme Supreme rights number three this
 
06:12:36.890 --> 06:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
bill is only going to affect two
 
06:12:39.230 --> 06:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
situations in the real world homes that
 
06:12:41.208 --> 06:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
are not safe the homes that are safe the
 
06:12:43.190 --> 06:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
parents who support their lgbtq children
 
06:12:45.170 --> 06:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
this bill isn't going to affect them but
 
06:12:47.090 --> 06:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
the places where they're not safe this
 
06:12:48.770 --> 06:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
bill is going to make that child's life
 
06:12:51.230 --> 06:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
much more unsafe and it's not going to
 
06:12:52.910 --> 06:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily lead to abuse it will
 
06:12:54.590 --> 06:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
probably lead to homelessness somewhere
 
06:12:57.410 --> 06:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
between 30 and 40 percent of lgbtq kids
 
06:12:59.690 --> 06:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
especially transgender children end up
 
06:13:01.250 --> 06:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
being homeless that's what's going to
 
06:13:02.628 --> 06:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
happen they're going to get outed and
 
06:13:04.128 --> 06:13:04.138 align:start position:0%
the parent asks a question and they're
 
06:13:05.690 --> 06:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
going to end up out on the street and
 
06:13:07.010 --> 06:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
that's a dangerous place for a young
 
06:13:09.530 --> 06:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
person to be and lastly the person who's
 
06:13:11.930 --> 06:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
also going to lose in this is the lgbtq
 
06:13:14.868 --> 06:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
kids who lose a safe place to be 22
 
06:13:16.788 --> 06:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
percent of high school children in this
 
06:13:19.730 --> 06:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
country according to the CDC or lgbtq
 
06:13:22.510 --> 06:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to be perceived as an
 
06:13:25.610 --> 06:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
anti-lgbtq bill by all of these children
 
06:13:26.990 --> 06:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
they're not going to feel like they can
 
06:13:28.670 --> 06:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
talk to their teachers anymore so
 
06:13:29.990 --> 06:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to lose that one safe
 
06:13:32.270 --> 06:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
place you think that's important one
 
06:13:34.070 --> 06:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
trusted adult reduces the risk of
 
06:13:37.128 --> 06:13:37.138 align:start position:0%
suicide 40 percent I urge you to look up
 
06:13:39.288 --> 06:13:39.298 align:start position:0%
online the Amicus curiai brief in that
 
06:13:41.090 --> 06:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
Manchester lawsuit it's available to
 
06:13:43.490 --> 06:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
everybody it's great reading it's filled
 
06:13:45.530 --> 06:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
with citations and sources with data
 
06:13:47.690 --> 06:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
it's got every single argument you need
 
06:13:49.670 --> 06:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
to know why this bill is bad thank you
 
06:13:51.948 --> 06:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
very much wow you get so much packed in
 
06:13:54.170 --> 06:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
just over two minutes
 
06:13:57.110 --> 06:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
amazing it can be done
 
06:14:00.830 --> 06:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
um it's either Kerry Kerry commentary is
 
06:14:00.840 --> 06:14:01.910 align:start position:0%
um it's either Kerry Kerry commentary is
it

06:14:01.910 --> 06:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:14:05.390 --> 06:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
don't see Paige wood
 
06:14:26.690 --> 06:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:29.690 --> 06:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Paige wood I live in
 
06:14:31.730 --> 06:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
Greenfield New Hampshire
 
06:14:35.090 --> 06:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh and I strongly oppose hb10 this bill
 
06:14:38.810 --> 06:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
endangers lgbtq plus youth as it would
 
06:14:40.548 --> 06:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
dissolve safe and affirming spaces in
 
06:14:42.650 --> 06:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
schools and open them up to abuse
 
06:14:44.868 --> 06:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
rates of depression and suicide among
 
06:14:47.330 --> 06:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
trans youth drop dramatically when they
 
06:14:49.070 --> 06:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
are supported by their family schools
 
06:14:51.170 --> 06:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
and communities unfortunately not all
 
06:14:53.090 --> 06:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
families are supportive a fact that the
 
06:14:55.010 --> 06:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill would rather not
 
06:14:56.208 --> 06:14:56.218 align:start position:0%
think about
 
06:14:58.310 --> 06:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
this bill eliminates a child's autonomy
 
06:15:01.190 --> 06:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
in favor of the absolute Authority of a
 
06:15:01.200 --> 06:15:01.970 align:start position:0%
in favor of the absolute Authority of a
parent

06:15:01.970 --> 06:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
parent
 
06:15:04.430 --> 06:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
I would ask those who support this bill
 
06:15:06.770 --> 06:15:06.780 align:start position:0%
why the rights of a parent trumps the
 
06:15:08.390 --> 06:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
rights of a child
 
06:15:11.030 --> 06:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill claim that the
 
06:15:12.770 --> 06:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
this bill does not permit parents to
 
06:15:14.270 --> 06:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
abuse their children and while that is
 
06:15:14.280 --> 06:15:15.110 align:start position:0%
abuse their children and while that is
true

06:15:15.110 --> 06:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
true
 
06:15:17.030 --> 06:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
it severely limits the ability for
 
06:15:19.910 --> 06:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
educators and medical professionals
 
06:15:22.310 --> 06:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
to prevent abuse
 
06:15:24.590 --> 06:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is nothing but cultural War
 
06:15:27.470 --> 06:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
nonsense masquerading is parental rights
 
06:15:30.890 --> 06:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
and is intended to force lgbtq Plus
 
06:15:34.128 --> 06:15:34.138 align:start position:0%
children back into the closet thank you
 
06:15:36.948 --> 06:15:36.958 align:start position:0%

good afternoon thank you for the
 
06:16:15.230 --> 06:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify I actually wrote
 
06:16:17.270 --> 06:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
a testament testimony and then I changed
 
06:16:18.770 --> 06:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
it nine thousand times I'm going to go
 
06:16:20.150 --> 06:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
back and stick with the original not to
 
06:16:21.770 --> 06:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
confuse everyone
 
06:16:24.708 --> 06:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
my name is Maxine Mosley I am a retired
 
06:16:27.288 --> 06:16:27.298 align:start position:0%
school counselor from Manchester in 43
 
06:16:30.830 --> 06:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
years in my career I served thousands of
 
06:16:32.510 --> 06:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
young people from kindergarten to high
 
06:16:32.520 --> 06:16:33.230 align:start position:0%
young people from kindergarten to high
school

06:16:33.230 --> 06:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:16:34.610 --> 06:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
on the middle school and high school
 
06:16:36.948 --> 06:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
levels I was very often one of the few
 
06:16:39.850 --> 06:16:39.860 align:start position:0%
sounding boards and support systems for
 
06:16:43.490 --> 06:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
glbtq youth it was never my job to tell
 
06:16:45.650 --> 06:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
them what to think or to tell them who
 
06:16:47.868 --> 06:16:47.878 align:start position:0%
they were but to listen and encourage
 
06:16:50.030 --> 06:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
them when they were ready to share their
 
06:16:52.250 --> 06:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
identity with whomever they felt safe
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
sharing that information with including
 
06:16:55.548 --> 06:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
their families
 
06:16:58.430 --> 06:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
it was and never is my role to out
 
06:17:00.530 --> 06:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
anyone to their parents or guardians or
 
06:17:00.540 --> 06:17:01.610 align:start position:0%
anyone to their parents or guardians or
families

06:17:01.610 --> 06:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
families
 
06:17:03.410 --> 06:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
and in many cases and you've heard this
 
06:17:05.628 --> 06:17:05.638 align:start position:0%
term already I was one of the trusted
 
06:17:08.330 --> 06:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
adults let me share a story that just
 
06:17:11.030 --> 06:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
happened two weeks ago I met a 19 year
 
06:17:13.548 --> 06:17:13.558 align:start position:0%
old young person who's now living at a
 
06:17:15.830 --> 06:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
friend's house a friend of mine
 
06:17:17.330 --> 06:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
this youth was kicked out of their
 
06:17:19.070 --> 06:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
parents house because they came out as
 
06:17:21.708 --> 06:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
trans when I met them my first question
 
06:17:24.770 --> 06:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
is what are your pronouns my friend who
 
06:17:26.690 --> 06:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
is considerably older than me was
 
06:17:28.250 --> 06:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
confused about why I would ask that
 
06:17:30.770 --> 06:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
question I explained because I wanted to
 
06:17:31.788 --> 06:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
communicate with this person
 
06:17:34.610 --> 06:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
respectfully and how they wished to be
 
06:17:37.970 --> 06:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
referred to and as the most amazing
 
06:17:39.470 --> 06:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
thing happened and this has happened
 
06:17:41.510 --> 06:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
throughout my professional career
 
06:17:44.930 --> 06:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
this youth gave me a big smile a hug and
 
06:17:46.788 --> 06:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
just started talking about their
 
06:17:48.770 --> 06:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
struggles and their pain
 
06:17:50.570 --> 06:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
they shared with me how they had thought
 
06:17:52.368 --> 06:17:52.378 align:start position:0%
about joining the military
 
06:17:54.288 --> 06:17:54.298 align:start position:0%
because they knew they would put be put
 
06:17:56.270 --> 06:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
in a position to die
 
06:17:59.390 --> 06:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
and I will add that they said and die so
 
06:18:01.128 --> 06:18:01.138 align:start position:0%
my parents would think that I would I
 
06:18:03.770 --> 06:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
could be honored
 
06:18:06.010 --> 06:18:06.020 align:start position:0%
their parents wanted them to be fixed
 
06:18:08.270 --> 06:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
changed and to make an active decision
 
06:18:11.270 --> 06:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
not to be a trans person I am still
 
06:18:13.730 --> 06:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
evolving and learning at almost 68 years
 
06:18:13.740 --> 06:18:14.690 align:start position:0%
evolving and learning at almost 68 years
old

06:18:14.690 --> 06:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
old
 
06:18:17.628 --> 06:18:17.638 align:start position:0%
but my heart knows how wrong this is in
 
06:18:19.190 --> 06:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
a world where compassion and connection
 
06:18:21.288 --> 06:18:21.298 align:start position:0%
is everything this young person was
 
06:18:23.090 --> 06:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
considering Ways to Die
 
06:18:24.708 --> 06:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
because of the shame that was thrust
 
06:18:26.390 --> 06:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
upon them for who they were and now
 
06:18:27.890 --> 06:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
you're over time would you give us about
 
06:18:30.590 --> 06:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
15 seconds more to wrap it up I will
 
06:18:32.628 --> 06:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
thank you turning the page over didn't
 
06:18:35.330 --> 06:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
count against it you can go now
 
06:18:37.850 --> 06:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
um criminalizing Educators is what this
 
06:18:40.430 --> 06:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
bill will do I've been an educator my
 
06:18:42.590 --> 06:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
entire life we have continued to be
 
06:18:44.448 --> 06:18:44.458 align:start position:0%
muzzled about how we care for children
 
06:18:47.570 --> 06:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with the parental
 
06:18:49.330 --> 06:18:49.340 align:start position:0%
rights about curriculum
 
06:18:52.490 --> 06:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
assemblies guest speakers I'm all for
 
06:18:54.890 --> 06:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
that but when you ask an educator to
 
06:18:57.350 --> 06:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
respond to a parent about sexualized
 
06:18:59.150 --> 06:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
questions about their children it's
 
06:19:01.250 --> 06:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
wrong thank you so much for your
 
06:19:03.110 --> 06:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair now recognizes
 
06:19:07.310 --> 06:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
Maggie O'Neill with Katie Masters
 
06:19:14.750 --> 06:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:16.310 --> 06:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's high tech
 
06:19:19.250 --> 06:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning my name is Maggie
 
06:19:21.230 --> 06:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
O'Neill I drove about an hour from
 
06:19:23.150 --> 06:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
Newmarket to be here so thank you for
 
06:19:25.490 --> 06:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony
 
06:19:28.548 --> 06:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
um I want to express my opposition to
 
06:19:30.830 --> 06:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
The Spill
 
06:19:33.110 --> 06:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
um it concerns me for several reasons
 
06:19:36.048 --> 06:19:36.058 align:start position:0%
one I'll go back to my eighth grade year
 
06:19:39.410 --> 06:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
when I did not yet know that I was queer
 
06:19:42.650 --> 06:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
but a teacher figured it out actually
 
06:19:47.690 --> 06:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
before I did and informed me and luckily
 
06:19:49.670 --> 06:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
they did not out me to my parents
 
06:19:52.190 --> 06:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
because I grew up in a Catholic
 
06:19:54.230 --> 06:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
household so it was a bit of a question
 
06:19:57.110 --> 06:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
of when I could come out to my parents
 
06:20:00.410 --> 06:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
safely I eventually did on my own terms
 
06:20:02.150 --> 06:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we have a beautiful loving
 
06:20:05.570 --> 06:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
relationship now but it was my choice
 
06:20:10.150 --> 06:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
um and so for Trans students who are
 
06:20:10.160 --> 06:20:11.770 align:start position:0%
um and so for Trans students who are
experiencing

06:20:11.770 --> 06:20:11.780 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
06:20:14.448 --> 06:20:14.458 align:start position:0%
questions about their pronouns and
 
06:20:16.090 --> 06:20:16.100 align:start position:0%
trying out new names
 
06:20:20.208 --> 06:20:20.218 align:start position:0%
this is a real a real issue when I
 
06:20:22.610 --> 06:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
eventually went to college I became a
 
06:20:25.250 --> 06:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
teacher I've taught in schools I've
 
06:20:28.490 --> 06:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
taught in after school programs and I've
 
06:20:31.310 --> 06:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
had students come out to me and try out
 
06:20:34.788 --> 06:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
new pronouns with me let me know hey I'm
 
06:20:37.250 --> 06:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
going by the this name and please don't
 
06:20:39.890 --> 06:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
tell my parents the reason they try this
 
06:20:42.708 --> 06:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
out is because it's a safe space and
 
06:20:45.650 --> 06:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
it's lower Stakes their most important
 
06:20:47.750 --> 06:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
relationship is with their caretaker
 
06:20:50.150 --> 06:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
their Guardian they want to make sure
 
06:20:53.448 --> 06:20:53.458 align:start position:0%
that they can safely make this change in
 
06:20:56.650 --> 06:20:56.660 align:start position:0%
a lower Stakes atmosphere and I respect
 
06:20:56.660 --> 06:20:58.270 align:start position:0%
a lower Stakes atmosphere and I respect
teenagers

06:20:58.270 --> 06:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
teenagers
 
06:21:01.910 --> 06:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
autonomy nobody's going to be harmed by
 
06:21:04.250 --> 06:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
trying out new pronouns and trying out a
 
06:21:06.350 --> 06:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
new name so to include that kind of
 
06:21:09.770 --> 06:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
information in a bill that's purporting
 
06:21:12.170 --> 06:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
to protect children from all kinds of
 
06:21:14.750 --> 06:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
dangers is quite frankly an insulting to
 
06:21:17.390 --> 06:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
those in the trans Community I urge you
 
06:21:19.310 --> 06:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
to oppose this legislation thank you
 
06:21:21.948 --> 06:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
very much thank you and now the chair
 
06:21:24.590 --> 06:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
recognizes Katie master with Bill Blum
 
06:21:28.850 --> 06:21:28.860 align:start position:0%

afternoon uh my name is Katie Masters
 
06:21:47.448 --> 06:21:47.458 align:start position:0%
and I am a resident of Littleton I am
 
06:21:49.250 --> 06:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
testing testifying today in opposition
 
06:21:52.128 --> 06:21:52.138 align:start position:0%
of hb10 my opposition stems from the
 
06:21:53.810 --> 06:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
language of the bill that allows parents
 
06:21:55.730 --> 06:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
to call for restriction of access to
 
06:21:57.890 --> 06:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed data on gender and sexual
 
06:21:57.900 --> 06:21:59.090 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed data on gender and sexual
orientation

06:21:59.090 --> 06:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
orientation
 
06:22:01.548 --> 06:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
I grew up in Stewartstown where there
 
06:22:04.010 --> 06:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
were nine kids in my class from a young
 
06:22:06.170 --> 06:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
age I was ostracized by my classmates
 
06:22:08.510 --> 06:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
for a myriad of reasons from being the
 
06:22:10.490 --> 06:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
stereotypical nerd to being overweight
 
06:22:12.410 --> 06:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
to not being interested in sports or
 
06:22:14.810 --> 06:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
other recreational activities well I've
 
06:22:17.090 --> 06:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
only realized as an adult is that I also
 
06:22:19.128 --> 06:22:19.138 align:start position:0%
felt othered because I did not fit into
 
06:22:21.948 --> 06:22:21.958 align:start position:0%
our society's gender Norms if given the
 
06:22:23.448 --> 06:22:23.458 align:start position:0%
knowledge and opportunity I could have
 
06:22:25.490 --> 06:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
come to terms with who I am at a younger
 
06:22:27.470 --> 06:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
age and while I would not have found my
 
06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
people in that group of nine kids I
 
06:22:31.368 --> 06:22:31.378 align:start position:0%
could have found peace that people like
 
06:22:34.070 --> 06:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
me exist and could be found Even in our
 
06:22:37.190 --> 06:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
rural Northern Communities hb10 would
 
06:22:39.048 --> 06:22:39.058 align:start position:0%
ensure that kids like me have no chance
 
06:22:41.510 --> 06:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
of accessing information that could not
 
06:22:43.430 --> 06:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
only show them a whole world beyond our
 
06:22:45.830 --> 06:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
smaller isolated communities where they
 
06:22:48.110 --> 06:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
don't fit in but it could save their
 
06:22:50.570 --> 06:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
lives as someone who can be counted in
 
06:22:52.850 --> 06:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
the statistics of lgbtq Youth who have
 
06:22:54.530 --> 06:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
suffered from depression and suicide
 
06:22:56.390 --> 06:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
attempts I strongly urge this committee
 
06:22:58.490 --> 06:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
to oppose furthering this bill our
 
06:23:00.170 --> 06:23:00.180 align:start position:0%
children deserve every opportunity to
 
06:23:01.970 --> 06:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
grow into their full potential with
 
06:23:03.890 --> 06:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
compassion understanding and the ability
 
06:23:05.750 --> 06:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
to access information beyond their
 
06:23:07.910 --> 06:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
family group which like my own may not
 
06:23:10.070 --> 06:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
have been a safe may not be a safe space
 
06:23:12.590 --> 06:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
to Foster that potential to say that
 
06:23:14.750 --> 06:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
this is a protectionist bill is a lie as
 
06:23:16.490 --> 06:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
it hides State interference in the
 
06:23:17.570 --> 06:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
rights of our children for
 
06:23:19.910 --> 06:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
self-discovery in favor of fear of
 
06:23:21.830 --> 06:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
anything different and parading it as
 
06:23:24.350 --> 06:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
rights for parents being different and
 
06:23:26.510 --> 06:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
accepting that has Set Me Free and
 
06:23:28.430 --> 06:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
brought me joy in ways that I have never
 
06:23:30.230 --> 06:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
felt in the three decades of my life
 
06:23:32.510 --> 06:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
leading up to the present I am better
 
06:23:34.850 --> 06:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
for it and others like me would be as
 
06:23:34.860 --> 06:23:36.230 align:start position:0%
for it and others like me would be as
well

06:23:36.230 --> 06:23:36.240 align:start position:0%

Blum
 
06:23:55.850 --> 06:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in opposition against
 
06:23:59.570 --> 06:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
this legislation it's been identified
 
06:23:59.580 --> 06:24:00.708 align:start position:0%
this legislation it's been identified
and

06:24:00.708 --> 06:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:24:02.330 --> 06:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
there was some last minute changes to it
 
06:24:03.770 --> 06:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
I didn't have time to sit there and read
 
06:24:05.628 --> 06:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
six pages of it so I apologize I'm
 
06:24:07.310 --> 06:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
speaking against
 
06:24:10.070 --> 06:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
something that was in the original bill
 
06:24:12.170 --> 06:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
um that is no longer present uh this
 
06:24:13.430 --> 06:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
bill is called the parental Bill of
 
06:24:13.440 --> 06:24:14.570 align:start position:0%
bill is called the parental Bill of
Rights

06:24:14.570 --> 06:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
06:24:16.548 --> 06:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
um very similar legislation passed in
 
06:24:19.190 --> 06:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
Florida also known as don't say gay
 
06:24:21.010 --> 06:24:21.020 align:start position:0%
so I want to recognize that
 
06:24:23.868 --> 06:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
as being what it is
 
06:24:26.810 --> 06:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq plus Community is under attack
 
06:24:28.910 --> 06:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
right now and I feel that this bill is a
 
06:24:31.250 --> 06:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
direct attack to my community
 
06:24:33.170 --> 06:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
as a parent
 
06:24:36.650 --> 06:24:36.660 align:start position:0%
my child my oldest one who's 17 did in
 
06:24:38.390 --> 06:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
fact change their name as well as a
 
06:24:39.948 --> 06:24:39.958 align:start position:0%
pronoun at the school that I was unaware
 
06:24:42.350 --> 06:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
of that had happened but guess what it
 
06:24:43.610 --> 06:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
didn't change
 
06:24:45.590 --> 06:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
anything at home
 
06:24:47.690 --> 06:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
you're still my child
 
06:24:49.610 --> 06:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
we talked about parental Bill of Rights
 
06:24:51.350 --> 06:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
earlier about how we need to make sure
 
06:24:53.090 --> 06:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
that the parents are in charge of the
 
06:24:54.410 --> 06:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
situation this reminds me of colonial
 
06:24:54.420 --> 06:24:55.310 align:start position:0%
situation this reminds me of colonial
times

06:24:55.310 --> 06:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
times
 
06:24:56.990 --> 06:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
kids not property they're not dogs
 
06:24:59.750 --> 06:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
they're not your piece of land
 
06:25:02.390 --> 06:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
they're actual human beings my job as a
 
06:25:05.270 --> 06:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
parent is not to control them my job is
 
06:25:07.310 --> 06:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
to provide a safe space for them to
 
06:25:10.250 --> 06:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
thrive whatever they that may be it may
 
06:25:13.490 --> 06:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
be my son my daughter my non-binary
 
06:25:16.310 --> 06:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
individual don't care
 
06:25:16.320 --> 06:25:17.930 align:start position:0%
individual don't care
um

06:25:17.930 --> 06:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:22.010 --> 06:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
things happen a lot that parents won't
 
06:25:25.610 --> 06:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
understand and without safe spaces
 
06:25:27.770 --> 06:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
I.E schools
 
06:25:29.628 --> 06:25:29.638 align:start position:0%
our children won't have a safe place to
 
06:25:31.010 --> 06:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
talk the
 
06:25:33.230 --> 06:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
earlier a few minutes ago the gentleman
 
06:25:34.430 --> 06:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
in front of me created his own safe
 
06:25:35.690 --> 06:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
Space by having a pistol in his
 
06:25:37.850 --> 06:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
waistband guess what I didn't really
 
06:25:39.590 --> 06:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
care about that
 
06:25:40.970 --> 06:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
this is New Hampshire where I'll have
 
06:25:46.730 --> 06:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:48.890 --> 06:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
I also want to recognize that that brief
 
06:25:48.900 --> 06:25:49.910 align:start position:0%
I also want to recognize that that brief
pause

06:25:49.910 --> 06:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
pause
 
06:25:49.920 --> 06:25:51.770 align:start position:0%
pause
was

06:25:51.770 --> 06:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:25:53.510 --> 06:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
a moment of silence
 
06:25:56.350 --> 06:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
for the people who will take their life
 
06:25:59.030 --> 06:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
if harmful legislation is passed like
 
06:26:01.970 --> 06:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
this I may not know your name ever they
 
06:26:03.530 --> 06:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
were a few successful in taking your
 
06:26:06.048 --> 06:26:06.058 align:start position:0%
life but I will recognize that passing
 
06:26:07.730 --> 06:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
this legislation will provide an outlet
 
06:26:09.590 --> 06:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
for that to happen thank you for your
 
06:26:09.600 --> 06:26:10.850 align:start position:0%
for that to happen thank you for your
testimony

06:26:10.850 --> 06:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:26:21.368 --> 06:26:21.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:23.868 --> 06:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
06:26:25.610 --> 06:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
I'm a little nervous I've never done
 
06:26:28.368 --> 06:26:28.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:30.948 --> 06:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
um my name is Mary and I'm from Loudon
 
06:26:32.750 --> 06:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
06:26:37.448 --> 06:26:37.458 align:start position:0%
I'm a veteran I'm a parent a grandparent
 
06:26:40.788 --> 06:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
I feel like we are on a very slippery
 
06:26:40.798 --> 06:26:41.810 align:start position:0%
I feel like we are on a very slippery
slope

06:26:41.810 --> 06:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
slope
 
06:26:41.820 --> 06:26:43.610 align:start position:0%
slope
China

06:26:43.610 --> 06:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
China
 
06:26:46.368 --> 06:26:46.378 align:start position:0%
children are governed by the government
 
06:26:50.030 --> 06:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
through their school systems
 
06:26:52.850 --> 06:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
we are the United States of America we
 
06:26:54.948 --> 06:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
are Live Free or Die state
 
06:26:57.770 --> 06:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
I believe everyone has an opportunity to
 
06:27:00.288 --> 06:27:00.298 align:start position:0%
live their life the way that they choose
 
06:27:01.850 --> 06:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
I don't feel
 
06:27:04.850 --> 06:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
I am in support of the parental rights
 
06:27:07.128 --> 06:27:07.138 align:start position:0%
because I do believe that every parent
 
06:27:09.470 --> 06:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
has a right to raise their children as
 
06:27:12.590 --> 06:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
they see fit and not somebody else and
 
06:27:14.810 --> 06:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
what their ideas are
 
06:27:17.390 --> 06:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
I believe that open communication is
 
06:27:17.400 --> 06:27:19.368 align:start position:0%
I believe that open communication is
successful

06:27:19.368 --> 06:27:19.378 align:start position:0%
successful
 
06:27:22.368 --> 06:27:22.378 align:start position:0%
between teachers and parents and the
 
06:27:22.378 --> 06:27:23.270 align:start position:0%
between teachers and parents and the
children

06:27:23.270 --> 06:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:27:26.030 --> 06:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes children are confused more
 
06:27:29.090 --> 06:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
often than not and if you lie to the
 
06:27:31.128 --> 06:27:31.138 align:start position:0%
parents or you conceal from the parents
 
06:27:32.990 --> 06:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
how are they supposed to be part of the
 
06:27:36.310 --> 06:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
solution of their children's upbringing
 
06:27:39.350 --> 06:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
one other thing is that it's not really
 
06:27:40.810 --> 06:27:40.820 align:start position:0%
just about
 
06:27:44.030 --> 06:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
lgbtq whatever it's
 
06:27:45.948 --> 06:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
um it could be a young girl who got
 
06:27:49.250 --> 06:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
pregnant it could be someone who's gay
 
06:27:49.260 --> 06:27:51.110 align:start position:0%
pregnant it could be someone who's gay
that

06:27:51.110 --> 06:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:27:55.010 --> 06:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
their parents are really okay with it if
 
06:27:57.230 --> 06:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
they only knew but if it's held from
 
06:27:59.270 --> 06:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
them they're not part of that nurturing
 
06:27:59.280 --> 06:28:01.250 align:start position:0%
them they're not part of that nurturing
process

06:28:01.250 --> 06:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:28:04.610 --> 06:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
the bottom line that I believe is that I
 
06:28:06.650 --> 06:28:06.660 align:start position:0%
don't believe I don't understand why
 
06:28:09.230 --> 06:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
we're here talking about if we should
 
06:28:13.910 --> 06:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:17.208 --> 06:28:17.218 align:start position:0%
but I believe that it's important that
 
06:28:20.208 --> 06:28:20.218 align:start position:0%
we don't go down that slippery slope and
 
06:28:23.868 --> 06:28:23.878 align:start position:0%
avoid or cut off parental rights for our
 
06:28:25.730 --> 06:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
children so I am in support of it and
 
06:28:27.948 --> 06:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
thank you you did great for your first
 
06:28:32.150 --> 06:28:32.160 align:start position:0%

06:28:34.610 --> 06:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Haley Brown

hello my name is Haley and I'm here
 
06:28:54.350 --> 06:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
today in opposition of hb10
 
06:28:56.690 --> 06:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
I believe from my own experience this
 
06:28:58.368 --> 06:28:58.378 align:start position:0%
bill puts New Hampshire Children at Risk
 
06:29:00.590 --> 06:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
apart we must believe our children who
 
06:29:03.230 --> 06:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
report abuse no child lives in fear of
 
06:29:05.690 --> 06:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
their parents for no reason I grew up in
 
06:29:07.430 --> 06:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
a violent religious household
 
06:29:09.110 --> 06:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
when a close relative was outed when I
 
06:29:10.610 --> 06:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
was eight years old I learned that I
 
06:29:11.810 --> 06:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
could not safely come out while living
 
06:29:13.730 --> 06:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
at home no Outsider could have
 
06:29:15.590 --> 06:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
adequately assessed this risk like many
 
06:29:18.288 --> 06:29:18.298 align:start position:0%
abuses abusers my parents coached us on
 
06:29:19.670 --> 06:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
how to lie to Child Protective Services
 
06:29:22.010 --> 06:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
I needed adults to believe me about the
 
06:29:23.750 --> 06:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
abuse I experienced in spite of my
 
06:29:25.310 --> 06:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
parents carefully curated good
 
06:29:25.320 --> 06:29:26.570 align:start position:0%
parents carefully curated good
reputation

06:29:26.570 --> 06:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
reputation
 
06:29:28.850 --> 06:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
no child is too young to disclose abuse
 
06:29:30.650 --> 06:29:30.660 align:start position:0%
we would not deny a child protection
 
06:29:32.208 --> 06:29:32.218 align:start position:0%
when they disclose any other reason to
 
06:29:34.430 --> 06:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
fear their parents abuse most parents
 
06:29:36.470 --> 06:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
are good and loving but my faith as a
 
06:29:37.730 --> 06:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
Christian teaches me that the shepherd
 
06:29:40.250 --> 06:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
leaves the 99 to save the one queer
 
06:29:42.288 --> 06:29:42.298 align:start position:0%
children are the one even one child
 
06:29:45.110 --> 06:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
dying or being abused as a result of

condone that abuse it will trigger it it
 
06:29:55.850 --> 06:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
will cause it and we need to ask
 
06:29:57.650 --> 06:29:57.660 align:start position:0%
ourselves how we can be preventing that
 
06:30:00.410 --> 06:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
proactively children are not closeted

worked so hard to break down if you
 
06:35:02.690 --> 06:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
would like to see New Hampshire continue

I'm a professional and I live and work

in Concord and I'm a parent of a
 
06:35:53.930 --> 06:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
transgender son I'm testifying in
 
06:35:57.770 --> 06:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb10 and SB 272 and the
 
06:35:59.690 --> 06:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
other anti-trans bills today
 
06:36:01.670 --> 06:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
I would be remiss if I didn't note the
 
06:36:03.470 --> 06:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
lack of decorum that I feel in
 
06:36:05.570 --> 06:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
presenting a six-page Amendment right
 
06:36:08.030 --> 06:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
before testimony began and also not in
 
06:36:09.890 --> 06:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
Red Line it made it incredibly difficult
 
06:36:12.530 --> 06:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney and it made it very
 
06:36:14.150 --> 06:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
difficult for me to assess what was been
 
06:36:16.430 --> 06:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
changed and I find that interesting at
 
06:36:16.440 --> 06:36:17.208 align:start position:0%
changed and I find that interesting at
best

06:36:17.208 --> 06:36:17.218 align:start position:0%
best
 
06:36:19.070 --> 06:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
these bills are aimed at suppressing
 
06:36:20.570 --> 06:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights and interfering with
 
06:36:22.128 --> 06:36:22.138 align:start position:0%
the students autonomy and matters that
 
06:36:23.750 --> 06:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
are deeply personal and best known to
 
06:36:25.730 --> 06:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
the individual student these bills
 
06:36:27.288 --> 06:36:27.298 align:start position:0%
require parents to be completely and
 
06:36:28.970 --> 06:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
truthfully informed if a student is
 
06:36:30.470 --> 06:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
being identified as a different name
 
06:36:32.448 --> 06:36:32.458 align:start position:0%
gender or pronouns then they were
 
06:36:34.190 --> 06:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
enrolled as these bills also require
 
06:36:35.930 --> 06:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
that parents be informed as to any
 
06:36:38.448 --> 06:36:38.458 align:start position:0%
extratricular correct activities clubs
 
06:36:40.570 --> 06:36:40.580 align:start position:0%
or organizations their students
 
06:36:43.190 --> 06:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
participate again this begs the question
 
06:36:44.690 --> 06:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
why would a parent with a healthy
 
06:36:46.128 --> 06:36:46.138 align:start position:0%
relationship with their child be unable
 
06:36:48.590 --> 06:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
to have these conversations directly
 
06:36:50.330 --> 06:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
why are we being led to believe that
 
06:36:52.128 --> 06:36:52.138 align:start position:0%
there's a need for the step to the state
 
06:36:54.948 --> 06:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
to step in it seems clear that the
 
06:36:56.628 --> 06:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
children being targeted by these bills
 
06:36:58.190 --> 06:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
are likely living in a home that's not
 
06:36:58.200 --> 06:36:59.090 align:start position:0%
are likely living in a home that's not
safe

06:36:59.090 --> 06:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
safe
 
06:37:00.708 --> 06:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
and the state has no business in
 
06:37:02.330 --> 06:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
advancing any agenda that puts these
 
06:37:04.128 --> 06:37:04.138 align:start position:0%
children at a higher risk
 
06:37:06.048 --> 06:37:06.058 align:start position:0%
these bills overreach by requiring
 
06:37:07.850 --> 06:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
school districts to provide an opt-out
 
06:37:11.390 --> 06:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
for certain instruction about sexuality
 
06:37:13.190 --> 06:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
these bills establish a path toward
 
06:37:14.868 --> 06:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
discipline for any School employee and
 
06:37:16.670 --> 06:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
encourages our courses or attempts to
 
06:37:18.470 --> 06:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
encourage our course A minor child to
 
06:37:20.628 --> 06:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
withhold information from their parent
 
06:37:22.490 --> 06:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
and contain a requirement that school
 
06:37:24.170 --> 06:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
districts develop procedures for a
 
06:37:25.490 --> 06:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
parent to learn about the nature and
 
06:37:27.288 --> 06:37:27.298 align:start position:0%
purpose of clubs and activities offered
 
06:37:29.628 --> 06:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
to his or her minor child's School
 
06:37:32.510 --> 06:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
including those that are extracurricular
 
06:37:34.310 --> 06:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
I have heard several times today that
 
06:37:35.628 --> 06:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
some don't understand why we're even
 
06:37:35.638 --> 06:37:37.070 align:start position:0%
some don't understand why we're even
here

06:37:37.070 --> 06:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:37:39.470 --> 06:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
I would note that that's a privilege
 
06:37:41.810 --> 06:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
you are at two minutes and give us 15
 
06:37:44.270 --> 06:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
seconds more please I'll wrap it up as a

06:37:47.090 --> 06:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
like these that encourage daily
 
06:37:49.250 --> 06:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
systematic attacks on his very existence
 
06:37:51.230 --> 06:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
and they put him in danger as a
 
06:37:52.670 --> 06:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
legislator voting in favor of these
 
06:37:54.650 --> 06:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
bills you are in fact culpable
 
06:37:56.270 --> 06:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
according to every Major Medical
 
06:37:58.490 --> 06:37:58.500 align:start position:0%

50 years I spent 40 years working as a
 
06:38:55.610 --> 06:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
clinical supervisor in residential uh
 
06:38:58.250 --> 06:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
care with many children uh coming there

as a result of abuse and neglect and
 
06:39:03.708 --> 06:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
significant mental health issues I I
 
06:39:06.470 --> 06:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
have and I'm just looking at the faces I
 
06:39:08.930 --> 06:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
I think likewise have been strongly
 
06:39:12.590 --> 06:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
affected by the voices of of Emma and
 
06:39:15.890 --> 06:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
Paige and Derek who spoke about their
 
06:39:19.010 --> 06:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
direct experience about this I'm also a
 
06:39:20.570 --> 06:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
parent a grandparent and a great
 
06:39:24.470 --> 06:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
grandparent and in my in my profession
 
06:39:26.750 --> 06:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
we spoke about this very briefly is
 
06:39:30.048 --> 06:39:30.058 align:start position:0%
about confidentiality confidentiality is
 
06:39:33.110 --> 06:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
a central tenet of our culture saying
 
06:39:34.850 --> 06:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be places that
 
06:39:37.850 --> 06:39:37.860 align:start position:0%
people can share their stories uh one of
 
06:39:39.708 --> 06:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of the bill talked about
 
06:39:42.530 --> 06:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
things that they never said to their to
 
06:39:45.350 --> 06:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
their parents almost all of us who have
 
06:39:47.208 --> 06:39:47.218 align:start position:0%
been parents know that we are fortunate
 
06:39:49.430 --> 06:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
that other people have been there to
 
06:39:52.010 --> 06:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
listen to our parents not about problems
 
06:39:55.368 --> 06:39:55.378 align:start position:0%
with uh the parenting but the simple
 
06:39:57.650 --> 06:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
fact to be able to have somebody else to
 
06:39:59.628 --> 06:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
be able to share and work it through so
 
06:40:02.990 --> 06:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's why we have confidentiality laws
 
06:40:05.208 --> 06:40:05.218 align:start position:0%
and they're very specific
 
06:40:07.250 --> 06:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
um about what are their protections and
 
06:40:09.350 --> 06:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
what what has to be disclosed and
 
06:40:10.788 --> 06:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
generally that's around the framework
 
06:40:13.070 --> 06:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
which what that which is dangerous to
 
06:40:16.610 --> 06:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
the person or dangerous outside so we
 
06:40:19.670 --> 06:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
have that already uh built in we we have
 
06:40:21.770 --> 06:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
stories here that have been showed about
 
06:40:25.970 --> 06:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
things that went uh wrong and uh about
 
06:40:30.070 --> 06:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh allegedly when uh
 
06:40:32.690 --> 06:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
professionals don't share their stories
 
06:40:35.930 --> 06:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
but we also know the stories about when
 
06:40:38.990 --> 06:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
things went wrong in the other ways I
 
06:40:40.730 --> 06:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
have direct experience at one of my
 
06:40:44.350 --> 06:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues was involved with a family
 
06:40:47.628 --> 06:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
and the the family particularly the
 
06:40:50.030 --> 06:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
father was so opposed by the
 
06:40:53.570 --> 06:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
intervention quote by the state uh so
 
06:40:55.128 --> 06:40:55.138 align:start position:0%
you're over if you could give his 15
 
06:41:00.650 --> 06:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:00.660 --> 06:41:04.448 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:41:04.448 --> 06:41:04.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:07.128 --> 06:41:07.138 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you
 
06:41:09.770 --> 06:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
um that
 
06:41:11.690 --> 06:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:41:13.788 --> 06:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
um and I'm opposed to it is that I'm
 
06:41:17.208 --> 06:41:17.218 align:start position:0%
fear unintentionally what it does is it
 
06:41:21.048 --> 06:41:21.058 align:start position:0%
makes more kids at risk 40 percent uh
 
06:41:23.990 --> 06:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
Improvement rate when trans kids have
 
06:41:26.270 --> 06:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
somebody to talk to
 
06:41:29.150 --> 06:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you now so much and the chair
 
06:41:31.970 --> 06:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
calls on Hayden Smiths followed by
 
06:41:42.070 --> 06:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:44.030 --> 06:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon members of the
 
06:41:45.530 --> 06:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Hayden Smith and
 
06:41:46.910 --> 06:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
I'm from Hanover and I'm here
 
06:41:48.170 --> 06:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire youth
 
06:41:49.670 --> 06:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
movement to testify in opposition to
 
06:41:52.128 --> 06:41:52.138 align:start position:0%
hb10 our movement includes many New
 
06:41:53.448 --> 06:41:53.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire High School students who would
 
06:41:55.128 --> 06:41:55.138 align:start position:0%
be affected by this legislation but are
 
06:41:57.048 --> 06:41:57.058 align:start position:0%
not able to be here today to speak on it
 
06:41:58.910 --> 06:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
due to school so I'd like to speak a bit
 
06:42:00.770 --> 06:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
on their behalf on why this bill is
 
06:42:03.048 --> 06:42:03.058 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and even harmful
 
06:42:04.910 --> 06:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
our students have told us time and again
 
06:42:06.708 --> 06:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
that they want what they want out of
 
06:42:08.330 --> 06:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
school is a stimulating education that
 
06:42:09.830 --> 06:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
will prepare them to navigate and thrive
 
06:42:11.510 --> 06:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the complicated worlds they'll be
 
06:42:13.670 --> 06:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
living in as adults this includes
 
06:42:15.110 --> 06:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
engaging with topics that may be
 
06:42:16.970 --> 06:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable to their parents but still
 
06:42:18.530 --> 06:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
necessary to make informed decisions
 
06:42:20.628 --> 06:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
about their health and livelihood I
 
06:42:22.368 --> 06:42:22.378 align:start position:0%
remember learning about HIV AIDS in
 
06:42:24.110 --> 06:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
fifth grade and while the topic may have
 
06:42:25.730 --> 06:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
produced some awkward conversations with
 
06:42:27.708 --> 06:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
my parents it proved to be Vital
 
06:42:30.530 --> 06:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
Information for safeguarding my health
 
06:42:32.690 --> 06:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this Bill runs counter to
 
06:42:34.128 --> 06:42:34.138 align:start position:0%
what our students want by encouraging
 
06:42:36.110 --> 06:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
students to unilaterally cut their their
 
06:42:37.850 --> 06:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
children off from learning about issues
 
06:42:38.868 --> 06:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
in school that they're not comfortable
 
06:42:41.330 --> 06:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
with now parental discomfort with
 
06:42:42.590 --> 06:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
certain topics in their children's
 
06:42:45.470 --> 06:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
education is understandable but there
 
06:42:47.030 --> 06:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
are more constructive and less
 
06:42:48.770 --> 06:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
confrontational ways of approaching the
 
06:42:51.170 --> 06:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
situation than what this bill prescribes
 
06:42:52.970 --> 06:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is also an example of
 
06:42:54.650 --> 06:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
why we need to be over why we need to be
 
06:42:57.170 --> 06:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
cautious about over legislating HP 10
 
06:42:58.548 --> 06:42:58.558 align:start position:0%
includes many statements about what
 
06:43:00.288 --> 06:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
parents can and can't do that are
 
06:43:03.310 --> 06:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
already widely recognized
 
06:43:05.628 --> 06:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
and they're accepted by the public and
 
06:43:07.788 --> 06:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
by local law but it mixes them with
 
06:43:09.230 --> 06:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
provisions and enforcement mechanisms
 
06:43:10.788 --> 06:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
that are unnecessary and could carry
 
06:43:13.250 --> 06:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
harmful consequences most if not all
 
06:43:14.510 --> 06:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
school districts in the state for
 
06:43:16.010 --> 06:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
example already have a process through
 
06:43:17.510 --> 06:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
which a parent can inquire about their
 
06:43:19.490 --> 06:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
child schooling and even request that
 
06:43:20.990 --> 06:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
their student not have access to certain
 
06:43:23.570 --> 06:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
materials but this bill creates its own
 
06:43:25.368 --> 06:43:25.378 align:start position:0%
rather vague definition
 
06:43:27.590 --> 06:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
of what these processes must look like
 
06:43:29.750 --> 06:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
along with harsh penalties for School
 
06:43:32.030 --> 06:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
Employees found in violation while some
 
06:43:33.288 --> 06:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
school districts could foreseeably
 
06:43:34.970 --> 06:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
benefit from improving these processes
 
06:43:37.310 --> 06:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
the solution should be made at the local
 
06:43:39.650 --> 06:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
level and not through a vague top-down
 
06:43:41.270 --> 06:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
mandate in the state legislature about
 
06:43:42.530 --> 06:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
what this process would include
 
06:43:44.628 --> 06:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
especially when such a mandate carries
 
06:43:46.070 --> 06:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
heavy punishments for those found in
 
06:43:46.080 --> 06:43:47.990 align:start position:0%
heavy punishments for those found in
violation

06:43:47.990 --> 06:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
violation
 
06:43:50.208 --> 06:43:50.218 align:start position:0%
we need muscles okay you're in wrap up
 
06:43:51.650 --> 06:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
territory you've got about 15 seconds
 
06:43:53.510 --> 06:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay we must be careful to treat our
 
06:43:54.890 --> 06:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
state's young students as people with
 
06:43:56.930 --> 06:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
their own agency and needs not as pawns
 
06:43:58.128 --> 06:43:58.138 align:start position:0%
and some made up conflict between
 
06:44:00.708 --> 06:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
parents and the world ultimately our
 
06:44:01.970 --> 06:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
movements members see this bill as
 
06:44:04.368 --> 06:44:04.378 align:start position:0%
unnecessary as an unnecessary piece of
 
06:44:05.930 --> 06:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
legislation that would create animosity
 
06:44:07.850 --> 06:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
between parents and Educators where none
 
06:44:09.830 --> 06:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
need exists all while disregarding the
 
06:44:10.910 --> 06:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
needs of the very people in the
 
06:44:12.470 --> 06:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's educational system must
 
06:44:15.890 --> 06:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
serve thank you very much and now we
 
06:44:18.288 --> 06:44:18.298 align:start position:0%
call Representative Potenza with Sean
 
06:44:35.208 --> 06:44:35.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:36.948 --> 06:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you chair my name is
 
06:44:38.868 --> 06:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly batenza of
 
06:44:40.850 --> 06:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
Stratford District 19.
 
06:44:44.208 --> 06:44:44.218 align:start position:0%
Rochester Wards one two three four and
 
06:44:44.218 --> 06:44:45.128 align:start position:0%
Rochester Wards one two three four and
six

06:44:45.128 --> 06:44:45.138 align:start position:0%
six
 
06:44:48.708 --> 06:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
the framework of opposition in this bill
 
06:44:51.770 --> 06:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
is all based upon the premise of abusive
 
06:44:55.250 --> 06:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
parents and where is the due process
 
06:44:57.350 --> 06:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's what's missing in all of this
 
06:44:59.150 --> 06:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
opposition testimony
 
06:45:01.610 --> 06:45:01.620 align:start position:0%
and I want to be clear about previous
 
06:45:05.270 --> 06:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
testimony here these are not new granted
 
06:45:08.990 --> 06:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
rights and I assume that the committee
 
06:45:10.190 --> 06:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
is going to do their homework and I'll
 
06:45:12.948 --> 06:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
make sure to send this testimony in as
 
06:45:12.958 --> 06:45:13.670 align:start position:0%
make sure to send this testimony in as
well

06:45:13.670 --> 06:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:45:17.090 --> 06:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
there's a long history which shows these
 
06:45:20.690 --> 06:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
rights that we already naturally have as
 
06:45:20.700 --> 06:45:22.368 align:start position:0%
rights that we already naturally have as
parents

06:45:22.368 --> 06:45:22.378 align:start position:0%
parents
 
06:45:26.090 --> 06:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
so going back to 1923 it is the natural
 
06:45:28.070 --> 06:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
duty of the parent to give his children
 
06:45:30.410 --> 06:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
education suitable to their station in
 
06:45:32.990 --> 06:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
life the fundamental theory of Liberty
 
06:45:34.910 --> 06:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
upon which all governments in this Union
 
06:45:37.548 --> 06:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
Repose excludes any general power of the
 
06:45:39.708 --> 06:45:39.718 align:start position:0%
state to standardize its children by
 
06:45:42.170 --> 06:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
forcing them to accept instruction from
 
06:45:44.810 --> 06:45:44.820 align:start position:0%
public teachers only the child is not
 
06:45:46.970 --> 06:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
the mere creature of the state those who
 
06:45:49.070 --> 06:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
nurture him and direct his Destiny have
 
06:45:51.470 --> 06:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
the right coupled with the high duty to
 
06:45:53.390 --> 06:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
recognize and prepare him for additional
 
06:45:55.430 --> 06:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
obligations that was pierce versus
 
06:45:58.250 --> 06:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
versus society sisters that was another
 
06:46:01.128 --> 06:46:01.138 align:start position:0%
these are all U.S Supreme Court cases
 
06:46:05.750 --> 06:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
going back from 1923 all the way up into
 
06:46:05.760 --> 06:46:08.270 align:start position:0%
going back from 1923 all the way up into
1997.

06:46:08.270 --> 06:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
1997.
 
06:46:10.250 --> 06:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
I do want to say
 
06:46:13.368 --> 06:46:13.378 align:start position:0%
um that I I do agree with there's been a
 
06:46:15.530 --> 06:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
couple testimony about that amendment
 
06:46:17.750 --> 06:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
being delivered at the last minute I
 
06:46:19.730 --> 06:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
don't like that either I don't think
 
06:46:21.350 --> 06:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
that that's transparent
 
06:46:24.770 --> 06:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
I support HB
 
06:46:24.780 --> 06:46:25.448 align:start position:0%
I support HB
um

06:46:25.448 --> 06:46:25.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:29.030 --> 06:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
hb10fn as introduced I do not support
 
06:46:32.750 --> 06:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment everything in here spells
 
06:46:34.730 --> 06:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
out the rights that we already have as
 
06:46:37.548 --> 06:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
parents to ask questions and I just want
 
06:46:39.110 --> 06:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
06:46:41.448 --> 06:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
um I could give lots of EX lots of
 
06:46:43.190 --> 06:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
examples but I won't because there's no
 
06:46:45.530 --> 06:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
time you've got 10 seconds to wrap it up
 
06:46:45.540 --> 06:46:46.968 align:start position:0%
time you've got 10 seconds to wrap it up
okay

06:46:46.968 --> 06:46:46.978 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:46:50.750 --> 06:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
um but these uh these these rights are
 
06:46:53.990 --> 06:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
are parents that want to be involved and
 
06:46:55.850 --> 06:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
they've probably had a roadblock that's
 
06:46:58.968 --> 06:46:58.978 align:start position:0%
happened to them so spelling out the
 
06:47:01.548 --> 06:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
right of getting information not about
 
06:47:01.558 --> 06:47:07.070 align:start position:0%
right of getting information not about
sexual

06:47:07.070 --> 06:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:09.530 --> 06:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much the chair recognizes

Seacoast outright
 
06:47:35.750 --> 06:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
I am deeply concerned about the ways
 
06:47:38.448 --> 06:47:38.458 align:start position:0%
this bill would Target and harm lgbtq
 
06:47:41.150 --> 06:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
students by restricting instruction on
 
06:47:43.548 --> 06:47:43.558 align:start position:0%
objectionable material HP 10 would
 
06:47:45.048 --> 06:47:45.058 align:start position:0%
intimidate teachers out of discussing
 
06:47:46.730 --> 06:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
lgbtq people
 
06:47:49.850 --> 06:47:49.860 align:start position:0%
and lgbtq issues it's invitation for
 
06:47:52.010 --> 06:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
scrutiny of instructional materials
 
06:47:53.810 --> 06:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
would only exacerbate the risk of
 
06:47:56.090 --> 06:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
discriminatory enforcement against lgbtq
 
06:47:56.100 --> 06:47:57.350 align:start position:0%
discriminatory enforcement against lgbtq
topics

06:47:57.350 --> 06:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
topics
 
06:47:59.628 --> 06:47:59.638 align:start position:0%
further with Provisions designed to
 
06:48:01.128 --> 06:48:01.138 align:start position:0%
force teachers to interfere in
 
06:48:03.830 --> 06:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
transgender students families hb10 would
 
06:48:05.750 --> 06:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
risk causing tremendous harm to
 
06:48:07.128 --> 06:48:07.138 align:start position:0%
vulnerable youth
 
06:48:08.810 --> 06:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
the moment of coming out to one's
 
06:48:10.850 --> 06:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
parents can have significant effects on
 
06:48:12.650 --> 06:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
a Young Person's mental health positive
 
06:48:14.810 --> 06:48:14.820 align:start position:0%
or negative depending on how it goes
 
06:48:17.330 --> 06:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
with the stakes so high it's important
 
06:48:19.548 --> 06:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
to empower schools to help youth prepare
 
06:48:22.190 --> 06:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
and come out when they're ready
 
06:48:24.590 --> 06:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
the last thing anyone needs is
 
06:48:27.110 --> 06:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
inflexible State mandated interference
 
06:48:29.510 --> 06:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
with that sensitive moment
 
06:48:31.128 --> 06:48:31.138 align:start position:0%
because of the frequent risk of harm
 
06:48:33.048 --> 06:48:33.058 align:start position:0%
from bills like this I worry that
 
06:48:34.730 --> 06:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
sometimes we lose sight of the important
 
06:48:37.310 --> 06:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
fact that lgbtq youth can Thrive when
 
06:48:39.948 --> 06:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
treated with dignity and respect
 
06:48:42.230 --> 06:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
coming out as LGBT in an affirming home
 
06:48:44.510 --> 06:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
can increase feelings of safety and
 
06:48:44.520 --> 06:48:45.890 align:start position:0%
can increase feelings of safety and
confidence

06:48:45.890 --> 06:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
confidence
 
06:48:48.230 --> 06:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
lgbtq students who feel supported by
 
06:48:50.150 --> 06:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
School staff get better grades are more
 
06:48:51.468 --> 06:48:51.478 align:start position:0%
likely to come to school and graduate
 
06:48:53.270 --> 06:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
and have a greater sense of belonging in
 
06:48:54.948 --> 06:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
their school communities and when
 
06:48:56.570 --> 06:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
transgender students receive the care
 
06:48:59.090 --> 06:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
they need they can succeed and Thrive at
 
06:49:00.948 --> 06:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
the same rates as their non-transgender
 
06:49:00.958 --> 06:49:02.510 align:start position:0%
the same rates as their non-transgender
peers

06:49:02.510 --> 06:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
peers
 
06:49:04.610 --> 06:49:04.620 align:start position:0%
this legislature took an important step
 
06:49:07.310 --> 06:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
toward protecting lgbtq youth in 2019
 
06:49:09.650 --> 06:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
with school non-discrimination law
 
06:49:12.590 --> 06:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
please reject today's attempt to reverse
 
06:49:16.850 --> 06:49:16.860 align:start position:0%

06:49:38.810 --> 06:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I apologize I don't have
 
06:49:39.948 --> 06:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
written testimony because of the
 
06:49:41.270 --> 06:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
amendment so we'll be submitting that
 
06:49:43.548 --> 06:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
once we can take a closer look at the
 
06:49:45.590 --> 06:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
language so I'll keep my comments um
 
06:49:48.048 --> 06:49:48.058 align:start position:0%
somewhat high level
 
06:49:50.150 --> 06:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
um so from hearing the the amendment
 
06:49:52.250 --> 06:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
outlined by the uh sponsor it sounds
 
06:49:54.230 --> 06:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
like now we're much closer to the Senate
 
06:49:55.910 --> 06:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
version of this bill uh which we have
 
06:49:58.548 --> 06:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
serious problems with uh many of the
 
06:50:00.170 --> 06:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
kind of railroad concerns and how this
 
06:50:02.990 --> 06:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
is really going to harm uh lgbtq
 
06:50:05.390 --> 06:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
especially trans youth um in New
 
06:50:08.090 --> 06:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have already been articulated
 
06:50:10.190 --> 06:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
um quite strongly by others
 
06:50:12.288 --> 06:50:12.298 align:start position:0%
um I'll focus on a few things that have
 
06:50:14.810 --> 06:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
not been lifted up so far
 
06:50:17.030 --> 06:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
and you know because of the the
 
06:50:19.430 --> 06:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to the new language around uh
 
06:50:22.368 --> 06:50:22.378 align:start position:0%
really trying to focus on lgbtq youth in
 
06:50:24.650 --> 06:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
particularly trans youth in particular
 
06:50:26.750 --> 06:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
we're really creating a special tier of
 
06:50:29.628 --> 06:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
surveillance in schools for Trans youth
 
06:50:32.150 --> 06:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh which violates privacy rights and
 
06:50:35.448 --> 06:50:35.458 align:start position:0%
also sets um New Hampshire up for
 
06:50:37.730 --> 06:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
potential violations of
 
06:50:40.430 --> 06:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
of federal law and so to give an example
 
06:50:42.288 --> 06:50:42.298 align:start position:0%
U.S department of education's office of
 
06:50:43.788 --> 06:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
civil rights issued a notice of
 
06:50:45.468 --> 06:50:45.478 align:start position:0%
interpretation explaining how it would
 
06:50:47.810 --> 06:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
enforce Title IX prohibition on
 
06:50:50.030 --> 06:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination on the basis of sex to
 
06:50:50.040 --> 06:50:50.990 align:start position:0%
discrimination on the basis of sex to
include

06:50:50.990 --> 06:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
include
 
06:50:52.670 --> 06:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on sexual
 
06:50:55.070 --> 06:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
orientation and discrimination based on
 
06:50:56.750 --> 06:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
gender identity and so when you're
 
06:50:58.070 --> 06:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the new language of the
 
06:50:58.080 --> 06:50:59.750 align:start position:0%
looking at the new language of the
amendments

06:50:59.750 --> 06:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
06:51:02.570 --> 06:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
um uh as written transgender youth are
 
06:51:04.310 --> 06:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
subjected to a distinct level of
 
06:51:06.708 --> 06:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
surveillance in schools and we think
 
06:51:08.390 --> 06:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
that is a serious concern that you all
 
06:51:11.830 --> 06:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
should be looking into more seriously
 
06:51:14.628 --> 06:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
and I just want to flag one other issue
 
06:51:17.208 --> 06:51:17.218 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been lifted up uh is that
 
06:51:19.128 --> 06:51:19.138 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Education is
 
06:51:20.690 --> 06:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
currently invested pretty pretty heavily
 
06:51:23.030 --> 06:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the one trusted adult program and
 
06:51:24.770 --> 06:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
this bill would really undermine that
 
06:51:26.330 --> 06:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
work you know that program is really
 
06:51:28.968 --> 06:51:28.978 align:start position:0%
about ensuring that students know that
 
06:51:31.070 --> 06:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
they have a trusted person at the school
 
06:51:33.468 --> 06:51:33.478 align:start position:0%
who they can confide in and what this
 
06:51:35.030 --> 06:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
bill would do would be to gut that
 
06:51:37.128 --> 06:51:37.138 align:start position:0%
program so we hope that you all will
 
06:51:39.530 --> 06:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
consider italying this bill and have to
 
06:51:42.590 --> 06:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:44.990 --> 06:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you so much chair
 
06:51:48.948 --> 06:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
recognizes Aaron George Kelly with Betsy
 
06:51:52.610 --> 06:51:52.620 align:start position:0%
Harrington up next
 
06:51:54.708 --> 06:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman and committee
 
06:51:56.690 --> 06:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
members thank you for the opportunity to
 
06:51:58.670 --> 06:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
speak to you today my name is Aaron
 
06:52:00.770 --> 06:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
George Kelly and I'm the director of
 
06:52:02.390 --> 06:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
homeless Youth and Young Adult Services
 
06:52:05.090 --> 06:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
for Waypoint I have come to express
 
06:52:08.510 --> 06:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
waypoint's opposition of house bill 10.
 
06:52:10.968 --> 06:52:10.978 align:start position:0%
I've worked with youth and families in
 
06:52:13.368 --> 06:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for over 20 years and in
 
06:52:14.868 --> 06:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
homeless Youth and Young Adult Services
 
06:52:18.230 --> 06:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
in our state for over 15 years I have
 
06:52:20.510 --> 06:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
seen firsthand that Educators and School
 
06:52:23.208 --> 06:52:23.218 align:start position:0%
staff members are often the safest
 
06:52:25.030 --> 06:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
adults in a young person's life
 
06:52:29.208 --> 06:52:29.218 align:start position:0%
especially youth who identify as lgbtq
 
06:52:31.850 --> 06:52:31.860 align:start position:0%
this legislation targets these exact
 
06:52:37.310 --> 06:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
people Educators and lgbtq Youth parents
 
06:52:39.708 --> 06:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
rights may seem like common sense but
 
06:52:41.628 --> 06:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
when you look behind the curtain these
 
06:52:44.150 --> 06:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
terms are used to strip teenagers of
 
06:52:46.730 --> 06:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
their basic rights to education physical
 
06:52:50.690 --> 06:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
safety and freedom this bill unfairly
 
06:52:53.750 --> 06:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
stigmatizes lgbtq students because their
 
06:52:56.390 --> 06:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
Journey will be policed and reported
 
06:52:59.510 --> 06:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
back to their parents teenagers are at a
 
06:53:01.070 --> 06:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
crucial stage of development and
 
06:53:02.930 --> 06:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
beginning to establish some independence
 
06:53:05.208 --> 06:53:05.218 align:start position:0%
from their parents and figuring out who
 
06:53:08.030 --> 06:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
they are all students deserve to feel
 
06:53:10.190 --> 06:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
safe in school they should be able to
 
06:53:12.890 --> 06:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
trust staff members to support them and
 
06:53:14.510 --> 06:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
not surveil them
 
06:53:16.548 --> 06:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
this does not mean hiding information
 
06:53:19.250 --> 06:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
from parents this means the
 
06:53:21.170 --> 06:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
appropriately trained School staff
 
06:53:23.868 --> 06:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
allowing youth to be experts in their
 
06:53:26.270 --> 06:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
own lives and share with parents when
 
06:53:30.530 --> 06:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
they are ready and able to do so safely
 
06:53:33.830 --> 06:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
the Trevor projects 2022 National survey
 
06:53:36.368 --> 06:53:36.378 align:start position:0%
on lgbtq Mental Health in New Hampshire
 
06:53:41.570 --> 06:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
states that 39 of lgbtq in our state
 
06:53:44.270 --> 06:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
have considered suicide and 10 percent
 
06:53:46.850 --> 06:53:46.860 align:start position:0%
of them have made at least one attempt
 
06:53:48.948 --> 06:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
in the last year
 
06:53:52.548 --> 06:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
forcing lgbtq youth to be outed is not
 
06:53:55.070 --> 06:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
just harmful it could lead to increased
 
06:53:57.830 --> 06:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
suicide attempts and death
 
06:54:00.708 --> 06:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
this same survey tells us that 44
 
06:54:03.730 --> 06:54:03.740 align:start position:0%
percent of New Hampshire's lgbtq youth
 
06:54:07.910 --> 06:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
identify home as not being an lgbtq
 
06:54:10.010 --> 06:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
affirming space
 
06:54:13.368 --> 06:54:13.378 align:start position:0%
got about 15 seconds to wrap it up you
 
06:54:15.410 --> 06:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
may assume that establishing a parent's
 
06:54:17.628 --> 06:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
right Bill of Rights means connecting
 
06:54:19.850 --> 06:54:19.860 align:start position:0%
loving caring and supportive parents
 
06:54:21.708 --> 06:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
with what is occurring in children's
 
06:54:24.650 --> 06:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
educational setting that is not the
 
06:54:27.170 --> 06:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
reality and we know that firsthand at
 
06:54:30.170 --> 06:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
Waypoint because 25 of the Youth and

I worked as a dcyf investigator and as a
 
06:54:59.990 --> 06:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
state at the state prison as a sex
 
06:55:02.448 --> 06:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
offender counselor in my work I have
 
06:55:04.070 --> 06:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
never had to remove a child from a

parent rejecting their gender or
 
06:55:08.330 --> 06:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
sexuality I know it's happened but it's
 
06:55:10.190 --> 06:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
very uncommon I have had Parents
 
06:55:11.628 --> 06:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
struggle with the news of their kids
 
06:55:13.368 --> 06:55:13.378 align:start position:0%
coming out but I have never had a parent
 
06:55:15.708 --> 06:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
reject a child or beat a child for their
 
06:55:15.718 --> 06:55:16.730 align:start position:0%
reject a child or beat a child for their
differences

06:55:16.730 --> 06:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
differences
 
06:55:18.948 --> 06:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
abuse usually had to do with the parents
 
06:55:21.830 --> 06:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
issues often drug or alcohol related I
 
06:55:23.510 --> 06:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
have worked with sex offenders and I
 
06:55:25.430 --> 06:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
know intimately of their plots to abuse
 
06:55:25.440 --> 06:55:26.690 align:start position:0%
know intimately of their plots to abuse
children

06:55:26.690 --> 06:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:55:28.968 --> 06:55:28.978 align:start position:0%
they found the loopholes they became
 
06:55:31.010 --> 06:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
teachers Camp counselors and coaches
 
06:55:32.868 --> 06:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
they found a way to get close to
 
06:55:35.628 --> 06:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
children and to be trusted predators are
 
06:55:37.610 --> 06:55:37.620 align:start position:0%
surrounding our children and parents are
 
06:55:39.288 --> 06:55:39.298 align:start position:0%
the ultimate protectors to their
 
06:55:41.390 --> 06:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
children teachers can be a wonderful
 
06:55:44.090 --> 06:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
resource to our kids but they are 180
 
06:55:46.910 --> 06:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
day resource maybe as much as four years
 
06:55:49.310 --> 06:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
but they ultimately abandoned their

but they ultimately abandoned their
students

06:55:50.208 --> 06:55:50.218 align:start position:0%
students
 
06:55:52.548 --> 06:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
parents are forever and we house our
 
06:55:54.770 --> 06:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
children not the school staff if you
 
06:55:55.968 --> 06:55:55.978 align:start position:0%
support secrets and special
 
06:55:58.070 --> 06:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
relationships it damages the child
 
06:56:00.410 --> 06:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
parent relationship you cut off this
 
06:56:02.270 --> 06:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
child from the only people responsible
 
06:56:05.270 --> 06:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
for caring for them until adulthood if
 
06:56:07.490 --> 06:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
you allow secrets you will have good
 
06:56:09.288 --> 06:56:09.298 align:start position:0%
parents removing our highest testing
 
06:56:10.850 --> 06:56:10.860 align:start position:0%
students for a safer educational

I'm ready to go I see the dangers and
 
06:56:19.548 --> 06:56:19.558 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I can allow my kids to be
 
06:56:21.948 --> 06:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
put at risk anymore our public schools
 
06:56:24.048 --> 06:56:24.058 align:start position:0%
are Distributing exploitive porn through
 
06:56:25.968 --> 06:56:25.978 align:start position:0%
our libraries and hiding secrets from
 
06:56:28.368 --> 06:56:28.378 align:start position:0%
parents why would any decent parents
 
06:56:31.010 --> 06:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
sign their kids up for that I'm ready to
 
06:56:33.468 --> 06:56:33.478 align:start position:0%
leave we will all soon be paying taxes
 
06:56:36.350 --> 06:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
to say State sanctioned abuse I pay a
 
06:56:38.030 --> 06:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month to property
 
06:56:40.250 --> 06:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
taxes I'd like that to cover a safe
 
06:56:42.708 --> 06:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
education for my kids otherwise why
 
06:56:44.510 --> 06:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
would I want to pay such high taxes for
 
06:56:46.850 --> 06:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
something that's too dangerous to use if
 
06:56:49.128 --> 06:56:49.138 align:start position:0%
I ask my son's teacher a question about
 
06:56:51.170 --> 06:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
my son I expect the truth or I won't
 
06:56:53.270 --> 06:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
trust that teacher with my kids 15
 
06:56:55.850 --> 06:56:55.860 align:start position:0%

good afternoon my name is Jama Wilder
 
06:57:15.368 --> 06:57:15.378 align:start position:0%
and I'm the parent of five children
 
06:57:19.490 --> 06:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
Aging in or arranging in ages from 4 to
 
06:57:21.288 --> 06:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
18 years old
 
06:57:24.288 --> 06:57:24.298 align:start position:0%
over a year ago I was denied my request
 
06:57:26.690 --> 06:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
for a public hearing for my District
 
06:57:29.570 --> 06:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
School Board I wanted the opportunity to
 
06:57:32.030 --> 06:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
share with parents the things that were
 
06:57:34.190 --> 06:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
going on in our district
 
06:57:36.350 --> 06:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
my children's curriculum was riddled
 
06:57:39.048 --> 06:57:39.058 align:start position:0%
with inappropriate sexual content many
 
06:57:41.270 --> 06:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
subjects were presented with divisive
 
06:57:44.090 --> 06:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
Concepts that left my children confused
 
06:57:46.430 --> 06:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
and questioning why the information was
 
06:57:48.730 --> 06:57:48.740 align:start position:0%
being presented
 
06:57:51.288 --> 06:57:51.298 align:start position:0%
I have the opportunity to speak to my
 
06:57:53.810 --> 06:57:53.820 align:start position:0%
children on multiple occasions and they
 
06:57:56.030 --> 06:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
came to me and they told me it was there
 
06:57:57.890 --> 06:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
the school district said that it was
 
06:58:00.230 --> 06:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
posted on their Google classrooms but
 
06:58:03.288 --> 06:58:03.298 align:start position:0%
the teachers weren't uploading it so
 
06:58:06.530 --> 06:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
what they said was transparency never
 
06:58:09.170 --> 06:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
existed at all and I know from my
 
06:58:10.730 --> 06:58:10.740 align:start position:0%
children telling me
 
06:58:12.468 --> 06:58:12.478 align:start position:0%
I grew up in Hollis and went through
 
06:58:14.448 --> 06:58:14.458 align:start position:0%
preschool through graduation of the high
 
06:58:16.968 --> 06:58:16.978 align:start position:0%
school there and it is a very different
 
06:58:19.730 --> 06:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
place today since I moved back to town
 
06:58:21.530 --> 06:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
there have been two suicides in our
 
06:58:24.230 --> 06:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
district the most recent suicide took
 
06:58:26.090 --> 06:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
place one week after the school
 
06:58:29.330 --> 06:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
illegally gave the children the youth
 
06:58:31.730 --> 06:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
risk assessment survey they never gave
 
06:58:34.070 --> 06:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
us the option to opt out and when the
 
06:58:35.868 --> 06:58:35.878 align:start position:0%
state gave them a slap on the wrist
 
06:58:38.868 --> 06:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
because they had broken the law they
 
06:58:40.250 --> 06:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
simply said that they were destroying
 
06:58:42.048 --> 06:58:42.058 align:start position:0%
the surveys they never gave it to the
 
06:58:43.610 --> 06:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
parents or showed them what those
 
06:58:46.070 --> 06:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
questions were asking their children
 
06:58:48.650 --> 06:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
the school is incorporating toxic ideas
 
06:58:51.048 --> 06:58:51.058 align:start position:0%
they present as helpful through their
 
06:58:53.750 --> 06:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning programs the
 
06:58:55.730 --> 06:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
mental health of these children is
 
06:58:58.968 --> 06:58:58.978 align:start position:0%
plummeting and instead of pausing and
 
06:59:00.948 --> 06:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
looking at what harm they're doing to
 
06:59:03.410 --> 06:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
continue to make it harder and harder
 
06:59:06.350 --> 06:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
for parents to be involved if they don't
 
06:59:09.288 --> 06:59:09.298 align:start position:0%
agree with this the last day that my
 
06:59:11.448 --> 06:59:11.458 align:start position:0%
children attended Public School my
 
06:59:13.490 --> 06:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
daughter was denied the right to present
 
06:59:16.310 --> 06:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
a project because the teacher told her
 
06:59:19.190 --> 06:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
it was argumentative it was a PowerPoint
 
06:59:23.090 --> 06:59:23.100 align:start position:0%
presentation with six or seven slides 15
 
06:59:25.910 --> 06:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
seconds to go she used a direct quote
 
06:59:29.048 --> 06:59:29.058 align:start position:0%
and she gave what her interpretation was
 
06:59:32.208 --> 06:59:32.218 align:start position:0%
from the first president of the teachers
 
06:59:34.670 --> 06:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
union John Dewey since my daughter's
 
06:59:36.530 --> 06:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
views did not align with the narrative
 
06:59:38.510 --> 06:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
she was told she would have to redo the
 
06:59:41.150 --> 06:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
project and only use biography.com for
 
06:59:43.548 --> 06:59:43.558 align:start position:0%
her research they did not question the
 
06:59:46.610 --> 06:59:46.620 align:start position:0%
direct quote but she was silenced many
 
06:59:49.010 --> 06:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
times my my children expressed their
 
06:59:51.468 --> 06:59:51.478 align:start position:0%
fears and inabilities to share their
 
06:59:53.990 --> 06:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts for fear of persecution thank
 
06:59:55.968 --> 06:59:55.978 align:start position:0%
you and that will end your testimony we
 
06:59:57.708 --> 06:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you gave us for about
 
07:00:00.170 --> 07:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
two minutes and 20 seconds next the
 
07:00:03.530 --> 07:00:03.540 align:start position:0%

07:00:13.548 --> 07:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:16.070 --> 07:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Lynn's Jake
 
07:00:18.430 --> 07:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
house and you see them pronounced
 
07:00:20.628 --> 07:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
three equality
 
07:00:22.548 --> 07:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
I I would like to State for the record
 
07:00:24.170 --> 07:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
that I also opposed a senate side
 
07:00:26.628 --> 07:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
version of this bill and I oppose HB set
 
07:00:28.730 --> 07:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
10. this bill would established a path
 
07:00:30.170 --> 07:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
toward discipline for any School
 
07:00:32.390 --> 07:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
employee who encourages or courses or
 
07:00:34.548 --> 07:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
attempts to encourage your coerce a
 
07:00:36.230 --> 07:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
minor child to withhold information from
 
07:00:38.510 --> 07:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
his or her parent no educator should
 
07:00:41.150 --> 07:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
ever coerce students period however many
 
07:00:43.070 --> 07:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
conversations between a student and
 
07:00:45.170 --> 07:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
trusted teacher or other School employee
 
07:00:47.208 --> 07:00:47.218 align:start position:0%
might look like this the student says
 
07:00:49.490 --> 07:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
I'm gay or I'm trans or I think I might
 
07:00:51.708 --> 07:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
be bi the teacher says thank you for
 
07:00:53.270 --> 07:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
telling me have you told your parents
 
07:00:55.250 --> 07:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
the student says I don't feel safe doing
 
07:00:57.350 --> 07:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
that I know my parents believe being gay
 
07:00:59.390 --> 07:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
or trans is wrong or I'm not sure if I'm
 
07:01:01.730 --> 07:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
ready for that conversation yet the
 
07:01:03.830 --> 07:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
teacher says it's okay to not be sure or
 
07:01:05.090 --> 07:01:05.100 align:start position:0%
it's okay to come out on your own
 
07:01:07.548 --> 07:01:07.558 align:start position:0%
timeline that's how my conversation with
 
07:01:08.868 --> 07:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
my favorite High School teacher went
 
07:01:10.490 --> 07:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
when I knew it wasn't safe to come out
 
07:01:13.310 --> 07:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
to my father who believes being lgbtq is
 
07:01:15.830 --> 07:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
a sin I can easily see how many people
 
07:01:17.570 --> 07:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
who fear Monger against trans people
 
07:01:19.310 --> 07:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
would try to say that a teacher is
 
07:01:20.750 --> 07:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
encouraging a student under those
 
07:01:22.850 --> 07:01:22.860 align:start position:0%
circumstances even though it's a simple
 
07:01:24.890 --> 07:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
neutral response that lets a student who
 
07:01:26.150 --> 07:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
knows their family better than any
 
07:01:28.010 --> 07:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
teacher think through their own coming
 
07:01:30.110 --> 07:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
out timeline it is not clear how
 
07:01:32.628 --> 07:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
encourage is defined or interpreted when
 
07:01:34.310 --> 07:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
my father did find out I had feelings
 
07:01:35.690 --> 07:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
for my best friend and that we would
 
07:01:37.548 --> 07:01:37.558 align:start position:0%
kiss sometimes by hacking into my
 
07:01:39.110 --> 07:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
personal internet accounts he told me
 
07:01:41.390 --> 07:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
homosexuality was disgusting and immoral
 
07:01:43.548 --> 07:01:43.558 align:start position:0%
and not how I was raised took away my
 
07:01:45.288 --> 07:01:45.298 align:start position:0%
phone and I thought I might be sent to
 
07:01:47.510 --> 07:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy I was limited to
 
07:01:49.010 --> 07:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
applying only to colleges that
 
07:01:50.930 --> 07:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
specifically did not affirm lgbtq
 
07:01:53.390 --> 07:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
students he Gaslight me by telling me I
 
07:01:55.490 --> 07:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
wasn't queer just confused constantly
 
07:01:57.350 --> 07:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
criticized and shamed me to the point of
 
07:01:59.270 --> 07:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
only talking about me like my true self
 
07:02:01.368 --> 07:02:01.378 align:start position:0%
was an entirely different person and
 
07:02:02.930 --> 07:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
that I was only worthy of love if I
 
07:02:04.968 --> 07:02:04.978 align:start position:0%
adhered exactly to his worldview and
 
07:02:06.770 --> 07:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
telling me that I was so immoral that he
 
07:02:08.330 --> 07:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
was concerned for the state of my soul
 
07:02:10.670 --> 07:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
this never changed continuing into
 
07:02:12.770 --> 07:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
adulthood these are also the reasons
 
07:02:14.570 --> 07:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
that I gradually came out to a few close
 
07:02:15.890 --> 07:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
friends and teachers at my high school
 
07:02:17.570 --> 07:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
because I desperately needed the few
 
07:02:19.788 --> 07:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
people I trusted too I've got 15 seconds
 
07:02:22.070 --> 07:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
to finish up to wrap up I'm also
 
07:02:23.510 --> 07:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about the line that requires
 
07:02:24.830 --> 07:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
parental consent for Health Care
 
07:02:26.270 --> 07:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
practitioners does this include
 
07:02:27.590 --> 07:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
school-based Behavioral Health
 
07:02:29.208 --> 07:02:29.218 align:start position:0%
Counselors if so that's cutting off
 
07:02:32.150 --> 07:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
another Lifeline for lgbtq kids like my
 
07:02:33.948 --> 07:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
younger self whose parents deny any need
 
07:02:37.610 --> 07:02:37.620 align:start position:0%

again when I had stepped out of the room
 
07:02:52.368 --> 07:02:52.378 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate that um so my name is
 
07:02:53.750 --> 07:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
Heather Mullins I have a 13 year old
 
07:02:53.760 --> 07:02:54.530 align:start position:0%
Heather Mullins I have a 13 year old
daughter

07:02:54.530 --> 07:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
07:02:55.788 --> 07:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
um I'll tell you right now like I would
 
07:02:57.530 --> 07:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
take a bullet for my child and I think
 
07:02:59.030 --> 07:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'm probably one of the only people in
 
07:03:01.368 --> 07:03:01.378 align:start position:0%
the in the room that would and so while
 
07:03:03.468 --> 07:03:03.478 align:start position:0%
I hear her stories about parents having
 
07:03:05.570 --> 07:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
abused their child like I guarantee you
 
07:03:07.430 --> 07:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
the majority of parents are the biggest
 
07:03:09.170 --> 07:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
Protectors of their children every
 
07:03:10.968 --> 07:03:10.978 align:start position:0%
single one of you up there can probably
 
07:03:13.010 --> 07:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
say that your children you would do
 
07:03:15.410 --> 07:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
anything for and you can't give away my
 
07:03:17.030 --> 07:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
rights as a parent without giving away
 
07:03:19.070 --> 07:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
your own so if at some point in time
 
07:03:20.750 --> 07:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
you're not sitting behind that bench and
 
07:03:22.850 --> 07:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
you're a parent just like me and you
 
07:03:24.530 --> 07:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
disagree with Allah or something that
 
07:03:26.510 --> 07:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
gets passed you want that being pushed
 
07:03:28.368 --> 07:03:28.378 align:start position:0%
on your children a lot of what I'm
 
07:03:30.650 --> 07:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
hearing with this lgbtq stuff as being
 
07:03:32.750 --> 07:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
like sort of the prerequisite to remove
 
07:03:35.410 --> 07:03:35.420 align:start position:0%
parents rights is really like a
 
07:03:38.330 --> 07:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
fundamental lifestyle choice right the
 
07:03:40.610 --> 07:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
idea that a child is going to get abused
 
07:03:42.288 --> 07:03:42.298 align:start position:0%
if they have let's say a Christian or
 
07:03:44.628 --> 07:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
Catholic family because they disagree
 
07:03:46.610 --> 07:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
with you know pronouns or things of that
 
07:03:48.830 --> 07:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
nature it's just ludicrous right like
 
07:03:50.448 --> 07:03:50.458 align:start position:0%
most parents even if they don't agree
 
07:03:52.128 --> 07:03:52.138 align:start position:0%
with changing their child's pronoun
 
07:03:53.330 --> 07:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
they'll be like you know what you want
 
07:03:54.288 --> 07:03:54.298 align:start position:0%
to change your name you want to change
 
07:03:56.150 --> 07:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
your pronouns when you're 18 you're not
 
07:03:57.708 --> 07:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
under my roof do it they're not going to
 
07:04:00.708 --> 07:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
beat their child for for having like
 
07:04:03.110 --> 07:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
these peer groups at school and the
 
07:04:04.610 --> 07:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
other thing that I want to point out is
 
07:04:06.048 --> 07:04:06.058 align:start position:0%
that there's actually a group called
 
07:04:07.910 --> 07:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
gaze against groomers and there's ones
 
07:04:09.650 --> 07:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
called the changed movement which are
 
07:04:13.070 --> 07:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
lgbtq former lgbtq that that have gone
 
07:04:14.690 --> 07:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
through transitions including a
 
07:04:16.850 --> 07:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
gentleman behind me who is is living
 
07:04:19.070 --> 07:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
proof that some of these ideologies
 
07:04:21.410 --> 07:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
they're pushing on kids whose brains
 
07:04:23.570 --> 07:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
haven't fully developed have lifelong
 
07:04:25.548 --> 07:04:25.558 align:start position:0%
irreversible consequences that are
 
07:04:27.890 --> 07:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
life-threatening and so I appreciate
 
07:04:29.868 --> 07:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
everyone caring about children but
 
07:04:31.670 --> 07:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
there's two sides of this equation and
 
07:04:34.070 --> 07:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
two sides of this conversation but on a
 
07:04:36.110 --> 07:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
national media standpoint only one
 
07:04:38.330 --> 07:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
narrative is being allowed to get talked
 
07:04:40.730 --> 07:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
about and it's actually within the lgbtq
 
07:04:43.010 --> 07:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
community it's frowned upon to
 
07:04:45.170 --> 07:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
de-transition or to say you know what
 
07:04:48.110 --> 07:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
I'm more suicidal post-operate Nation we
 
07:04:50.270 --> 07:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
really need to say the kids genuinely
 
07:04:52.730 --> 07:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
suffering from gender dysphoria when
 
07:04:55.010 --> 07:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
they are 18 and older if they want to
 
07:04:57.230 --> 07:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
make that decision that is on them but
 
07:05:00.110 --> 07:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
to take our children and use this lgbtq
 
07:05:03.530 --> 07:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
stuff as an excuse to remove parents
 
07:05:05.390 --> 07:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
from having a seat at the table for
 
07:05:07.368 --> 07:05:07.378 align:start position:0%
what's best for their kids to me it's
 
07:05:10.070 --> 07:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
just it's horrifying as a mom thank
 
07:05:12.410 --> 07:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you so much we left you go a
 
07:05:15.048 --> 07:05:15.058 align:start position:0%
couple of well about 15 seconds over
 
07:05:16.910 --> 07:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
07:05:21.770 --> 07:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
next we call Holly Stevens from Nami and
 
07:05:24.830 --> 07:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
um after that Brian blaketon blackton
 
07:05:41.390 --> 07:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:43.548 --> 07:05:43.558 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Pearson members
 
07:05:45.650 --> 07:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Holly
 
07:05:47.090 --> 07:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
Stevens and I'm the director of public
 
07:05:50.448 --> 07:05:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:52.310 --> 07:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
now I mean New Hampshire is a non-profit
 
07:05:53.990 --> 07:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
Grassroots organization whose mission is
 
07:05:55.430 --> 07:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
to improve the lives of all people
 
07:05:57.610 --> 07:05:57.620 align:start position:0%
impacted by mental illness and suicide
 
07:06:00.468 --> 07:06:00.478 align:start position:0%
we are here today in opposition to house
 
07:06:03.830 --> 07:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
bill 10. I did notice as I think some
 
07:06:05.690 --> 07:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
folks had mentioned the date on the
 
07:06:08.510 --> 07:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is March 1st and being in a
 
07:06:10.368 --> 07:06:10.378 align:start position:0%
small non-profit with limited resources
 
07:06:12.230 --> 07:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
it would have been really helpful if we
 
07:06:14.570 --> 07:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
were able to have we would have liked to
 
07:06:16.730 --> 07:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
have had it too there was some glitches
 
07:06:18.708 --> 07:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
not of our doing can you take that off
 
07:06:25.548 --> 07:06:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:29.990 --> 07:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:31.850 --> 07:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
but is it just going back to that it
 
07:06:33.048 --> 07:06:33.058 align:start position:0%
would have been helpful to have it
 
07:06:35.750 --> 07:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
before the start of the hearing today I
 
07:06:37.730 --> 07:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
heard from uh
 
07:06:37.740 --> 07:06:38.810 align:start position:0%
heard from uh
speaker

07:06:38.810 --> 07:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
07:06:40.910 --> 07:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
Sherman Packard mentioned that this this
 
07:06:42.948 --> 07:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
has been in the works for a while
 
07:06:45.650 --> 07:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
um also when he was bringing uh the bill
 
07:06:48.170 --> 07:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
uh to the committee my written testimony
 
07:06:50.150 --> 07:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
may not seem as relevant now as the bill
 
07:06:51.890 --> 07:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
has changed I will send my written
 
07:06:54.230 --> 07:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
testimony on Senate Bill 272 to the
 
07:06:56.270 --> 07:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
committee since it seems similar to the
 
07:06:58.190 --> 07:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
amendment but even though my original
 
07:07:00.410 --> 07:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
written testimony may not seem relevant
 
07:07:03.048 --> 07:07:03.058 align:start position:0%
to this amendment it is we are in the
 
07:07:04.490 --> 07:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
middle of a Children's Mental Health
 
07:07:07.548 --> 07:07:07.558 align:start position:0%
crisis and we need all hands on deck we
 
07:07:09.890 --> 07:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
need to come together and neither the
 
07:07:11.628 --> 07:07:11.638 align:start position:0%
original Bill nor the amendment will
 
07:07:14.090 --> 07:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
accomplish this goal the bill and the
 
07:07:16.430 --> 07:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
amendment Amendment destroy the trusted
 
07:07:18.230 --> 07:07:18.240 align:start position:0%

07:07:20.628 --> 07:07:20.638 align:start position:0%

07:07:38.150 --> 07:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
perceived divide between parents and
 
07:07:40.430 --> 07:07:40.440 align:start position:0%

because I remember when the Twin Towers

were hit I was teaching seventh grade

English class
 
07:09:20.090 --> 07:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
some may assume I took the opportunity
 
07:09:22.490 --> 07:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
to try to indoctrinate my students to my
 
07:09:24.890 --> 07:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
beliefs that day but I only taught the
 
07:09:26.390 --> 07:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
daily curriculum
 
07:09:28.910 --> 07:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
I firmly believe parents are in charge
 
07:09:31.310 --> 07:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
of their children's education not
 
07:09:33.170 --> 07:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
indoctrinated to another person's

direction that was attempted to me thank

God not to today's levels but my

children's were exposed to it at today's
levels

levels
 
07:09:43.910 --> 07:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
I do not believe any school has the
 
07:09:46.490 --> 07:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
power or right to not inform parents of
 
07:09:48.288 --> 07:09:48.298 align:start position:0%
any aspect of their childhood education
 
07:09:51.110 --> 07:09:51.120 align:start position:0%

07:09:56.150 --> 07:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
them that is a parent's job and a
 
07:09:58.070 --> 07:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
parent's right
 
07:10:00.890 --> 07:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
by taking God out of school this is part
 
07:10:03.230 --> 07:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
of the outcome I think the way to fix
 
07:10:05.390 --> 07:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
this is to remove children from public
 
07:10:05.400 --> 07:10:06.590 align:start position:0%
this is to remove children from public
school

07:10:06.590 --> 07:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
school
 
07:10:08.990 --> 07:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
until the parents are heard if this bill
 
07:10:14.690 --> 07:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:16.930 --> 07:10:16.940 align:start position:0%
and the chair
 
07:10:20.810 --> 07:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
recognizes Brian Hawkins with Stephen
 
07:10:24.110 --> 07:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
scare up Beyond
 
07:10:24.120 --> 07:10:36.850 align:start position:0%
scare up Beyond
him

07:10:36.850 --> 07:10:36.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:53.110 --> 07:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:55.250 --> 07:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
07:10:58.250 --> 07:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
Brian Hawkins uh representing Nea New
 
07:11:00.288 --> 07:11:00.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today we represent more than
 
07:11:02.570 --> 07:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
17 000 Educators across the state
 
07:11:04.310 --> 07:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
including many of the local education
 
07:11:08.208 --> 07:11:08.218 align:start position:0%
associations uh for many that are in
 
07:11:10.548 --> 07:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
many of your districts
 
07:11:12.890 --> 07:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
um and I am here to testify in
 
07:11:16.128 --> 07:11:16.138 align:start position:0%
opposition to hospital 10 today and I
 
07:11:18.288 --> 07:11:18.298 align:start position:0%
will try to hit just the points that I I
 
07:11:20.390 --> 07:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
tried to see were the similarities
 
07:11:23.330 --> 07:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
between the original bill and the
 
07:11:26.030 --> 07:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and also not to repeat a lot
 
07:11:28.030 --> 07:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
of what has been said
 
07:11:30.590 --> 07:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
we have several concerns with this piece
 
07:11:33.288 --> 07:11:33.298 align:start position:0%
of legislation first and foremost
 
07:11:35.810 --> 07:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
included including the the stated
 
07:11:38.390 --> 07:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
penalties of the bill this is similar to
 
07:11:41.570 --> 07:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
our opposition of the bill last year uh
 
07:11:43.548 --> 07:11:43.558 align:start position:0%
which will actually take at least some
 
07:11:45.288 --> 07:11:45.298 align:start position:0%
of those were taken out when it made
 
07:11:48.590 --> 07:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
over to to the Senate uh
 
07:11:50.868 --> 07:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
um the some of the overbroad language
 
07:11:53.030 --> 07:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
that are tied to those violations
 
07:11:56.690 --> 07:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
as well as the numerous areas that um
 
07:11:59.448 --> 07:11:59.458 align:start position:0%
or at least duplicative or con or
 
07:12:03.288 --> 07:12:03.298 align:start position:0%
confusing uh so first with the penalties
 
07:12:04.968 --> 07:12:04.978 align:start position:0%
um the bill states that
 
07:12:06.830 --> 07:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
um any person who violates any provision
 
07:12:08.570 --> 07:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
of this chapter shall be guilty of a
 
07:12:12.048 --> 07:12:12.058 align:start position:0%
Class A misdemeanor violations of a bill
 
07:12:14.390 --> 07:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
such as this result resulting in
 
07:12:17.750 --> 07:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties are unacceptable I
 
07:12:20.170 --> 07:12:20.180 align:start position:0%
think especially as was
 
07:12:22.610 --> 07:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
noted earlier we were in an educator
 
07:12:25.070 --> 07:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
shortage we are desperately trying to
 
07:12:27.288 --> 07:12:27.298 align:start position:0%
find teachers paraprofessionals other
 
07:12:29.750 --> 07:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
staff who work in the school and so what
 
07:12:31.968 --> 07:12:31.978 align:start position:0%
kind of message does it send when the
 
07:12:34.788 --> 07:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
legislature is passing bills such as
 
07:12:37.310 --> 07:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
this that criminal I think was referred
 
07:12:41.208 --> 07:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
to earlier criminalizing education
 
07:12:41.218 --> 07:12:41.868 align:start position:0%
to earlier criminalizing education
um

07:12:41.868 --> 07:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:12:44.090 --> 07:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
so I don't see any point to that other
 
07:12:46.430 --> 07:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
than to create a climate of fear and
 
07:12:48.288 --> 07:12:48.298 align:start position:0%
intimidation among employees in the
 
07:12:48.298 --> 07:12:49.010 align:start position:0%
intimidation among employees in the
school

07:12:49.010 --> 07:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
school
 
07:12:52.190 --> 07:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
one of the other paragraphs related to
 
07:12:55.250 --> 07:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
violations also uh seemed confusing I
 
07:12:57.468 --> 07:12:57.478 align:start position:0%
think was originally paragraph three you
 
07:13:01.310 --> 07:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
now have 15 seconds right okay uh where
 
07:13:04.190 --> 07:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
it refers to a certified educator being
 
07:13:06.468 --> 07:13:06.478 align:start position:0%
found guilty of violating any section of
 
07:13:08.628 --> 07:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
this law I shall have their teaching
 
07:13:10.430 --> 07:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
credentials suspended
 
07:13:12.650 --> 07:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
uh confusing on how this would work
 
07:13:14.810 --> 07:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
because uh does this mean that they are
 
07:13:17.270 --> 07:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
found guilty by the school district by
 
07:13:19.010 --> 07:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
the doe
 
07:13:22.010 --> 07:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
um the sentences mixes uh credentialing
 
07:13:24.048 --> 07:13:24.058 align:start position:0%
and their employment which are handled
 
07:13:26.510 --> 07:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
by different entities so if you're a
 
07:13:29.090 --> 07:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
credentialed educator that means you're
 
07:13:31.968 --> 07:13:31.978 align:start position:0%
uh you have a license uh that okay
 
07:13:33.708 --> 07:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
you've gone way over and thank you for
 
07:13:36.230 --> 07:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
07:13:39.230 --> 07:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
yes please uh the chair recognizes
 
07:13:41.570 --> 07:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
Stephen scare with Cassandra Sanchez on
 
07:13:41.580 --> 07:13:56.230 align:start position:0%
Stephen scare with Cassandra Sanchez on
Deck

07:13:56.230 --> 07:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:59.690 --> 07:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
microphone please sir
 
07:14:01.368 --> 07:14:01.378 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Steven scare of
 
07:14:03.170 --> 07:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
Nashua and I'm here to speak in favor of
 
07:14:05.208 --> 07:14:05.218 align:start position:0%
this bill because parents need to
 
07:14:06.830 --> 07:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
protect their children from the belief
 
07:14:09.048 --> 07:14:09.058 align:start position:0%
systems that have become the established
 
07:14:11.048 --> 07:14:11.058 align:start position:0%
religions in public schools
 
07:14:13.490 --> 07:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
transgenderism teaches that children
 
07:14:15.890 --> 07:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
that they're born with gendered souls or
 
07:14:18.230 --> 07:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
gender identities and these not their
 
07:14:21.048 --> 07:14:21.058 align:start position:0%
bodies are their authentic selves those
 
07:14:23.930 --> 07:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
who claim that it isn't an ideology cite
 
07:14:25.850 --> 07:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
its recognitions by Professional Medical
 
07:14:28.430 --> 07:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
associations but it's a mistake to thank
 
07:14:30.468 --> 07:14:30.478 align:start position:0%
these professionals are less vulnerable
 
07:14:32.628 --> 07:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
to Dogma than anyone else
 
07:14:34.968 --> 07:14:34.978 align:start position:0%
for example Jeremy Coswell the director
 
07:14:37.010 --> 07:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
of gender services at Boston children
 
07:14:39.170 --> 07:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
said a child will know they are
 
07:14:41.030 --> 07:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
transgender from the moment they have an
 
07:14:43.670 --> 07:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
ability to express themselves we have
 
07:14:45.350 --> 07:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
parents that tell us their children knew
 
07:14:46.430 --> 07:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
from the minute they were born
 
07:14:49.310 --> 07:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
practically signs a toddler is trans
 
07:14:51.650 --> 07:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
include refusing to get a haircut trying
 
07:14:54.110 --> 07:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
to stand to urinate refusing to stand to
 
07:14:56.090 --> 07:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
urinate crying on a siblings clothing
 
07:14:58.548 --> 07:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
playing with quote the opposite gender
 
07:15:01.310 --> 07:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
toys there's nothing scientific and
 
07:15:03.530 --> 07:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
claiming that a newborn with no concept
 
07:15:05.810 --> 07:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
of sex or gender has an immutable
 
07:15:07.850 --> 07:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
identity which is expressed through
 
07:15:10.250 --> 07:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
gender stereotypes even though these
 
07:15:13.930 --> 07:15:13.940 align:start position:0%
stereotypes vary among cultures and eras
 
07:15:16.910 --> 07:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
these these ideas can only be understood
 
07:15:19.430 --> 07:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
in a religious context and the religion
 
07:15:21.548 --> 07:15:21.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong in public schools
 
07:15:24.110 --> 07:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
excluding cases of abuse when children
 
07:15:26.150 --> 07:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
are young they understand that when
 
07:15:28.250 --> 07:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
children When someone tells them to keep
 
07:15:29.930 --> 07:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
secrets from their moms and dads they're
 
07:15:31.610 --> 07:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
up to no good when they enter
 
07:15:33.830 --> 07:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
adolescence they push back against the
 
07:15:35.990 --> 07:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
parents activists are using the school
 
07:15:37.850 --> 07:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
to drive a wedge between their parents
 
07:15:39.890 --> 07:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
and children during this vulnerable
 
07:15:42.948 --> 07:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
stage regarding the suicide stats you've
 
07:15:47.170 --> 07:15:47.180 align:start position:0%
heard they come from online solicited
 
07:15:51.048 --> 07:15:51.058 align:start position:0%
surveys on LGBT sites we know that the
 
07:15:53.570 --> 07:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
real rate is less than a tenth of a
 
07:15:56.930 --> 07:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
percent and autism and anorexia have
 
07:15:59.390 --> 07:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
higher suicide rates thank you thank you
 
07:15:59.400 --> 07:16:00.350 align:start position:0%
higher suicide rates thank you thank you
sir

07:16:00.350 --> 07:16:00.360 align:start position:0%

07:16:03.170 --> 07:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Cassandra Sanchez with
 
07:16:09.530 --> 07:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:11.270 --> 07:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and committee
 
07:16:13.010 --> 07:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
members thank you for your time for the
 
07:16:14.810 --> 07:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
record Cassandra Sanchez child advocate
 
07:16:16.610 --> 07:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire
 
07:16:18.890 --> 07:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
I much like others had prepared
 
07:16:21.110 --> 07:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
testimony for the bill is introduced so
 
07:16:22.368 --> 07:16:22.378 align:start position:0%
I will share that written testimony with
 
07:16:23.628 --> 07:16:23.638 align:start position:0%
you today and I will follow up with an
 
07:16:25.968 --> 07:16:25.978 align:start position:0%
email with additional testimony that
 
07:16:28.968 --> 07:16:28.978 align:start position:0%
further covers some of the additions in
 
07:16:30.948 --> 07:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
the in the amendment
 
07:16:32.930 --> 07:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
um so as many of you know the office of
 
07:16:34.750 --> 07:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
the child advocate is an independent
 
07:16:38.570 --> 07:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
impartial state agency that is tasked
 
07:16:41.150 --> 07:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
through statute to ensure protections
 
07:16:43.910 --> 07:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
for all and I say all very clearly not
 
07:16:46.788 --> 07:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
some all New Hampshire children and that
 
07:16:49.310 --> 07:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
includes our lgbtq plus community and
 
07:16:50.810 --> 07:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
that includes all children that could be
 
07:16:52.190 --> 07:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill because there are
 
07:16:54.170 --> 07:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
others that have not been discussed
 
07:16:56.030 --> 07:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
before us today that could absolutely be
 
07:16:58.368 --> 07:16:58.378 align:start position:0%
impacted by this bill I spend much time
 
07:17:00.410 --> 07:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
meeting with children in the community
 
07:17:03.230 --> 07:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
and I also want to clarify for some that
 
07:17:05.030 --> 07:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
there has been misinformation shared
 
07:17:05.868 --> 07:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
here today
 
07:17:07.670 --> 07:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
there are absolutely children who are
 
07:17:10.190 --> 07:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
abused when they disclose
 
07:17:12.410 --> 07:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
their gender identity to their families
 
07:17:15.230 --> 07:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
my office reviews these on a daily basis
 
07:17:17.690 --> 07:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
we also spend a lot of time meeting with
 
07:17:19.788 --> 07:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
these children much of most of which end
 
07:17:21.948 --> 07:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
up in residential facilities many ending
 
07:17:23.030 --> 07:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
up out of the state of New Hampshire
 
07:17:26.270 --> 07:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
with minimal oversight and minimal
 
07:17:28.968 --> 07:17:28.978 align:start position:0%
trusted adults to check in on them
 
07:17:31.730 --> 07:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
these children matter and we need to
 
07:17:33.650 --> 07:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
protect these children I have respect
 
07:17:35.690 --> 07:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
for parental rights but they should not
 
07:17:39.468 --> 07:17:39.478 align:start position:0%
come before the safety of our children
 
07:17:41.270 --> 07:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
I also believe that this bill leaves
 
07:17:45.650 --> 07:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
room for interference in law enforcement
 
07:17:49.070 --> 07:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
and dcyf investigations
 
07:17:51.350 --> 07:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
the as many had come before and
 
07:17:52.968 --> 07:17:52.978 align:start position:0%
mentioned trusted adults are very
 
07:17:54.350 --> 07:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
important for disclosures for children
 
07:17:57.590 --> 07:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
by severing that or um
 
07:18:00.530 --> 07:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
or the liability over the heads of those
 
07:18:02.510 --> 07:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
trusted adults and concerns for them to
 
07:18:04.788 --> 07:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
be able to protect those children and
 
07:18:07.010 --> 07:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
report we understand that children are
 
07:18:08.990 --> 07:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
at risk of not disclosing abuse in the
 
07:18:11.330 --> 07:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
home including as far as sexual abuse
 
07:18:12.890 --> 07:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
that can be occurring that they will not
 
07:18:15.530 --> 07:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
be disclosing that abuse and therefore
 
07:18:17.270 --> 07:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
it will not either get to law
 
07:18:19.128 --> 07:18:19.138 align:start position:0%
enforcement or if shared with law
 
07:18:21.410 --> 07:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the school is then
 
07:18:23.868 --> 07:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
tasked with sharing with a parent it
 
07:18:25.930 --> 07:18:25.940 align:start position:0%
could interfere with the law enforcement
 
07:18:28.070 --> 07:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
in this regard
 
07:18:29.690 --> 07:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
um so lastly as I had mentioned I meet
 
07:18:31.010 --> 07:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
with these children in residential
 
07:18:32.448 --> 07:18:32.458 align:start position:0%
facilities and what I hear from these
 
07:18:33.830 --> 07:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
children the voice I want you to hear
 
07:18:37.368 --> 07:18:37.378 align:start position:0%
today from my office is that these
 
07:18:39.468 --> 07:18:39.478 align:start position:0%
children want to have adults that care
 
07:18:41.150 --> 07:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
for them they want to be in safe
 
07:18:43.010 --> 07:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
environments but they unfortunately
 
07:18:44.690 --> 07:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
understand that that is not always going
 
07:18:45.948 --> 07:18:45.958 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
07:18:48.230 --> 07:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony the
 
07:18:50.510 --> 07:18:50.520 align:start position:0%

10 grow up in China during miles regime
 
07:19:51.830 --> 07:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
I never heard of concept of parental
 
07:19:55.010 --> 07:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
rights and everything child in China
 
07:19:57.830 --> 07:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
even today belong to the government
 
07:20:00.770 --> 07:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
and I remember when I was growing up I'm
 
07:20:03.288 --> 07:20:03.298 align:start position:0%
totally subject to the whims of Central
 
07:20:06.170 --> 07:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
plannings and the centralized education
 
07:20:09.708 --> 07:20:09.718 align:start position:0%
and the first induct relation I was a
 
07:20:12.350 --> 07:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
young Pioneer Red Guard and throughout
 
07:20:15.468 --> 07:20:15.478 align:start position:0%
my school years and the CCB is still
 
07:20:18.230 --> 07:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
controlling all education I was
 
07:20:21.770 --> 07:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
forbidden to see my own student file
 
07:20:24.048 --> 07:20:24.058 align:start position:0%
think about I'm gonna I brought my
 
07:20:26.208 --> 07:20:26.218 align:start position:0%
picture of my Middle School Portraits
 
07:20:28.788 --> 07:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
here okay you want to see
 
07:20:32.270 --> 07:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
every year as a student in schools I
 
07:20:34.670 --> 07:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
have to take a portrait to put into my
 
07:20:37.670 --> 07:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
secret student file and my parents were
 
07:20:40.310 --> 07:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
not allowed to see it and I was never
 
07:20:43.010 --> 07:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
allowed to see it you know why because
 
07:20:46.490 --> 07:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
it's only belongs to this state the the
 
07:20:49.430 --> 07:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
government and the future employers can
 
07:20:53.030 --> 07:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
see it but not my parents
 
07:20:54.968 --> 07:20:54.978 align:start position:0%
I came to America
 
07:20:58.670 --> 07:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
1988 thinking freedom and individual
 
07:21:01.208 --> 07:21:01.218 align:start position:0%
rights I got involvement in education
 
07:21:03.948 --> 07:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
because my kids were going to Public
 
07:21:07.610 --> 07:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
Schools 20 years ago what a concern me
 
07:21:11.090 --> 07:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
is what I see today in America kind of
 
07:21:14.330 --> 07:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
remind me what my personal experience in
 
07:21:18.170 --> 07:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
China under a Communist Regime the fact
 
07:21:21.230 --> 07:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
I have to come here to defend parental
 
07:21:23.590 --> 07:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
rights it's a very very
 
07:21:27.170 --> 07:21:27.180 align:start position:0%
and concerning I think this bill right
 
07:21:29.510 --> 07:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
now is absolutely necessary in today's
 
07:21:33.890 --> 07:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
political climate and it clarifies and
 
07:21:37.128 --> 07:21:37.138 align:start position:0%
protects one of the most ancient natural
 
07:21:39.650 --> 07:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
rights of human beings parental
 
07:21:43.128 --> 07:21:43.138 align:start position:0%
sovereignty 15 seconds to go the deepest
 
07:21:46.430 --> 07:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
human pound is between parents and their
 
07:21:49.190 --> 07:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
children if you're opposed to this bill
 
07:21:53.830 --> 07:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
I wonder what has American become and
 
07:21:56.448 --> 07:21:56.458 align:start position:0%
also today
 
07:21:58.670 --> 07:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
you see this National
 
07:22:01.910 --> 07:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
things going on all over the country I
 
07:22:03.830 --> 07:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
feel like we have a more opposition
 
07:22:06.468 --> 07:22:06.478 align:start position:0%
today than supporting parental rights
 
07:22:09.350 --> 07:22:09.360 align:start position:0%

I have been transitioning for two years
 
07:22:47.448 --> 07:22:47.458 align:start position:0%
and I had spent
 
07:22:51.410 --> 07:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
eight years prior to this year in the

closet

07:22:52.910 --> 07:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
closet
 
07:22:56.390 --> 07:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
one of those years I had spent being a
 
07:22:59.090 --> 07:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
jerk to everybody I knew because of how
 
07:23:00.530 --> 07:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
much I thought that they would never
 
07:23:03.890 --> 07:23:03.900 align:start position:0%

I'm saying or whatever it's going to say
 
07:24:10.368 --> 07:24:10.378 align:start position:0%
is I will highlight some of the more
 
07:24:12.170 --> 07:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
glaring problems that pit parents
 
07:24:14.330 --> 07:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
against schools this can also drive a
 
07:24:16.548 --> 07:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
division between parent and child
 
07:24:18.410 --> 07:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
School administrators are not following
 
07:24:20.510 --> 07:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
federal law and ethical codes of conduct
 
07:24:22.430 --> 07:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
by assessing and treating mental health
 
07:24:25.310 --> 07:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
of students with when they are treating
 
07:24:27.410 --> 07:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
mental the mental health of students
 
07:24:30.230 --> 07:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
without informed consent by parents
 
07:24:31.910 --> 07:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
children attending some of our public
 
07:24:33.230 --> 07:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
schools have had their Mental Health
 
07:24:35.628 --> 07:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
Data shared with outside organizations
 
07:24:37.670 --> 07:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
like Plymouth State Antioch University
 
07:24:40.070 --> 07:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
and Keene State this is a violation of
 
07:24:42.410 --> 07:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
the school counselor's code of ethics
 
07:24:44.030 --> 07:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
school counselors are to maintain
 
07:24:44.040 --> 07:24:45.530 align:start position:0%
school counselors are to maintain
privacy

07:24:45.530 --> 07:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
07:24:47.150 --> 07:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
on those records but that is not
 
07:24:49.430 --> 07:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
happening in our Public Schools parents
 
07:24:51.048 --> 07:24:51.058 align:start position:0%
have been shocked to hear the sensitive
 
07:24:52.968 --> 07:24:52.978 align:start position:0%
data is leaving the district without any
 
07:24:54.650 --> 07:24:54.660 align:start position:0%
informed consent
 
07:24:56.628 --> 07:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to expand on that if you would
 
07:24:56.638 --> 07:24:57.350 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to expand on that if you would
like

07:24:57.350 --> 07:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
like
 
07:25:00.708 --> 07:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
so who's being targeted right now School
 
07:25:02.810 --> 07:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
Board policy jbab if you're not familiar
 
07:25:04.128 --> 07:25:04.138 align:start position:0%
with it was developed by the New
 
07:25:06.350 --> 07:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association the
 
07:25:08.150 --> 07:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
policy included a provision that told
 
07:25:09.770 --> 07:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
staff that they must slide appearance
 
07:25:12.708 --> 07:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
now so under the privacy policy J
 
07:25:15.110 --> 07:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
Babbitt reads School Personnel shall not
 
07:25:17.030 --> 07:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
disclose information that may reveal a
 
07:25:19.310 --> 07:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
student's transgender status or gender
 
07:25:21.890 --> 07:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
non-conforming presentation to others
 
07:25:23.750 --> 07:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
including parents so parents are
 
07:25:24.770 --> 07:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
actually the ones that have been
 
07:25:26.990 --> 07:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
targeted in these schools the New
 
07:25:28.368 --> 07:25:28.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Administration
 
07:25:30.230 --> 07:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
did finally withdraw their support for
 
07:25:32.570 --> 07:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
jbab after a lawsuit was filed in
 
07:25:35.330 --> 07:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester this case is being taken to
 
07:25:36.530 --> 07:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court and it's currently
 
07:25:38.868 --> 07:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
pending there this parent was never
 
07:25:40.910 --> 07:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
given due process which is a lot of what
 
07:25:42.590 --> 07:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing today a lot of guilty
 
07:25:44.150 --> 07:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
parents with absolutely no talk about
 
07:25:46.968 --> 07:25:46.978 align:start position:0%
due process to them
 
07:25:46.978 --> 07:25:47.930 align:start position:0%
due process to them
um

07:25:47.930 --> 07:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:25:49.850 --> 07:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
we now have policies in place that
 
07:25:52.010 --> 07:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
require School Personnel to to lie to
 
07:25:53.390 --> 07:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
loving parents this child was
 
07:25:54.590 --> 07:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
transferred out of the Manchester
 
07:25:56.448 --> 07:25:56.458 align:start position:0%
schools and now going to a charter
 
07:25:56.458 --> 07:25:57.468 align:start position:0%
schools and now going to a charter
school

07:25:57.468 --> 07:25:57.478 align:start position:0%
school
 
07:25:59.208 --> 07:25:59.218 align:start position:0%
statements from those against parental
 
07:26:01.010 --> 07:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
rights paint parents as abusive or
 
07:26:03.770 --> 07:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
neglectful with no due process even
 
07:26:06.830 --> 07:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
cases of sexual abuse that abuse that
 
07:26:09.590 --> 07:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
happened in by school personnel and
 
07:26:12.170 --> 07:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
teachers go through due process first we
 
07:26:14.270 --> 07:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
don't paint all teachers as possible
 
07:26:17.208 --> 07:26:17.218 align:start position:0%
child molesters anti-parent policies
 
07:26:19.128 --> 07:26:19.138 align:start position:0%
Drive families away from their Public
 
07:26:21.708 --> 07:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
Schools so when this when this is
 
07:26:23.390 --> 07:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
happening what's happening what I'm
 
07:26:24.830 --> 07:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
seeing is parents are pulling their kids
 
07:26:26.390 --> 07:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
out of the public school you've got 10
 
07:26:29.270 --> 07:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
seconds to wrap it up okay
 
07:26:31.368 --> 07:26:31.378 align:start position:0%
um I do want to mention that the FERPA
 
07:26:33.468 --> 07:26:33.478 align:start position:0%
law does require that or this allow for
 
07:26:35.330 --> 07:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
parents to review their their child's
 
07:26:38.030 --> 07:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
records so that's already in law so I'm
 
07:26:40.190 --> 07:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
not sure how we're going to how there's
 
07:26:41.750 --> 07:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
policy in place that says that you can
 
07:26:43.430 --> 07:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
lie to a parent
 
07:26:46.490 --> 07:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
um jbab clearly violates FERPA thank you
 
07:26:49.910 --> 07:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
for your testimony appreciate it Chris
 
07:26:55.548 --> 07:26:55.558 align:start position:0%
urchil and um uh Karen Hill as I can
 
07:27:05.448 --> 07:27:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:15.070 --> 07:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:17.270 --> 07:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Pearson thank you
 
07:27:18.830 --> 07:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee it's been a
 
07:27:20.868 --> 07:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
long day bear with me
 
07:27:22.190 --> 07:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
um my name is Chris Churchill I'm an
 
07:27:24.288 --> 07:27:24.298 align:start position:0%
attorney with glbtq legal Advocates and
 
07:27:27.590 --> 07:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
Defenders better known as glad I am here
 
07:27:30.048 --> 07:27:30.058 align:start position:0%
to talk exclusively about page four
 
07:27:33.590 --> 07:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
lines four through nine subsections WX
 
07:27:35.810 --> 07:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
and Y other people have done a great job
 
07:27:37.610 --> 07:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
testifying about other aspects of the
 
07:27:40.250 --> 07:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
bill but I'm here to talk speak in
 
07:27:43.310 --> 07:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
opposition to those specific Provisions
 
07:27:45.468 --> 07:27:45.478 align:start position:0%
um teachers at Public Schools come into
 
07:27:47.930 --> 07:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
contact with information about students
 
07:27:50.750 --> 07:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
identity development in countless ways
 
07:27:52.730 --> 07:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
that might include
 
07:27:54.830 --> 07:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
um for instance say a Muslim student who
 
07:27:56.330 --> 07:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
decides she doesn't want to where he her
 
07:27:59.810 --> 07:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
hijab in class anymore is it a teacher's
 
07:28:02.030 --> 07:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
obligation to disclose that information
 
07:28:04.430 --> 07:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
to a parent maybe it is maybe it isn't
 
07:28:06.770 --> 07:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
maybe the circumstances uh are dependent
 
07:28:09.890 --> 07:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
what this bill does which is uh which is
 
07:28:12.830 --> 07:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
unusual and untenable is it singles out
 
07:28:14.810 --> 07:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
one characteristic of student an
 
07:28:16.910 --> 07:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
identity and that's a student's gender
 
07:28:20.090 --> 07:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
identity and says that's subject to a
 
07:28:22.730 --> 07:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
different standard for for teachers this
 
07:28:26.150 --> 07:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
bill could easily uh say that that that
 
07:28:28.490 --> 07:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
whenever information is requested by a
 
07:28:30.948 --> 07:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
parent about any aspect of a student's
 
07:28:34.010 --> 07:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
development at school that the teacher
 
07:28:35.810 --> 07:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
or School personnel must tell the truth
 
07:28:38.930 --> 07:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
instead the bill doesn't do that it uh
 
07:28:40.968 --> 07:28:40.978 align:start position:0%
it singles out transgender students
 
07:28:43.010 --> 07:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
because of their gender identity and
 
07:28:45.468 --> 07:28:45.478 align:start position:0%
that's it that's the only identity
 
07:28:47.390 --> 07:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
aspect that's identified in here and
 
07:28:48.288 --> 07:28:48.298 align:start position:0%
that's a huge problem that's
 
07:28:49.910 --> 07:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional it singles out a group
 
07:28:51.110 --> 07:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
of people for different treatment under
 
07:28:53.030 --> 07:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
the law and that's not what the law does
 
07:28:54.708 --> 07:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
and not in New Hampshire and not in the
 
07:28:57.288 --> 07:28:57.298 align:start position:0%
United States I also want to flag that
 
07:29:00.708 --> 07:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
subsection y uh which refers to the
 
07:29:02.390 --> 07:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
right to know about what extracurricular
 
07:29:04.190 --> 07:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
activities are clubs a student is
 
07:29:05.750 --> 07:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
participating in is especially
 
07:29:07.788 --> 07:29:07.798 align:start position:0%
problematic for students who are
 
07:29:09.948 --> 07:29:09.958 align:start position:0%
questioning their identity and are
 
07:29:12.048 --> 07:29:12.058 align:start position:0%
looking for a safe space to join a club
 
07:29:14.390 --> 07:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
to talk to their peers in a safe space
 
07:29:16.250 --> 07:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
and I know you've heard countless people
 
07:29:17.930 --> 07:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
talk about this today but it cannot be
 
07:29:19.850 --> 07:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
underestimated how critical that can be
 
07:29:21.948 --> 07:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
for a child's safe and healthy
 
07:29:23.208 --> 07:29:23.218 align:start position:0%
development it doesn't mean the kid's
 
07:29:24.830 --> 07:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
not going to talk to their parents it
 
07:29:26.570 --> 07:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
means the kid is having a moment where
 
07:29:28.250 --> 07:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to go into a safe
 
07:29:30.770 --> 07:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
place and that access to that place is
 
07:29:32.570 --> 07:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
in those seconds okay access to that
 
07:29:34.968 --> 07:29:34.978 align:start position:0%
place uh a kid is not going to feel
 
07:29:36.170 --> 07:29:36.180 align:start position:0%
comfortable going in there if they know
 
07:29:37.610 --> 07:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be broadcast to other
 
07:29:39.948 --> 07:29:39.958 align:start position:0%
people even back home so in conclusion
 
07:29:41.570 --> 07:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
schools work in partnership with parents
 
07:29:43.250 --> 07:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
I think that's great I think it's bad
 
07:29:44.510 --> 07:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill singles that transgender
 
07:29:46.910 --> 07:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
people I got a question actually I have
 
07:29:46.920 --> 07:29:48.230 align:start position:0%
people I got a question actually I have
to

07:29:48.230 --> 07:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:29:52.810 --> 07:29:52.820 align:start position:0%
um back to the hijab if a Muslim parent
 
07:29:56.030 --> 07:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
asked a teacher
 
07:29:58.548 --> 07:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
is your child wearing one
 
07:30:00.230 --> 07:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
would you be comfortable with the
 
07:30:02.330 --> 07:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
teacher giving the truth
 
07:30:04.190 --> 07:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
this bill says nothing about it I'm not
 
07:30:09.230 --> 07:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:11.750 --> 07:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
if any question is asked about student
 
07:30:13.310 --> 07:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
development I think the teacher should
 
07:30:15.170 --> 07:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
on it I honestly I don't think teachers
 
07:30:16.730 --> 07:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
should ever be giving misinformation to
 
07:30:18.890 --> 07:30:18.900 align:start position:0%
parents or lying to parents
 
07:30:20.270 --> 07:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
um about any aspect of a student's
 
07:30:21.770 --> 07:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
development or a student's identity this
 
07:30:23.690 --> 07:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
bill could could like you know address
 
07:30:26.390 --> 07:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
that potentiality by by prohibiting it
 
07:30:28.788 --> 07:30:28.798 align:start position:0%
but instead it singles out one aspect of
 
07:30:30.708 --> 07:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
student identity and says that's subject
 
07:30:32.270 --> 07:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
to a special a special version of
 
07:30:34.368 --> 07:30:34.378 align:start position:0%
scrutiny that's what's untenable about I
 
07:30:35.990 --> 07:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
know you brought us back to that just
 
07:30:37.850 --> 07:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
now very well done by the way you're
 
07:30:37.860 --> 07:30:38.990 align:start position:0%
now very well done by the way you're
welcome

07:30:38.990 --> 07:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
07:30:41.628 --> 07:30:41.638 align:start position:0%
um but you open the door because you
 
07:30:43.610 --> 07:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
broadened it what about and you use that
 
07:30:46.368 --> 07:30:46.378 align:start position:0%
example so I just wanted to see if the
 
07:30:48.590 --> 07:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
teacher like so you're setting up a
 
07:30:50.868 --> 07:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
hypothetical yes it is so setting up a
 
07:30:53.030 --> 07:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
hypothetical that's an amendment parent
 
07:30:55.250 --> 07:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
comes to comes to school personnel and
 
07:30:57.590 --> 07:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
asks a question is my kid wearing her
 
07:31:00.650 --> 07:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
hijab in class uh and if a teacher were
 
07:31:03.468 --> 07:31:03.478 align:start position:0%
to say no I mean yes your kid is wearing
 
07:31:04.968 --> 07:31:04.978 align:start position:0%
a hijab just like you expect and that's
 
07:31:07.250 --> 07:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
not true that would be very unusual I've
 
07:31:09.230 --> 07:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
never heard of a teacher blatantly lying
 
07:31:11.448 --> 07:31:11.458 align:start position:0%
to a parent on upon an inquiry like that
 
07:31:13.910 --> 07:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
but if that did happen I wouldn't be I
 
07:31:15.650 --> 07:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be here opposing a law that
 
07:31:17.030 --> 07:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
would prohibit that I'll just say that
 
07:31:20.390 --> 07:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay and my other question is suppose
 
07:31:23.150 --> 07:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
one of my grandchildren
 
07:31:24.890 --> 07:31:24.900 align:start position:0%
um in spite of we could do everything
 
07:31:27.530 --> 07:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
you can decides to join the Confederate
 
07:31:30.590 --> 07:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
Army club and they go through battles
 
07:31:33.230 --> 07:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
and they tweak them so their guys win
 
07:31:36.490 --> 07:31:36.500 align:start position:0%
and everything that went behind that
 
07:31:40.368 --> 07:31:40.378 align:start position:0%
and I thought some little strange things
 
07:31:42.830 --> 07:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
were going on at the house and I said to
 
07:31:44.570 --> 07:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
the teacher
 
07:31:47.330 --> 07:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
did my kid join a Confederate Army Club
 
07:31:50.030 --> 07:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
at school would you be comfortable with
 
07:31:52.730 --> 07:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
the teacher saying yes he did
 
07:31:54.230 --> 07:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
actually I think clubs are a special
 
07:31:56.208 --> 07:31:56.218 align:start position:0%
case I think where where students want
 
07:31:59.090 --> 07:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
to engage with ever who knows why the
 
07:32:01.070 --> 07:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
kid is attending that club right teacher
 
07:32:03.288 --> 07:32:03.298 align:start position:0%
doesn't know why uh the parents probably
 
07:32:05.150 --> 07:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
have a better idea than anyone about why
 
07:32:06.590 --> 07:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
and I think that's an excellent
 
07:32:08.330 --> 07:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a teacher to say to that
 
07:32:10.548 --> 07:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
parent uh
 
07:32:12.110 --> 07:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry excellent opportunity for
 
07:32:13.430 --> 07:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
the teacher to say to that parent to
 
07:32:15.048 --> 07:32:15.058 align:start position:0%
engage with that parent and say this is
 
07:32:16.430 --> 07:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
a conversation you really need to be
 
07:32:18.468 --> 07:32:18.478 align:start position:0%
having with your kid what support can we
 
07:32:20.570 --> 07:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
give you as a school we have school
 
07:32:22.310 --> 07:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
counselors School psychologists guidance
 
07:32:24.468 --> 07:32:24.478 align:start position:0%
counselors and social workers
 
07:32:26.390 --> 07:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
um what support can we give you to make
 
07:32:28.128 --> 07:32:28.138 align:start position:0%
you able to have this conversation at
 
07:32:29.628 --> 07:32:29.638 align:start position:0%
home with your kid
 
07:32:31.010 --> 07:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
um about about the things that are
 
07:32:32.270 --> 07:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
concerning you I think that there's a
 
07:32:34.010 --> 07:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
that is a totally appropriate response
 
07:32:35.448 --> 07:32:35.458 align:start position:0%
but I don't necessarily think that
 
07:32:37.910 --> 07:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
joining a club especially a pride club
 
07:32:39.590 --> 07:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
or a GSA I don't think that information
 
07:32:41.990 --> 07:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
should be made available ever
 
07:32:45.410 --> 07:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other questions
 
07:32:47.270 --> 07:32:47.280 align:start position:0%

very much my name is Karen Leo Hill I'm
 
07:33:19.968 --> 07:33:19.978 align:start position:0%
an 18-year Lebanon City councilor and
 
07:33:22.010 --> 07:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
mother to two children one of whom is
 
07:33:23.750 --> 07:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
here with me today and is also on your
 
07:33:25.548 --> 07:33:25.558 align:start position:0%
list to testify
 
07:33:29.270 --> 07:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'm 44. I was born in 1978 as a child
 
07:33:32.090 --> 07:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
growing up in a small charismatic
 
07:33:35.110 --> 07:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
Evangelical Church I remember that
 
07:33:39.590 --> 07:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
homosexuality was a taboo topic
 
07:33:41.330 --> 07:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
I remember when I was around 10 years
 
07:33:44.150 --> 07:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
old the pastor of the church had
 
07:33:46.310 --> 07:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
recently discovered that his teenage son
 
07:33:50.448 --> 07:33:50.458 align:start position:0%
was gay and he rebuked his son in front
 
07:33:52.850 --> 07:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
of the congregation and made him leave
 
07:33:54.708 --> 07:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
the sanctuary
 
07:33:56.750 --> 07:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
a couple years later my best friend's
 
07:34:00.650 --> 07:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
older brother was outed to his parents
 
07:34:04.850 --> 07:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:07.490 --> 07:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
most parents love their children and
 
07:34:08.990 --> 07:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
want to have open and honest
 
07:34:10.910 --> 07:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
communication and loving relationships
 
07:34:14.208 --> 07:34:14.218 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately that is not always the
 
07:34:18.110 --> 07:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
case for All Families as legislators you
 
07:34:20.150 --> 07:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
are being asked to consider
 
07:34:22.910 --> 07:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
those circumstances when people don't
 
07:34:26.868 --> 07:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
have the safest home situation
 
07:34:29.208 --> 07:34:29.218 align:start position:0%
that's what this legislation is about
 
07:34:31.190 --> 07:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately these stories that took
 
07:34:33.708 --> 07:34:33.718 align:start position:0%
place 30 years ago are not relics of the
 
07:34:37.010 --> 07:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
past some families today still cannot
 
07:34:38.810 --> 07:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
accept their children
 
07:34:41.090 --> 07:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
and will not allow them to freely
 
07:34:43.670 --> 07:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
Express themselves at home and for some
 
07:34:45.590 --> 07:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
children the only place they may be able
 
07:34:47.868 --> 07:34:47.878 align:start position:0%
to express themselves freely is in
 
07:34:47.878 --> 07:34:49.490 align:start position:0%
to express themselves freely is in
school

07:34:49.490 --> 07:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
school
 
07:34:51.770 --> 07:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
to me this bill is about safety and
 
07:34:53.208 --> 07:34:53.218 align:start position:0%
health and what's in the best interest
 
07:34:55.548 --> 07:34:55.558 align:start position:0%
of our children we know that teenagers
 
07:34:58.010 --> 07:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
are facing a mental health crisis we
 
07:34:59.690 --> 07:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
know that queer teenagers especially
 
07:35:02.750 --> 07:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
trans youth are at the greatest risk of
 
07:35:05.390 --> 07:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
harming themselves this legislation has
 
07:35:07.310 --> 07:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
the potential to put many New Hampshire
 
07:35:09.530 --> 07:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
youth in traumatic
 
07:35:13.368 --> 07:35:13.378 align:start position:0%
and stressful situations like the ones
 
07:35:16.610 --> 07:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
experienced by my pastor's Son by my
 
07:35:19.010 --> 07:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
best friend's brother and even my own
 
07:35:19.020 --> 07:35:20.030 align:start position:0%
best friend's brother and even my own
uncle

uncle
 
07:35:21.650 --> 07:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
we have a chance to make the world a
 
07:35:23.868 --> 07:35:23.878 align:start position:0%
better place for today's kids at least
 
07:35:26.868 --> 07:35:26.878 align:start position:0%

07:36:12.650 --> 07:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
good after I've been Representatives my
 
07:36:14.930 --> 07:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
name is Zoe Hill I'm a 16 year old
 
07:36:16.788 --> 07:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
Junior at Lebanon High School
 
07:36:19.788 --> 07:36:19.798 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to oppose hb10
 
07:36:21.948 --> 07:36:21.958 align:start position:0%
this bill will not directly affect me
 
07:36:24.170 --> 07:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
because I am lucky enough to have
 
07:36:26.330 --> 07:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
parents who support me and my identity
 
07:36:28.128 --> 07:36:28.138 align:start position:0%
as a trans kid
 
07:36:30.410 --> 07:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
but I know multiple people who could
 
07:36:33.288 --> 07:36:33.298 align:start position:0%
face true harm if this bill passes
 
07:36:34.788 --> 07:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
they are out in school but not
 
07:36:36.590 --> 07:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily at home because their
 
07:36:39.048 --> 07:36:39.058 align:start position:0%
families would not accept them if they
 
07:36:42.048 --> 07:36:42.058 align:start position:0%
found out that they were trans
 
07:36:44.448 --> 07:36:44.458 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes and their parents
 
07:36:46.610 --> 07:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
did find out they are trans then their
 
07:36:48.468 --> 07:36:48.478 align:start position:0%
homes would become an even more
 
07:36:50.510 --> 07:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
dangerous place for them
 
07:36:53.208 --> 07:36:53.218 align:start position:0%
in conclusion please oppose this bill
 
07:36:56.030 --> 07:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
for the sake of trans kids all across
 
07:36:58.670 --> 07:36:58.680 align:start position:0%

07:38:09.468 --> 07:38:09.478 align:start position:0%
support team with parents but we know
 
07:38:12.110 --> 07:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
that that does not um
 
07:38:14.990 --> 07:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
happen in all situations
 
07:38:16.368 --> 07:38:16.378 align:start position:0%
um you know sometimes there are
 
07:38:19.070 --> 07:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
situations where where we cannot uh be
 
07:38:22.010 --> 07:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
on the same side with parents in all the
 
07:38:24.350 --> 07:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
time but with this specific bill I want
 
07:38:26.390 --> 07:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
to make a few quick points the penalties
 
07:38:28.548 --> 07:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
in this bill are
 
07:38:30.650 --> 07:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
um problematic where you could lose your
 
07:38:32.990 --> 07:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
license for
 
07:38:34.910 --> 07:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
um you know violating
 
07:38:37.310 --> 07:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
um any part of the bill
 
07:38:39.708 --> 07:38:39.718 align:start position:0%
um there's some vague wording here about
 
07:38:41.690 --> 07:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
each parent directing their own child's
 
07:38:43.548 --> 07:38:43.558 align:start position:0%
education which sounds lovely but when
 
07:38:45.708 --> 07:38:45.718 align:start position:0%
you have a classroom of 20 kids and each
 
07:38:46.968 --> 07:38:46.978 align:start position:0%
individual parent wants something
 
07:38:49.788 --> 07:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
different for their child how do you
 
07:38:52.610 --> 07:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
manage to teach all of those children in
 
07:38:54.650 --> 07:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
the classroom that's a concern but the
 
07:38:56.650 --> 07:38:56.660 align:start position:0%
biggest thing is that in a public school
 
07:38:58.670 --> 07:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
teachers and School staff are
 
07:39:01.250 --> 07:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure that each
 
07:39:04.548 --> 07:39:04.558 align:start position:0%
and every student is welcome and feels
 
07:39:06.350 --> 07:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
safe at school
 
07:39:09.288 --> 07:39:09.298 align:start position:0%
we are responsible under our code of
 
07:39:10.968 --> 07:39:10.978 align:start position:0%
conduct for treating them with respect
 
07:39:12.830 --> 07:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
and the parts that have been pointed out
 
07:39:12.840 --> 07:39:13.810 align:start position:0%
and the parts that have been pointed out
here

07:39:13.810 --> 07:39:13.820 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:39:16.010 --> 07:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
would require discriminating against
 
07:39:19.190 --> 07:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
some of our students and we just we
 
07:39:21.110 --> 07:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
can't accept that I mean that's why
 
07:39:22.968 --> 07:39:22.978 align:start position:0%
we're opposing this bill we will not
 
07:39:26.330 --> 07:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
treat some of our students with you know
 
07:39:29.810 --> 07:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practices uh as this bill
 
07:39:32.810 --> 07:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
will call for and you put us in a
 
07:39:34.850 --> 07:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
position of possibly losing our license
 
07:39:39.288 --> 07:39:39.298 align:start position:0%
and our job if we do uh if we violate
 
07:39:43.190 --> 07:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
that position or violating our code of
 
07:39:45.468 --> 07:39:45.478 align:start position:0%
conduct which also comes with loss of
 
07:39:47.570 --> 07:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
license and job it's not a great
 
07:39:51.048 --> 07:39:51.058 align:start position:0%
position to be in and you are in a
 
07:39:53.030 --> 07:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
shortage of educational staff in this
 
07:39:55.250 --> 07:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
state in all positions so it really is
 
07:39:57.708 --> 07:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
not the best thing for our students
 
07:40:00.230 --> 07:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
who need teachers in the classroom to
 
07:40:02.270 --> 07:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
educate them I had no idea how long
 
07:40:03.770 --> 07:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
you've been testifying because I wasn't
 
07:40:05.868 --> 07:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
looking and he left but it's you made a
 
07:40:07.670 --> 07:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
great presentation I'll give you 15
 
07:40:09.948 --> 07:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
seconds more if you want it
 
07:40:11.990 --> 07:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
um about all I want to say you're good
 
07:40:13.250 --> 07:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
otherwise I would have to go on to
 
07:40:14.510 --> 07:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
another topic and it would be more than
 
07:40:16.610 --> 07:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
15 seconds I could say more but I I
 
07:40:18.890 --> 07:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
think you know in recognition of the
 
07:40:20.930 --> 07:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
lateness of the day and your patience
 
07:40:22.968 --> 07:40:22.978 align:start position:0%
would you believe in 16 years of
 
07:40:24.650 --> 07:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
teaching graduate school all of my
 
07:40:26.150 --> 07:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
students wanted individualized
 
07:40:28.070 --> 07:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum too I'm sure they do thank
 
07:40:29.570 --> 07:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
you very much it gets worse the older
 
07:40:31.990 --> 07:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
they get all right uh Kendra Ford please
 
07:40:35.930 --> 07:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
Kendra Ford no Kendra Ford
 
07:40:38.208 --> 07:40:38.218 align:start position:0%
um Don Johnson
 
07:40:45.288 --> 07:40:45.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:47.270 --> 07:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know I run a loose committee I'll
 
07:40:49.128 --> 07:40:49.138 align:start position:0%
take much more of that
 
07:40:54.968 --> 07:40:54.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:57.048 --> 07:40:57.058 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
07:40:58.968 --> 07:40:58.978 align:start position:0%
committee members I'm going to keep this
 
07:41:00.350 --> 07:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
very brief
 
07:41:02.750 --> 07:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
um partially because I was not in here
 
07:41:04.968 --> 07:41:04.978 align:start position:0%
for a lot of the testimony
 
07:41:06.288 --> 07:41:06.298 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want to repeat anything
 
07:41:10.070 --> 07:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm here today for two people one
 
07:41:13.250 --> 07:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
was a trans kid and the other was her
 
07:41:16.310 --> 07:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
mother I was the case manager she was an
 
07:41:19.128 --> 07:41:19.138 align:start position:0%
abused child at young child the mother
 
07:41:21.350 --> 07:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
did the appropriate thing and protected
 
07:41:23.750 --> 07:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
her child she went on to school
 
07:41:27.590 --> 07:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
she was part of the one trusted adult
 
07:41:27.600 --> 07:41:30.170 align:start position:0%
she was part of the one trusted adult
program

07:41:30.170 --> 07:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
program
 
07:41:30.180 --> 07:41:31.368 align:start position:0%
program
um

07:41:31.368 --> 07:41:31.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:41:36.350 --> 07:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
she came out to a at 12 years old she
 
07:41:38.570 --> 07:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
came out to a teacher
 
07:41:38.580 --> 07:41:40.730 align:start position:0%
came out to a teacher
um and

07:41:40.730 --> 07:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
um and
 
07:41:42.890 --> 07:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
um it was kept from the mother
 
07:41:47.650 --> 07:41:47.660 align:start position:0%
uh they started her on transitioning
 
07:41:51.708 --> 07:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
with uh hormones in the school system
 
07:41:54.070 --> 07:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
without parents knowledge
 
07:41:56.448 --> 07:41:56.458 align:start position:0%
they um
 
07:41:58.968 --> 07:41:58.978 align:start position:0%
so at 12 12 years old they started
 
07:42:01.730 --> 07:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
transitioning her at 16 years old she
 
07:42:02.930 --> 07:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
took her life
 
07:42:05.208 --> 07:42:05.218 align:start position:0%
but she took her life because she was
 
07:42:08.030 --> 07:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
she wanted to de-transition and she
 
07:42:10.670 --> 07:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
didn't feel like she had anyone to talk
 
07:42:10.680 --> 07:42:11.510 align:start position:0%
didn't feel like she had anyone to talk
to

07:42:11.510 --> 07:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:42:14.270 --> 07:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
but more importantly as the case manager
 
07:42:16.670 --> 07:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
I hold some responsibility and that's
 
07:42:19.490 --> 07:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
why I'm here for Desi today because Desi
 
07:42:21.890 --> 07:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
was being abused
 
07:42:26.270 --> 07:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
sexually by that one trusted adult
 
07:42:29.208 --> 07:42:29.218 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is Predators exist in
 
07:42:30.350 --> 07:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
our world today
 
07:42:33.548 --> 07:42:33.558 align:start position:0%
secrets are what predators rely on
 
07:42:37.310 --> 07:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately predators are going to go
 
07:42:40.850 --> 07:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
where they their resources are which is
 
07:42:43.910 --> 07:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
our school systems same thing with
 
07:42:46.490 --> 07:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
there's bad people in every profession
 
07:42:49.968 --> 07:42:49.978 align:start position:0%
you got 15 seconds to wrap it up so one
 
07:42:51.350 --> 07:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
of the things I heard a lot about today
 
07:42:54.530 --> 07:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
is we're criminalizing educators
 
07:42:56.690 --> 07:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
the other side is where criminalizing
 
07:42:59.628 --> 07:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
parents this is not okay this should not
 
07:43:01.548 --> 07:43:01.558 align:start position:0%
be about us and them we should be
 
07:43:03.770 --> 07:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
working together collectively and that's
 
07:43:06.170 --> 07:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
why we need a parental Bill of Rights I
 
07:43:08.628 --> 07:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
call it parents right parental right to
 
07:43:08.638 --> 07:43:10.128 align:start position:0%
call it parents right parental right to
know

07:43:10.128 --> 07:43:10.138 align:start position:0%
know
 
07:43:12.830 --> 07:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much
 
07:43:14.570 --> 07:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
you have a question you may ask your
 
07:43:16.850 --> 07:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um and
 
07:43:19.070 --> 07:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for indulging me you said that
 
07:43:21.770 --> 07:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
a school district put a child on
 
07:43:23.810 --> 07:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
hormonal medication without informing
 
07:43:25.910 --> 07:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
their parent where was this that's
 
07:43:27.590 --> 07:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
correct here in Concord New Hampshire
 
07:43:27.600 --> 07:43:28.990 align:start position:0%
correct here in Concord New Hampshire
when

07:43:28.990 --> 07:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
when
 
07:43:32.390 --> 07:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh less than Desi's been gone two years
 
07:43:37.010 --> 07:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
so uh 16 she started at 13.
 
07:43:39.230 --> 07:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
four years ago I don't I guess I'm I'm
 
07:43:41.208 --> 07:43:41.218 align:start position:0%
struggling to understand how a school
 
07:43:43.968 --> 07:43:43.978 align:start position:0%
district has prescription abilities this
 
07:43:47.090 --> 07:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
so on unfortunately the way our systems
 
07:43:49.310 --> 07:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
are working right now is through our
 
07:43:51.288 --> 07:43:51.298 align:start position:0%
behavioral health programs many other
 
07:43:52.968 --> 07:43:52.978 align:start position:0%
behavioral health programs in the
 
07:43:55.128 --> 07:43:55.138 align:start position:0%
schools are run by Planned Parenthood
 
07:43:57.288 --> 07:43:57.298 align:start position:0%
and they have the ability to give kids
 
07:43:59.810 --> 07:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
these prescriptions okay um thank you
 
07:44:03.530 --> 07:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
politician that I remember once said
 
07:44:05.830 --> 07:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
trust but verify
 
07:44:09.708 --> 07:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
and I don't say you're giving false
 
07:44:13.030 --> 07:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
information I'd like to have more direct
 
07:44:15.708 --> 07:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
documentation and if you could mail it
 
07:44:17.750 --> 07:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
to the committee I think that would help
 
07:44:20.448 --> 07:44:20.458 align:start position:0%
your testimony along so thank you for
 
07:44:23.628 --> 07:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
test testifying before us and the chair
 
07:44:36.350 --> 07:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:39.288 --> 07:44:39.298 align:start position:0%
good evening now thank you so much for
 
07:44:40.490 --> 07:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
your time
 
07:44:43.490 --> 07:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
my name is Eliza Tweedy I'm the
 
07:44:45.350 --> 07:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me pastor and First Church
 
07:44:46.788 --> 07:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
Congregational in Rochester New
 
07:44:46.798 --> 07:44:47.570 align:start position:0%
Congregational in Rochester New

07:44:47.570 --> 07:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
07:44:49.910 --> 07:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
I am also a mother of three all of whom
 
07:44:51.708 --> 07:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
have been educated in New Hampshire
 
07:44:53.390 --> 07:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
Public Schools
 
07:44:54.830 --> 07:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
one of the first things I learned as a
 
07:44:56.270 --> 07:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
parent is that my children are their own
 
07:44:58.730 --> 07:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
humans whether I like it or not
 
07:45:00.948 --> 07:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
my faith tells me that they are not my
 
07:45:03.048 --> 07:45:03.058 align:start position:0%
creation but Gods I have the privilege
 
07:45:05.270 --> 07:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
of guarding and caring for them but that
 
07:45:07.788 --> 07:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
is enough because through them I can see
 
07:45:10.010 --> 07:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
the fullness of God's creation who they
 
07:45:11.810 --> 07:45:11.820 align:start position:0%
are how they live their life may or may
 
07:45:13.910 --> 07:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
not follow my values or morals and
 
07:45:16.250 --> 07:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's okay because God's love is bigger
 
07:45:17.868 --> 07:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
than my understandings
 
07:45:19.788 --> 07:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
it is normal for a child to push back
 
07:45:21.230 --> 07:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
against their parents to create a sense
 
07:45:23.690 --> 07:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
of self separate from their parents to
 
07:45:26.030 --> 07:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
explore experiment and learn that is
 
07:45:28.430 --> 07:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
normal and natural and good for those of
 
07:45:29.810 --> 07:45:29.820 align:start position:0%
us who want our children to become
 
07:45:31.730 --> 07:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
members of society capable of critical
 
07:45:34.430 --> 07:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
thinking and thoughtful engagement if my
 
07:45:35.750 --> 07:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
children do not trust me enough to
 
07:45:37.250 --> 07:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
include me in their lives their
 
07:45:39.288 --> 07:45:39.298 align:start position:0%
questions and their Explorations that is
 
07:45:41.570 --> 07:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
a failure on my part to be a person that
 
07:45:44.208 --> 07:45:44.218 align:start position:0%
they trust that is a me problem
 
07:45:45.830 --> 07:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
when I was a young person there were
 
07:45:47.448 --> 07:45:47.458 align:start position:0%
many adults in my life who guided and
 
07:45:49.910 --> 07:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
loved me I could express to them my
 
07:45:51.708 --> 07:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
sense of self with less anxiety than I
 
07:45:53.390 --> 07:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
could to my generally very supportive
 
07:45:56.090 --> 07:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
and loving parents because losing that
 
07:45:57.770 --> 07:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
adult would have been less traumatic
 
07:46:00.048 --> 07:46:00.058 align:start position:0%
than losing my family and they gave me
 
07:46:02.628 --> 07:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
the courage to live into my truth they
 
07:46:04.670 --> 07:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
saw the image of God in Me and helped me
 
07:46:07.670 --> 07:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
see it in myself I want the same for my
 
07:46:09.468 --> 07:46:09.478 align:start position:0%
children and I am grateful to the
 
07:46:11.090 --> 07:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
teachers and other adults in their lives
 
07:46:12.530 --> 07:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
who have allowed them to become the
 
07:46:14.990 --> 07:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that they are becoming
 
07:46:17.868 --> 07:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
this bill does not speak as much to
 
07:46:19.968 --> 07:46:19.978 align:start position:0%
parental rights as it does to parental
 
07:46:22.670 --> 07:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
control it takes away a child's ability
 
07:46:24.288 --> 07:46:24.298 align:start position:0%
to explore their sense of self outside
 
07:46:26.270 --> 07:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
the family unit in ways that feel safe
 
07:46:28.368 --> 07:46:28.378 align:start position:0%
to them and whatever you want to believe
 
07:46:30.350 --> 07:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
this bill disproportionately affects
 
07:46:32.990 --> 07:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus students who may have been
 
07:46:35.150 --> 07:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
perfectly safe at home while closeted
 
07:46:37.430 --> 07:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
but will be targets of psychological
 
07:46:40.430 --> 07:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
emotional spiritually spiritual and
 
07:46:42.410 --> 07:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
possibly physical abuse if their
 
07:46:45.288 --> 07:46:45.298 align:start position:0%
identity is disclosed my faith tells me
 
07:46:46.968 --> 07:46:46.978 align:start position:0%
to stand firmly on the side of those who
 
07:46:49.548 --> 07:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
are most likely to be harmed the removal
 
07:46:51.468 --> 07:46:51.478 align:start position:0%
of safe spaces to be themselves is not a
 
07:46:53.150 --> 07:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
question of parental rights but of
 
07:46:54.948 --> 07:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
emotional spiritual and psychological
 
07:46:57.350 --> 07:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
control and you have 15 seconds to wrap
 
07:46:59.570 --> 07:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
it up yes sir it is correlated strongly
 
07:47:01.128 --> 07:47:01.138 align:start position:0%
with increased depression anxiety
 
07:47:03.590 --> 07:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation and self-harm which is
 
07:47:05.390 --> 07:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
not the outcome anyone wants for their
 
07:47:07.430 --> 07:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
children because of that first lesson I
 
07:47:10.368 --> 07:47:10.378 align:start position:0%
learned remains I can do my best to love
 
07:47:12.110 --> 07:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
my children and try to guide them but I
 
07:47:13.670 --> 07:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
cannot change who they are or force them
 
07:47:15.830 --> 07:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
to trust me I can only hope that the
 
07:47:18.110 --> 07:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
Beloved Community will I pray that there
 
07:47:19.368 --> 07:47:19.378 align:start position:0%
will be someone else who can see the
 
07:47:21.410 --> 07:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
fullness of God in my children until I
 
07:47:23.750 --> 07:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
can get out of my own way and see it
 
07:47:26.448 --> 07:47:26.458 align:start position:0%
myself thank you so much thank you so
 
07:47:26.458 --> 07:47:27.548 align:start position:0%
myself thank you so much thank you so
much

07:47:27.548 --> 07:47:27.558 align:start position:0%

Raymond Breslin we may have called him
 
07:47:32.390 --> 07:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
this morning and the card got back over
 
07:47:34.788 --> 07:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
here so if somebody else's name Raymond
 
07:47:37.030 --> 07:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
Breslin I guess not
 
07:47:40.128 --> 07:47:40.138 align:start position:0%
and we're getting to the end here
 
07:47:40.138 --> 07:47:40.750 align:start position:0%
and we're getting to the end here
um

07:47:40.750 --> 07:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:47:42.948 --> 07:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
Christine Perez
 
07:47:45.110 --> 07:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
do we have a Christine Perez we are
 
07:47:47.628 --> 07:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
Christine perezless
 
07:47:50.208 --> 07:47:50.218 align:start position:0%
was that
 
07:47:53.930 --> 07:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:57.650 --> 07:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
okay David Kendall David Kendall has not
 
07:48:03.930 --> 07:48:03.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:03.940 --> 07:48:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

07:48:08.390 --> 07:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:09.948 --> 07:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
good evening
 
07:48:13.548 --> 07:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
I was the 14 year old runaway homeless
 
07:48:15.230 --> 07:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
trans kid
 
07:48:17.270 --> 07:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
that has been referred to here many
 
07:48:18.948 --> 07:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
times today
 
07:48:20.570 --> 07:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
I'm torn
 
07:48:22.968 --> 07:48:22.978 align:start position:0%
because I'm a gay man
 
07:48:27.830 --> 07:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:31.128 --> 07:48:31.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:33.590 --> 07:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
I know that
 
07:48:35.330 --> 07:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
that place
 
07:48:37.910 --> 07:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
and so I'm torn
 
07:48:39.948 --> 07:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
but I'm not
 
07:48:42.110 --> 07:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
as torn
 
07:48:45.530 --> 07:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill
 
07:48:45.540 --> 07:48:47.330 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill
why

07:48:47.330 --> 07:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
why
 
07:48:50.090 --> 07:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
because I was a transgender woman for
 
07:48:52.868 --> 07:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
over 20 years I was a member of the
 
07:48:56.868 --> 07:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
lgbtqia gender movement for over 30
 
07:48:56.878 --> 07:48:58.250 align:start position:0%
lgbtqia gender movement for over 30
years

07:48:58.250 --> 07:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:49:00.530 --> 07:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
I have lived breathed and I have been
 
07:49:02.208 --> 07:49:02.218 align:start position:0%
this movement I didn't live a liar
 
07:49:04.010 --> 07:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
became the LIE
 
07:49:06.590 --> 07:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
with very graphic sexualized books
 
07:49:09.590 --> 07:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
making their way into schools
 
07:49:09.600 --> 07:49:11.388 align:start position:0%
making their way into schools
classrooms

classrooms
 
07:49:15.048 --> 07:49:15.058 align:start position:0%
you cannot tell me there's not an agenda
 
07:49:19.070 --> 07:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
digital and and um analyzers
 
07:49:23.448 --> 07:49:23.458 align:start position:0%
said nearly 350 K through 12 Educators
 
07:49:26.448 --> 07:49:26.458 align:start position:0%

07:49:34.310 --> 07:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:37.128 --> 07:49:37.138 align:start position:0%
parents must be the only ones making the
 
07:49:38.510 --> 07:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
decisions on whether or not their
 
07:49:40.548 --> 07:49:40.558 align:start position:0%
children are reading viewing or being
 
07:49:42.730 --> 07:49:42.740 align:start position:0%
taught about same-sex
 
07:49:47.270 --> 07:49:47.280 align:start position:0%

by scientists these are theories that
 
07:50:01.850 --> 07:50:01.860 align:start position:0%

Alfred Kinsey
 
07:50:07.208 --> 07:50:07.218 align:start position:0%

documented pedophiles documented
pedophiles

07:50:12.110 --> 07:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
pedophiles
 
07:50:14.030 --> 07:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
I have heard the parents after their
 
07:50:15.530 --> 07:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
sons and daughters have tried to take
 
07:50:16.670 --> 07:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
their lives
 
07:50:22.850 --> 07:50:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:24.830 --> 07:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
they've been secretly and aggressively
 
07:50:27.590 --> 07:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
been told by teachers and counselors
 
07:50:30.770 --> 07:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
that they will willingly hide crucial
 
07:50:30.780 --> 07:50:31.810 align:start position:0%
that they will willingly hide crucial
information

07:50:31.810 --> 07:50:31.820 align:start position:0%
information
 
07:50:34.670 --> 07:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
which only tells these children that it
 
07:50:38.628 --> 07:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
is okay to deceive to lie to and to hide
 
07:50:41.510 --> 07:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
things from their parents
 
07:50:43.788 --> 07:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
the parents are the sole decision makers
 
07:50:45.888 --> 07:50:45.898 align:start position:0%
when it comes to their children
 
07:50:48.288 --> 07:50:48.298 align:start position:0%
I was targeted
 
07:50:50.628 --> 07:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
I was groomed
 
07:50:54.410 --> 07:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
I was molested my entire childhood
 
07:50:57.110 --> 07:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
I ran away from home because I couldn't
 
07:50:59.090 --> 07:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
be trans
 
07:51:00.708 --> 07:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
and I lived on the Streets of
 
07:51:00.718 --> 07:51:02.330 align:start position:0%
and I lived on the Streets of
Philadelphia

07:51:02.330 --> 07:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia
 
07:51:06.948 --> 07:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:09.288 --> 07:51:09.298 align:start position:0%
I stay I sit before you a 50 year old
 
07:51:13.610 --> 07:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
gay man I'm LGB
 
07:51:16.070 --> 07:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
you've got 20 seconds to finish up I
 
07:51:18.830 --> 07:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
have osteoporosis which is an elderly
 
07:51:20.330 --> 07:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
woman's disease and I've had it before
 
07:51:22.490 --> 07:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
the age of 30. I've also been sterile
 
07:51:26.628 --> 07:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
since before the age of 30 30. so these
 
07:51:28.910 --> 07:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
are the concepts that are leading
 
07:51:32.750 --> 07:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
children into so much darkness and we
 
07:51:35.150 --> 07:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
need a medium because honestly I don't
 
07:51:37.010 --> 07:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
know whether to oppose
 
07:51:37.020 --> 07:51:37.670 align:start position:0%
know whether to oppose
yeah

07:51:37.670 --> 07:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:51:40.190 --> 07:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
or to affirm the bill
 
07:51:42.650 --> 07:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
because there's no medium and there

07:54:24.888 --> 07:54:24.898 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of committee my name
 
07:54:26.150 --> 07:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
is Richard head I'm the government
 
07:54:27.888 --> 07:54:27.898 align:start position:0%
Affairs coordinator for the judicial
 
07:54:31.010 --> 07:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
branch I come with a request for a what
 
07:54:33.468 --> 07:54:33.478 align:start position:0%
I think is a technical Amendment
 
07:54:35.868 --> 07:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
um and I'll reference both on the bill
 
07:54:39.310 --> 07:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
as introduced it's page 3 line 13 to 15
 
07:54:42.468 --> 07:54:42.478 align:start position:0%
in the amendment of the Amendments after
 
07:54:44.868 --> 07:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
if we go by the amendment it's page 4
 
07:54:47.230 --> 07:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
line 28.
 
07:54:50.750 --> 07:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and what I've handed out is the
 
07:54:53.150 --> 07:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment and then the second
 
07:54:55.128 --> 07:54:55.138 align:start position:0%
page of what I've handed out is the
 
07:54:58.430 --> 07:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
statute that is referenced in the bill
 
07:54:59.990 --> 07:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and I'll explain the reason why I'm
 
07:55:02.810 --> 07:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
asking for the amendment the statute so
 
07:55:04.670 --> 07:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
this section of the bill starts this
 
07:55:07.250 --> 07:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
section shall not and it identifies what
 
07:55:10.310 --> 07:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
that section does not apply to
 
07:55:12.770 --> 07:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
um and B is it the section shall not
 
07:55:14.270 --> 07:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
prohibit a court of competent
 
07:55:16.610 --> 07:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction law enforcement officer or
 
07:55:19.190 --> 07:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
employees of a government agency that is
 
07:55:20.930 --> 07:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
responsible for child welfare from
 
07:55:22.730 --> 07:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
acting in his or her official capacity
 
07:55:24.708 --> 07:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
what we're asking is that there be a
 
07:55:26.530 --> 07:55:26.540 align:start position:0%
period there because the rest of it
 
07:55:29.510 --> 07:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
would would result in this paragraph
 
07:55:31.968 --> 07:55:31.978 align:start position:0%
having no meaning because it then goes
 
07:55:33.410 --> 07:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
on to say within the reasonable and
 
07:55:35.150 --> 07:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
prudent scope of his or her authority
 
07:55:42.530 --> 07:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 186 119c 186 119c is a
 
07:55:45.468 --> 07:55:45.478 align:start position:0%
duty of the Department of Education so
 
07:55:48.230 --> 07:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
none of the none of the entities listed
 
07:55:49.910 --> 07:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
in this paragraph are the department of
 
07:55:52.850 --> 07:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
energy education
 
07:55:54.830 --> 07:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
um actually I'm sorry this is a school
 
07:55:57.770 --> 07:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
district obligation relative to the
 
07:56:01.190 --> 07:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education so because none
 
07:56:03.468 --> 07:56:03.478 align:start position:0%
of the entities including what I care
 
07:56:05.288 --> 07:56:05.298 align:start position:0%
about is a court
 
07:56:08.448 --> 07:56:08.458 align:start position:0%
has any duties under this statute they
 
07:56:11.150 --> 07:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
would never be acting pursuant to it so
 
07:56:13.368 --> 07:56:13.378 align:start position:0%
therefore this exception doesn't exist
 
07:56:16.190 --> 07:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
in it as it's written so what I'm asking
 
07:56:18.170 --> 07:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
for and I've I briefly spoke with the
 
07:56:20.990 --> 07:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
speaker and the representatives who
 
07:56:22.910 --> 07:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill about striking that
 
07:56:24.288 --> 07:56:24.298 align:start position:0%
I didn't think it was an issue and I
 
07:56:25.850 --> 07:56:25.860 align:start position:0%
don't think it is but I just wanted to
 
07:56:28.250 --> 07:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
flag it for you
 
07:56:30.590 --> 07:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
um it just simply gives the paragraph
 
07:56:32.270 --> 07:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
the meaning I think it was intended to
 
07:56:34.250 --> 07:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
have so this has nothing to do with
 
07:56:37.968 --> 07:56:37.978 align:start position:0%
ideology wearing a hijab belonging to a
 
07:56:40.490 --> 07:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
club this simply has to do with getting
 
07:56:43.310 --> 07:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
the statute cited right needed a little
 
07:56:45.708 --> 07:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
technical Amendment wow no position on
 
07:56:47.628 --> 07:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
the bill thank you thank you all right
 
07:56:49.250 --> 07:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
to anybody's knowledge is there
 
07:56:51.770 --> 07:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
something else I'm supposed to do
 
07:56:54.048 --> 07:56:54.058 align:start position:0%
is everybody with a pink card been heard
 
07:56:55.850 --> 07:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
yes have you sold all your girl scout
 
07:56:58.968 --> 07:56:58.978 align:start position:0%
cookies good okay we are now officially
 
07:57:04.730 --> 07:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:04.740 --> 07:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
um
