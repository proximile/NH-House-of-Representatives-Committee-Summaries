00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
quite a few more bits of input here and
 
00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:51.270 align:start position:0%
quite a few more bits of input here and
there

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
up to and including at 8 59 on sunday
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
morning when
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
matt called me so um
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
the document itself the amendment itself
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
i'll say is a compilation
 
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
of all the competing interests and as
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
everybody on this call is aware there's
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of competing interests in this
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
so what i tried to do is craft a
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
document or an amendment
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
that would uh hopefully make everybody
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat happy and i knew i couldn't
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
convince everybody to be 100 happy but i
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
to the document itself um i'll make two
 
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:29.749 align:start position:0%
to the document itself um i'll make two
quick

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
points uh a lot of input that i've
 
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.870 align:start position:0%
points uh a lot of input that i've
received

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
since the final one out uh the first one
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
is on
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
the april first date
 
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
or reporting that would be on page 2
 
00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:45.750 align:start position:0%
or reporting that would be on page 2
line

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
14. the document right now actually
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
shows august 31st that is not what
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
what went to ols and mickey can
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
chime in if he needs to but for some
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
reason it came back as
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
august 31st that is not what was
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
intended it was supposed to be april 1st
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
now i've heard had more input from
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
individuals about that being too far
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
down the road
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
the original hb2
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
date had january 1st of 2022
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
and quite honestly i'm not opposed to
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
that however i will emphasize
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
that the date in the current amendment
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
of april
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
1st is on or before
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
it's not on it's on or before which
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
means if the
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
commission were to come up with
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
something sooner than that they can do
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
it sooner than do it uh
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
you know immediately if they need be but
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
that date again
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
depending on how our discussions go
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
today we can talk about that
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh let's see the second issue
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
was uh i guess the
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
the name um a commission i i
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
i've heard several people mention they
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
want it to be called the coordinating
 
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.590 align:start position:0%
want it to be called the coordinating
council

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
and quite honestly i i don't really care
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
if it's called you know a committee
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
a commission a council you can call
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
whatever you want
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
call it potato or doorknob but you know
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
as long as basically the structure
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
the structure of this thing is to me
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
what's important
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
the reason i did the amendment main
 
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.030 align:start position:0%
the reason i did the amendment main
reason

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
was i i believe that the
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
the structure of it immediately setting
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
up a 15
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
member board of trustees was not
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
coming from somebody who has not seen
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
this issue really in the forefront in
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
public to begin with now that might
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
just be me i pay pretty much pretty good
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
politics and things going on in new
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire and it was new to me so i just
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
think the citizens of new hampshire
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
deserve a a look at this and that it
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
should be explored a little bit more
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
detail than
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
in putting it in hb2
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming everybody has had a chance
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
to look at it
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
um i can go through line by line if you
 
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
want i
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
i think it's pretty self-explanatory i'd
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer the questions on it
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh why i did things in it um
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know whatever you would like to do
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
chairman berger
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh mickey can you um
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
bring the amendment up on our screen so
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask andrea to do that real
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%

i'll bring it up on the screen just one
 
00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
i'll bring it up on the screen just one
moment

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
while she's doing that i will make one
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
other comment originally
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
the numbers that came back to me those
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
who supplied numbers were
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
seven and nine and then i will say at
 
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
some point
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
both uh university system in new
 
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.230 align:start position:0%
both uh university system in new
hampshire

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
and um community colleges in new
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire both
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh recommended a higher number and that
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
number ended up being what you see in
 
00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:34.230 align:start position:0%
number ended up being what you see in
there

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
okay um is there anyone that would
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
on on this
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh amendment that uh representative
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
turcotte put out
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um first of all i
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
thank representative turcotte because i
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
think he did an
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely outstanding job in
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
in putting together this amendment and
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
it accomplished
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that we that we wanted
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
what we saw in hb2 and um the
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
conversation that we're having now
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
and i i do also want to say that there
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
are reasons why we couldn't agree
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
and sign on to this amendment and
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
basically they were um
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
details about membership um time
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
around timelines about who the members
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
were so um they just were
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
a number of things and and in light of
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
that i want to just say number one
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
i find this is a far better step
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
um but we just don't feel it's enough
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
at this point but again i do want to
 
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:03.829 align:start position:0%
at this point but again i do want to
thank

00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
including uh an accreditor someone who
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
works with the regional
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
associations i think that's critical um
 
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.110 align:start position:0%
associations i think that's critical um
i

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
i know that barbara brittingham with um
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
the new england association i'm not sure
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
what the new name is called now
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
um but but might be somebody who who
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
could provide either a name or maybe
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
she'd even be willing to help out
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
um a representative from the 65 by 20
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
focus group
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
i think their work has has been um
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
pretty critical
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
and i think that's important and i think
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
they're really critical to the
 
00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:55.590 align:start position:0%
they're really critical to the
conversation

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
so um the original date was january 1st
 
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.629 align:start position:0%
so um the original date was january 1st
2020

00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
and we just really would like to see it
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
pushed out a little bit more
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
there are i believe about 11 unions
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
in this process and um just the
 
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.269 align:start position:0%
in this process and um just the
complexities

00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
complexities
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
of merging unions and all the details
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
that have to occur
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
i just think are going to take more time
 
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.470 align:start position:0%
i just think are going to take more time
um

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
the other issue that wasn't addressed in
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
is the issue relative to
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
um maintaining the separate budgets
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
and and i maybe we're going to deal with
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
that elsewhere
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
but i just think we need to be clear
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
that we we maintain
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
separate budgets for both entities
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
throughout this biennium and also
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
i hope that a consideration can be one
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
given to funding to support this effort
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
and then again two
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
that we provide funding um to support
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
the um level funding for both
 
00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:00.870 align:start position:0%
the um level funding for both
institutions

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
and finally i just want to say that um
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
i i have been very
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
upset about um
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
the dialogue that we've been having we
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
have underfunded
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
our university and community college
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
system for years
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
and i just they have struggled
 
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
they've had to raise tuition we have one
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
of the highest in the country
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
and much of this situation
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
is of our own doing we're not
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for the decline in
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment and many of these things
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
but the situations of the cost of
 
00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:42.069 align:start position:0%
but the situations of the cost of
tuition

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
that is particularly a burden that we
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
need to carry as legislatures
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
we have not done our due diligence for
 
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.590 align:start position:0%
we have not done our due diligence for
them

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
and with that i will be quiet i thank
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much representative
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
heath representative petry i believe you
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
were next
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you madam chair uh trouble
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
is the phone keeps ringing
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
over this issue some of it uh yeah uh
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
one of the problems i have is a date uh
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
i've discussed this with representative
 
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.949 align:start position:0%
i've discussed this with representative
turcotte

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
turcotte
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
you know we need to have something in
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
place uh
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
probably at least january
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
and the merger should be on its way by
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
the money situation uh keeping the
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
classes separate
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
i think that's another issue that uh i
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
i um mirror what um representative heath
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
just said and also the
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh the accreditation i think that's very
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
important as uh
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
representative heath also mentioned uh
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to work
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think the union situation uh 11 unions
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's going to happen whether
 
00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:58.950 align:start position:0%
i think that's going to happen whether
you

00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
put it out there five years ten years
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
two months i mean it's it's it's going
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
to be a a big issue and it's going to
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
have to be done
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
and we expect trouble from that i i
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
would assume
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
so maybe not so those are those the
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
issues i have uh
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know we we need to protect the
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh but we need to make it a nimble
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
organization when it's complete thank
 
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.230 align:start position:0%
organization when it's complete thank
you

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
turcotte yes thank you madam chair
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
um yeah just a couple comments on what
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
i've heard so far um
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
i i i think uh having lived through
 
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
several mergers
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh in my job and working for our pilots
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
union i can tell you that
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
the union issue is going to be a huge
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not going to belabor that
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
point um
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
keeping money separate uh totally agree
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
um the commission
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
the way it's set up it gives uh you'll
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
notice on i think it's page two there
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
begins a long
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
list of different things they should
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
look at but it's not limited to that
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
i would assume that that would be one of
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
the issues they would
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully take up again
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative petry mentioned january
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
and the last one representative heath
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned the funding of the university
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
community college system that yeah i
 
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:30.870 align:start position:0%
community college system that yeah i
mean

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
although that's a is an issue i guess
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's not the subject matter of this
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
amendment you know that to me is a
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
totally separate issue
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay um represent heath did you have
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
your hand up again
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
no ma'am here i just didn't take it down
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
representative murray thank you madam
 
00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:01.270 align:start position:0%
representative murray thank you madam
chair

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i really appreciate all the work
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
that representative turcotte did on this
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to do over the weekend with
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
everyone scattered around
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
but i need to echo pretty much
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
everything that um
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative he said there are other
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
things that i think are considerations
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
in here there's an odd uh
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
i guess it uh almost a paradox where
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
this is a committee um which would be
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
repealed at a certain time i think in
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
the last iteration it was june 20th
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
and the problem i have with that is that
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
i think this needs to be a longer term
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
however this committee works and
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
whenever we ask for
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
work uh results from this committee is
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
that this to me is more of a long-term
 
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.390 align:start position:0%
that this to me is more of a long-term
committee

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
where people have skin in the game where
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
some of the work that is done here not
 
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.029 align:start position:0%
some of the work that is done here not
just

00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for exploring and studying
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
and assessing
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
that i'd like to see that there are
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
people really involved there are other
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
issues some of them have already been
 
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.230 align:start position:0%
issues some of them have already been
mentioned

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
one i think mary representative heath
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
alluded to this a little bit
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
but one of the primary tasks
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
of this committee in going forward in
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
considering the merger
 
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
is to have an evaluation of the
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
different products that the um
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
both systems are
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
producing and also i think it'd be
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
important that one of the considerations
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
that they do when they're going forward
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
is to consider a sustainability model
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
for these um for the either one system
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
or the two systems
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
when the two systems might become one
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
system but to have a sense of
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
a real plan around sustainability so on
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
the one hand
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
it's i think that what's presented here
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
is a short
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
term kind of a bubble
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
which does not represent a lot of the
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
things that need to be considered in
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
here and i'm not sure
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
about having this committee and then
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
form another committee and then
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
i don't know where that goes from there
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
so there's just a
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
confusion to me about the way this
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
has been set up and the way what is
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
proposed to do
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
as opposed to what we had talked about
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
earlier of a committee that
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
is actually designed to do something
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
to you know take steps and to be
 
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.590 align:start position:0%
to you know take steps and to be
responsible

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
for those those steps so i guess those
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
are my concerns
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
um it is complicated and um i think one
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
of the things that we all agree on is
 
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.029 align:start position:0%
of the things that we all agree on is
that

00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
this this is going to take some serious
 
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.510 align:start position:0%
this this is going to take some serious
thought

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
and so this is why those are my
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you um
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
one of the uh things that was at i added
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
very late in the game was
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh on page three this on line two
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
um and that was uh making sure the
 
00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.270 align:start position:0%
um and that was uh making sure the
commission

00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
is aware of and uh takes into account
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
the final report of the study group for
 
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.830 align:start position:0%
the final report of the study group for
post-secondary

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
post-secondary
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
education that came out on march 19th uh
 
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
as i read through that the first six
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
pages was
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
was nothing but excellent excellent
 
00:23:19.919 --> 00:23:21.270 align:start position:0%
was nothing but excellent excellent
questions

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
without answers because of the timeline
 
00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.549 align:start position:0%
without answers because of the timeline
but

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
i think it uh just shows and illuminates
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
how many issues are out there many of
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
the issues that
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative murray and heath has
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned are in there
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
um and again the number of questions and
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions that are in there
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
just to me uh
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
highlights how important getting this
 
00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:45.269 align:start position:0%
highlights how important getting this
right

00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other thoughts or
 
00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:52.950 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other thoughts or
comments

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
on representative turcotte's
 
00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.710 align:start position:0%
on representative turcotte's
amendment

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
miss provencher you have a question
 
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.789 align:start position:0%
miss provencher you have a question
comment

00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and and um i
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
apologize if
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
if the work session uh is is intended
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
only for
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
representatives but i i just did have a
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
couple of comments
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
um we do agree with a a january first
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
date to reflect the urgency of the work
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
and the only other point i would make is
 
00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:29.029 align:start position:0%
and the only other point i would make is
um

00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
i would say a nine-member commission
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
may be better without the chief
 
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.710 align:start position:0%
may be better without the chief
executives

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
executives
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
from either system for a couple of
 
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.029 align:start position:0%
from either system for a couple of
reasons

00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
likely may be more nimble but also
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
the chief executives will likely be
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
coordinating the staffing of this
 
00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:54.070 align:start position:0%
coordinating the staffing of this
committee

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
working with that any external support
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
making sure that the committee
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
has what it's it our commission has what
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
it needs
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
to do its work and and the second part
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
um the ceos if
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte's amendment goes
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
forward would be responsible i believe
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
it's in this language
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
for being part of the search for a new
 
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.470 align:start position:0%
for being part of the search for a new
chancellor

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
chancellor
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
if indeed oh am i getting this mixed up
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
is that not in representative
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
i believe it's there okay they would be
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
for um uh choosing their replacement
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
and also the the new ccsnh chancellor
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
um will be trying to get his or her
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
feet on the ground and not have context
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
so and this new csnh chancellor may
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
also be interested if there were to be a
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
new chancellor position
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
in applying for that so um
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
my recommendation would be to to remove
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
the chief executive and
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay sorry
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh yes susan please go ahead thank you
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative on burger
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
um i respectfully disagree and would
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
really love to see whoever the
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
chancellor of the community college
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
system is serving uh
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
on this group given how we are organized
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
um i i don't know that this individual
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps if he or she wanted to be a
 
00:26:47.679 --> 00:26:48.950 align:start position:0%
perhaps if he or she wanted to be a
candidate

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
for the new search would belong on that
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
search committee
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
but i do think that this individual
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
would be in a place within the community
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
college system
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
to comment and to orchestrate the
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
resources that the committee
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
might need thank you thank you
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um and i guess i'm
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
confused about
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
dates here so i would like a little
 
00:27:14.559 --> 00:27:17.110 align:start position:0%
dates here so i would like a little
clarification

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
if this amen amendment passes
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
it would become effective
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
upon passage which should probably be
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
something around
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
july 1st given that this is the budget
 
00:27:30.159 --> 00:27:30.710 align:start position:0%
july 1st given that this is the budget
um

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
and if we are going until
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh april of 2022
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
that doesn't give a particularly long
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
period of time i don't think from july
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
to april to get this work done
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
am i am i reading it right are we
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
changing the date to april
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
first uh representative would you
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
mind answering that question please sure
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
um the date in the amendment
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
is supposed to read april 1st
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
2022. you can see the note there on your
 
00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.190 align:start position:0%
2022. you can see the note there on your
screen

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
again somehow it came through as august
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
31st i think that's because somewhere
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
else in the document it uses that same
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
date maybe i'm not sure but
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to be april 1st um
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
again that is a date
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
was think of it almost as a compromise
 
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.510 align:start position:0%
was think of it almost as a compromise
state

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
i was hearing from one side that it
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
needed to be
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
into the fall of next year some people
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
were saying you know keep it at january
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
1st whatever
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
and i want to emphasize again what it
 
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.470 align:start position:0%
and i want to emphasize again what it
says

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
on or before that means if there are
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
individuals who think this commission
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
can get legislation uh up and running
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
april 1st that could be november of this
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
year it can be
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
december it can be january 1 then that
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
can happen
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
it's on on a before date like i say i
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
was trying to
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh in this amendment to cover try to be
 
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:05.510 align:start position:0%
uh in this amendment to cover try to be
as

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
uh accepting of everybody's comment as
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
possible to make it a
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
a document that everybody could you know
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
right right thank you it's just it just
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
seems like the list of things that they
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
answer and investigate is lengthy
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
and as you mentioned representative
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
turcotte that report that came from the
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
education committee had many many
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
questions to
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
probe and find answers to and i just am
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
again it's just as a little too
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
brief a period of time to do that work
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
well but i might be underestimating the
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
ability of the members of that committee
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
to work effectively together so
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
i think that um one of the things that
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
uh obviously
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
anyone that decides to go on this
 
00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:00.870 align:start position:0%
anyone that decides to go on this
committee

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
or yeah needs to be dedicated to making
 
00:30:04.399 --> 00:30:05.669 align:start position:0%
or yeah needs to be dedicated to making
sure

00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
that all of this stuff gets done
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know they can't sit around for
 
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.190 align:start position:0%
you know they can't sit around for
months

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
contemplating whether they should use
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
their left hand or their right hand
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
they have to get directly down to
 
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.070 align:start position:0%
they have to get directly down to
business

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that the work
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
that the education committee did
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
is a is a very helpful
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
tool for them to begin to
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
focus on the kinds of things
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
that that need to be done
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
and that um they that
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
will need to make sure that
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
this is not just well yeah i need to go
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
on the committee because
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that the um
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh the trustees or would the chairman
 
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.310 align:start position:0%
uh the trustees or would the chairman
whoever

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
whoever
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
would um explain this
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
to anyone that was selected for the
 
00:31:18.159 --> 00:31:19.350 align:start position:0%
to anyone that was selected for the
committee

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
i know people think we're rushing it
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
um i know people think
 
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.789 align:start position:0%
um i know people think
that

00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
we won't be able to give it what needs
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
given i think that's one of the reasons
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
why hopefully
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
in hb2 we will have the 1.5 million
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
in there to assist the study committee
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
because it is a huge task
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely no question about it
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
and um i think that the
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
um the outside
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
group coming in will also hopefully
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
help to focus
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh this committee
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
and um you know what
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
what the right number of people are
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
is is hard to say whether it's
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
9 15 or 20
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
and i think that representative heath
 
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
probably made
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
a very good point that
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
um someone if we can find
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
someone from what's it called
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
the accreditation people and i know they
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
at least i'm not sure that they need to
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
be on the committee
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
but they certainly need to be involved
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
with whatever decisions might be made
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
on this combining of the
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
of the two of the two systems
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
um the 65 by
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
25 group
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
um i believe has outlined
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
in great detail what
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
what they are looking for
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
in the um
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
education and i i really
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
i really believe that that is uh that's
 
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.350 align:start position:0%
i really believe that that is uh that's
important

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
and again i'm not sure that
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
they need to have a vote but they need
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
to be there
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
for uh consultation
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
because i think all of us agree that
 
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
none of us have a
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
complete understanding
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
of what's going on
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
at both the university and the community
 
00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:17.430 align:start position:0%
at both the university and the community
college

00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know the the community college
 
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.710 align:start position:0%
you know the the community college
trustees

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
trustees
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
are familiar of course with how
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
they operate and the unh
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
or the the university system trustees
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
are knowledgeable about
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
their operation so it's um
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
initially i think there's going to be
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of trying to understand
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
what the other system is doing
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's not like they don't have
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
neither group has the um
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
advantage of having heard not just
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
this discussion okay
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
but for many of us over the years
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
we have learned a lot
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
about the operation of both
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
systems and um so
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's just just a a comment okay
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
um uh representative turcotte
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
you have uh yeah i hope you don't mind
 
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.710 align:start position:0%
you have uh yeah i hope you don't mind
uh

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
i just hear things along the way that
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to comment in regards to the
 
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.349 align:start position:0%
i'd like to comment in regards to the
amendment

00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
uh please absolutely yeah thank you
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
um somebody mentioned uh about the
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
selection of chancellor i forget who was
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
i apologize but
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
on the third page line seven it actually
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
speaks to that it won't be an
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
individual uh or two looking to select a
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
chancellor that will be the
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
the job of the commission itself so
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
that would be the 11-member commission
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
as to the number of members again i'll
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
repeat that
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
i receive every request from anything
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
from seven to fifteen
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
um i i think i think eleven is actually
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
a very good number
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know um the the commission will have
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
the ability
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh not only to hire um necessary
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
consultants but i'm assuming the
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
committee the commission if they're if
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
you have a great commission they are
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
going to be using the
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
or at least getting input from as many
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
sources as as required
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
um i i'm unfamiliar with the 65 by 20
 
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.349 align:start position:0%
um i i'm unfamiliar with the 65 by 20
group

00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think you know getting an accreditor
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
involved is absolutely
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
a great idea um but but i'm just a
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
little hesitant to
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
start putting too many chefs in the
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
kitchen if you will
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
um i think a dedicated group of 11
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
is better than a maybe a a less
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
dedicated group of 15 or 21 or whatever
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
odd number you want to
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
throw in there and i
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh oh on the date back to the april
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
twentieth day one of the representatives
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
again i forget
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
who mentioned that um the april first
 
00:37:25.839 --> 00:37:26.390 align:start position:0%
who mentioned that um the april first
date

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
would be a little too quick however i
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
would suggest
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh you review the the the uh amendment
 
00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:34.550 align:start position:0%
uh you review the the the uh amendment
that

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
has bit you'll be proposing i think a
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
little bit later
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
that has a date on it of january first
 
00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.710 align:start position:0%
that has a date on it of january first
2022

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
2022
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
also so just something to keep in mind
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay is there any further discussion on
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte's amendment
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh represent murray thank you again i
 
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.349 align:start position:0%
uh represent murray thank you again i
just

00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
had a it just occurred to me i had a
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
question or comment
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
um that you know the search committee
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
selected the chancellor i think you know
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
fine idea to have the search committee
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
select the chancellor
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
but um you know this committee is
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
repealed at some time later in the year
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
and i have not seen a situation where
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
one could
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
search and select a chancellor in
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
that short of amount of time that's
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
usually a big
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
job taking i hate to say it
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
often a year to get that kind of a
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
position filled so
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
that also the timeline is a concern to
 
00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:33.670 align:start position:0%
that also the timeline is a concern to
me

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
um i agree that they should be the ones
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
to select the chancellor
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
but again i don't see that um being a
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
realistic timeline
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
just from my experience in that regard
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much so uh
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
could we uh andrea switch to
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative um he's
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
amendment absolutely give me just one
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.839 --> 00:39:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
problem

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
welcome to the group troy i understand
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
hey thank you yeah i did i had a little
 
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
bit of trouble
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm actually just pushing up on my other
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
screen for the uh
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
okay well good i'm glad that uh mickey
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
was able to help you
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
navigate this whole thing so and uh and
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
by the way welcome to division two and
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
um just
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit um if you have
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
comments or questions we raise our hand
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
and i will um take those in
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
order of who raised their hands first
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
second and third
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
and so that just uh works a lot better
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
for us i think
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative heath i don't see
 
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.270 align:start position:0%
okay representative heath i don't see
you

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
on my screen but i know you're there in
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
here and
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you madam chair i first of all
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
i just want to again
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank um representative turqart and
 
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.670 align:start position:0%
thank um representative turqart and
secondly

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
um as i said previously
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
the pace at which this whole thing is
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
happening is troubling
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
and the report from house ed i think
 
00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:36.230 align:start position:0%
and the report from house ed i think
further

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh explains the
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
multitude of questions why so the
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
is really to study the unification
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
of of the university and community
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
college systems
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
and it just defines the members
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
and again it may it it holds true the
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
date of 2022
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
but this is more of a committee um and
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's simply
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
to look at the process slow down the
 
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.910 align:start position:0%
to look at the process slow down the
process

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
and to make the determination
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
quite frankly as whether or not
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
this is action that should be taken
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
should should the um
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
process go forward um with
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
the unification of
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
the two systems together what the pros
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
what the cons are
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
we have not done the details of
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
elaborating all of this
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
we would leave this to this group and in
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
truth this
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
amendment certainly needs tons more work
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
but we wanted just to come forward with
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
that we felt slowed down the process
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
um kept the conversation open
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
but really investigated the report
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
provided to us
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
by house education and and distinguish
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
the the order in which
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
things are going to happen will in fact
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
take place
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and in fact we would
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
like um consideration
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
for this simply as a simple proposal
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
to say let's talk about this
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
let's use a report from house ed and we
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
don't have some of that language in this
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment and again i say this
 
00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.430 align:start position:0%
this amendment and again i say this
amendment

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
needs much more working consideration
 
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:34.470 align:start position:0%
needs much more working consideration
but

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
a simplification of a process not going
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
in with the predetermined
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
concept of this is a done deal and that
 
00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.190 align:start position:0%
concept of this is a done deal and that
we

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
are going to move forward forward with
 
00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:46.550 align:start position:0%
are going to move forward forward with
the

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
merger um this is more of a conversation
 
00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.390 align:start position:0%
merger um this is more of a conversation
about

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
should we move forward to have this
 
00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.069 align:start position:0%
should we move forward to have this
conversation

00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
and um i look to my colleagues
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative murray and
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
yes representative murray please thank
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
um yeah i think there's been so
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
there is so much information out there
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
we've received a lot of information
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
and in our time frame it's been
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
impossible at least for me
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
to go through all that information and
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
to make some of these determinations on
 
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:24.870 align:start position:0%
to make some of these determinations on
this

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
i i'm just overwhelmed with and
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
appreciative but overwhelmed
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
of all the information that i've been
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
receiving um
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
i've certainly been on the phone with
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
some people
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
and they're different perspectives on
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
this but i think there is agreement that
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
something needs to be done
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
and this at least provides a little bit
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
more breathing space
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
um i wish we could just go right ahead
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
now you know and you know get digging
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
our heels hop in the saddle and you know
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
get some of the work done
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
but i think that there's so much
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
information to sift through
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
it makes me uncomfortable to try to be
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
the one to decide which way this should
 
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.670 align:start position:0%
the one to decide which way this should
go

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
um so i prefer this amendment
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
i would say that i would like that these
 
00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.510 align:start position:0%
i would say that i would like that these
members

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
to continue in the work because i do
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
believe strongly that whoever is
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
involved in this
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
has to be responsible for where this
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
goes has to be responsible for
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
the um the work that gets done they need
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
as i said before
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
they need to have some skin in the game
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
but i think this gives a chance
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
even perhaps you know for public
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
hearings to just to hear
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
from more than what we've already heard
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
from and to have a chance to go through
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
the myriad of documents that have been
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
sent my way not that i would necessarily
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
be on the committee
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
but the the documents that have been
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
sent to us that
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
we simply have not had a chance to
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
really review i do want to say i
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
think that something needs to be done i
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
don't know what that
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
is and i would hope to see that this
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
committee can maybe put
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
some a schematic a plan something in
 
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.270 align:start position:0%
some a schematic a plan something in
place

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
to help navigate how this is going to go
 
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.870 align:start position:0%
to help navigate how this is going to go
forward

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh represent porter were you next
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
i i don't know madam chair
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay thank you i'm just going
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
to say that i reiterate what um both
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative murray and representative
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
heath have said
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
my main concern with this whole thing
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
was the speed that it was happening
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
um seemed overwhelming to me and
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this amendment i
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
understand is to slow things down a
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
give another group a chance to dig into
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
this and come back
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
with a with information that will help
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
move the thing forward um
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the what representative
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
turcotte did i think it was very
 
00:45:51.359 --> 00:45:52.710 align:start position:0%
turcotte did i think it was very
comprehensive

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
um i just think this one slows things
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
down a little bit and gives us some
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
breathing room so we make sure we
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
can get it right when we do it so that's
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to let just say
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative petry
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair um you know
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
i think this would be still kicking a
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
can down the road i think the education
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
community did a fabulous job in putting
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
their study together
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
i think we have some good ground work
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
that we can work with
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh if we push this out to another
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh another biennium i think that's
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
what's gonna happen and it's gonna get
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
pushed out again and before you know it
 
00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.430 align:start position:0%
pushed out again and before you know it
you're

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
you know it won't happen and uh we'll be
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
oh did you want to say something else
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
represent murray
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you just then i think you
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
know uh my
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative petry is making i
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
think a very good point of not kicking
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
this down the road i think you know
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent we've already been
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
doing that and so what i'm hoping from
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
this group is that this
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
is a group that will take the take the
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
bull by the horns
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
look at what needs to be done and
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
actually start working on this process
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
we just i don't think in a way know how
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's going to look
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
but i you know my hope is that they
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
won't kick it down that they will have
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
they will take the responsibility and
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
get working on this now
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
mary uh represent heath you indicated
 
00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.230 align:start position:0%
mary uh represent heath you indicated
that

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
um this amendment was not ready for
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
prime time is that correct
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
it does indeed need more detail and more
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
focus but i just want to emphasize the
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
fact that the real purpose of this
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is to create a study
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
committee not a merger committee
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
i think that we've got to take the time
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
to look at all the things that need to
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
be taken into consideration and i really
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
think house ed
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
formulated the questions that need to be
 
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.430 align:start position:0%
formulated the questions that need to be
asked

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
asked
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
and i think if we could spend six months
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
um that would would give us some time
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
to to really think about what we're
 
00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:31.829 align:start position:0%
to to really think about what we're
doing

00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
and move forward thoughtfully um right
 
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.589 align:start position:0%
and move forward thoughtfully um right
now

00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
i just i'm really concerned
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
that we're moving forward without doing
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
the the due diligence that we need to
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
do for the purposes
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
and and for the souls and missions of
 
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:52.549 align:start position:0%
and and for the souls and missions of
either

00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
of each one of our institutions it's
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
it's a big
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
step um and somebody's going to
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
lose missing elements of their programs
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i just want to make sure that we've
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
deterred and done the least harm
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
that we can possibly do and to try to
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
make this a win-win situation
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
for both entities i would love to see
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
the university and the community college
 
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.710 align:start position:0%
the university and the community college
agree

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
on steps to move forward right now i'm
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
feeling like
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
there were concerns um deep concerns
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
on the part of the community college and
 
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.069 align:start position:0%
on the part of the community college and
and

00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
truthfully we have
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
the our workforce to look at i i think
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
that the community colleges serve
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
a serious purpose in our state
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
and i just don't want to compromise
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
either entity so i just think we need
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
a lot more time so i just thank you
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh you're quite welcome um
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
so if um
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
if you thought or think this amendment
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
get some more clarity to it when could
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
you have this back
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
to us um
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
i would say um today is tuesday
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
um we could have something
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
i think if we work together
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
this evening we could probably pull
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
something together
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
you're making me nervous
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
i agree um we'll try to have something
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
by tomorrow
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative turcotte
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
yes uh there were several suggestions
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
that were made
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
to adjust the amendment that you
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
produced and
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
um and in some cases you said it really
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
didn't matter to you
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
which way it went that's correct okay
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
so um do you think you could refine
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
your amendment to
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
um make those
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
adjustments by tomorrow
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely i can have that done by
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
this afternoon as long as i
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
know specifically i heard a bunch of
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
adjustments and i heard a bunch of
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
competing adjustments that the one that
 
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.069 align:start position:0%
competing adjustments that the one that
i'm

00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
i was going to mention that i think i
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
will do
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
and that will be to change the uh
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
the april first date to january 1st that
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
seems to be
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh i know that for some people it moves
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
it up quicker
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
but looking at representative heath's
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
again that would only be a um study
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
they had the same data in that so i i'm
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
not opposed to doing that
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
i still believe april first is fine but
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
i i can do that
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
and the only other i'm trying to go
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
through the issues that were brought up
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
um really the only other one i heard was
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
the potential from
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
for adding an accreditor 65 20 or
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
something like that but i also heard
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
opposing views
 
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
and i think i stated that i mean
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
the the commission is going to have the
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
ability to hire consultants do what they
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
want and
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
i got to believe they those individuals
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
the accreditor and the 6520 will
 
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
certainly be able to have the
 
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.990 align:start position:0%
certainly be able to have the
opportunity

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh to give their input and hopefully the
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
commission requests it so
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
if there was something else in there
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
that i missed that
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
individuals all agree on that needs to
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
be in there i'm not opposed to change
 
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.390 align:start position:0%
be in there i'm not opposed to change
that

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
i just have to have that actually
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
delineated to me so i know
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
but but the way i'm looking at it right
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
now i'm
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
is the date if there's something else
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
just let me know
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
the um the number of
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
people okay and this is
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned if i'm not mistaken
 
00:53:33.119 --> 00:53:33.670 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned if i'm not mistaken
that

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
um you wanted two legislators on that
 
00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.750 align:start position:0%
um you wanted two legislators on that
committee

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
and um i would
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
prefer that those two people come from
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
because we as a legislature are going to
 
00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.150 align:start position:0%
because we as a legislature are going to
get

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
our opportunity
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
to review that and
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm not i don't know that you
 
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.549 align:start position:0%
um i'm not i don't know that you
mentioned

00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
yes you did the higher education
 
00:54:04.559 --> 00:54:06.309 align:start position:0%
yes you did the higher education
committee

00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh that they would report to us
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
every month i think it was or every
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
other month
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
that i believe that that's where
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
the legislative input will
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
come from because the people
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
on on that committee uh
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
focus only on higher education
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's their uh that's their
 
00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.790 align:start position:0%
that's that's their uh that's their
purpose

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
and so from my perspective
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
i would um eliminate the legislators
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
from that and there are two reasons for
 
00:54:45.359 --> 00:54:46.470 align:start position:0%
from that and there are two reasons for
that

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
time okay availability maybe the
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
maybe the right term is availability in
 
00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:57.829 align:start position:0%
maybe the right term is availability in
that

00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
um sure over the summer we are probably
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
more available than we are right now
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
but as we start getting into september
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
october and november
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
our availability drops off
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
and so um you know we can't
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
in my opinion we can't have
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
a a person on this
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
committee that isn't
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't have the time to get
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
dedicate to it
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
and that's just you know that's my
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
my feeling i don't know how anyone else
 
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
thinks about that or not but
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
um what i would ask i guess ask a
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
question on that one would
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
on this you're you're stating a
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
preference to eliminate the two
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
the the one pres uh appointed by the
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
senator uh the president of the senate
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house keeping the
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
committee at 11 and changing those two
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
my initial thought is would it be a
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
better option in your opinion
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
to actually change the number on the
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
committee to 13
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
keep the two appointments from the
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
senate and
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
house of representatives and simply add
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
two more or do you think
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's just better to eliminate the two
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
i personally think it's better to
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody else has a comment on i
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
was going to say does anybody else have
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
the silence is deafening
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
okay if if those are the only two issues
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
like i said i
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
can have an amendment uh very quickly or
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh fix change this amendment very
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
quickly that's not a
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
huge amount of issues
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um would there be
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
an issue with the timeline
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
had if this is moving back to january
 
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.150 align:start position:0%
had if this is moving back to january
1st

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
1st
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
2022 but the this commission is supposed
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
to work
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
to find a chancellor
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
is that enough time i believe that as
 
00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:47.589 align:start position:0%
is that enough time i believe that as
written

00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
um no that wouldn't be an issue uh what
 
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.630 align:start position:0%
um no that wouldn't be an issue uh what
the

00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
january first date would be is for the
 
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
commission to actually
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
um produce legislation
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
whereas the chancellor uh have to find
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.839 --> 00:58:08.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
commission cells serve as the committee
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
to elect a chancellor or to select a
 
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.109 align:start position:0%
to elect a chancellor or to select a
chancellor

00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
chancellor
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
i have to look at it more that would not
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
be the intent the intent would be
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
for the legislation to be put forward uh
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
if there
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
is going to be any um on january 1st
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
but the if this commission would not uh
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
go away until a much later date which
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
looks like the 31st or something of 2022
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
so they would have an additional amount
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
of time to do that
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
um and i i suppose in fact in the
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
legislation put forward they could even
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
delineate hey now we should also uh
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
select a chancellor so i don't see that
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
as an issue if somebody has a better way
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
for me to word that i'm
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
yes i am sorry that's okay
 
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
it took me a minute to take myself off
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
mute well
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
yeah fine what we need to do is try to
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
find the buttons
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
so um generally
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
we are not calling these people trustees
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
in in this amendment
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
so would these folks would really not
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
have any authority to hire
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
a new chancellor and like
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
well well they would if it's in the law
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
neither amendment forms a new um
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
integrated board right it it
 
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
one forms a commission and one forms a
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
study committee but but neither
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
forms a new board if you will
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
normally a board would hire the
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
chancellor but if
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
the legislation says this commission
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
would then i
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
would guess that that provides the
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
authority to hire
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i just don't want to get
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
cross-wise with
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh to representative turcotte's earlier
 
01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:41.990 align:start position:0%
uh to representative turcotte's earlier
point

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
though remember that this commission
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
working over a six-month period
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
reporting i believe monthly
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
to the yes monthly to the public higher
 
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
ed study committee
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
and then recommending legislation
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
by january 1st of 22
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
that legislation could change that
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
authority i suppose if it was the will
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yeah to that
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
point exactly
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
again if you read on page three of the
 
01:01:21.599 --> 01:01:22.390 align:start position:0%
again if you read on page three of the
amendment

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
line seven the commission sells shall
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
serve as a search committee to select a
 
01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.549 align:start position:0%
serve as a search committee to select a
chancellor

01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
chancellor
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
once legislation has been submitted
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
once it's been submitted should the
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
commission recommend a single chancellor
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
so it that that line right there i
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
believe takes
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative murray
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i have a real problem
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
taking the
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
power to hire a chancellor
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
away from the university system i think
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
to me that's a bit of an overreach
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
the university system and the community
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
college systems
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
should be the ones to hire their own
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
chancellor so that's a
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
well the only i guess i would say of the
 
01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.390 align:start position:0%
well the only i guess i would say of the
11

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
11
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
members of this commission
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
eight do come from
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
the community college system in the
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
university system
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
i will to representative murray's point
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
that this is unusual
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
that a a commission would
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
um engage in in a search
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
but but frankly the whole the whole
 
01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.190 align:start position:0%
but but frankly the whole the whole
discussion

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
is is um you know unusual we're thinking
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
about the future of public higher
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
education in new hampshire
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
for you know the next number of decades
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
so i i guess it
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
it does without some kind of authority
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
let's just if you please if i think
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
through the timing
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
let's say this legislation introduced in
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
that that would let's just keep playing
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
this through so then maybe there'd be a
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
new board established july 1st of 22
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
if it were to be passed and adopted then
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
there's going to have to be integration
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
plans and all of that
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
and then the board is going to have to
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
engage in a search for a chancellor
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
so now we're probably out until
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
6 9 12 months later before there were
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
chancellor now
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
i suppose if again if you play this out
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
a new board could hire an interim
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
chancellor while there was a search
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
but you know the idea to get a
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
chancellor in as soon as possible
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
if this is going to move forward is the
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the the best thing that
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
that could be done to actually start
 
01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:20.630 align:start position:0%
that could be done to actually start
integration

01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
integration
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
if if it's determined that that's the
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative heath
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
you know thinking of this
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
it almost seems premature
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
to hire a chancellor um
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
and not having
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
the university system and the community
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
college system
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
um be those driving
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
that process concerns me greatly but
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
truly what this project what this
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
process will need
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
is more of a cfo or um
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
a person who is an engineer of how to
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
make this
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
work because it may i i
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
don't think it would be a chancellor
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be a temporary
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
um person to bring in place
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
and they would have the authority to
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
but ultimately i don't think we want
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
that person
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
to be the long-term chancellor i think
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
we need
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
someone that what i guess what i'm
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
we really need a project manager to iron
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
out the details
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a horrific process
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
when you think of
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
all the details that have to take place
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
so i just think we have to be careful
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
about jumping to a chancellor
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
susan yes thank you representative
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
on berker um the
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
i think it was the last time that this
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
group met i
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
talked about the fact that we are going
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
forward with a search for
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
a chancellor with a two-year contract so
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
the community college will have
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
leadership in place at least through uh
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
july 2023
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
and we chose that particular date
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
because that matched
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
the original language that had come from
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
the governor's office
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
i agree with kathy's laying out of the
 
01:06:26.079 --> 01:06:27.750 align:start position:0%
i agree with kathy's laying out of the
timeline

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
and also agree with the representatives
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
who are
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
making the point that the board should
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
be hiring the chancellor
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
so i only say this to give you an
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
indication that the community college
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
has people in place
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
that can continue to lead through
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
whatever the transition
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
process is
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
so if i'm understanding you correctly
 
01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:50.950 align:start position:0%
so if i'm understanding you correctly
susan

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
susan
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
you would recommend that the university
 
01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
system hire a chancellor for
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
a two-year that
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
the board of trustees right now should
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
go out
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
and try to hire someone for a two-year
 
01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.150 align:start position:0%
and try to hire someone for a two-year
period

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
the same as the community college system
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
did am i
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly no ma'am i
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
would not presume to tell the university
 
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.430 align:start position:0%
would not presume to tell the university
system

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
what to do i'm purely speaking about
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
what the community college system is
 
01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.069 align:start position:0%
what the community college system is
doing

01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
we go back to some of my original
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
statements very different
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
missions so my comments are only
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
about the community college system thank
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to clarify
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
oh come on you you're leaving in june
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
so let's stick our necks out okay well
 
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.109 align:start position:0%
so let's stick our necks out okay well
yeah

01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
not you know even if i weren't leaving
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
in june that is not
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
a block that i wish to put my neck up on
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
but thank you for that questionable
 
01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:53.990 align:start position:0%
but thank you for that questionable
opportunity

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
now i it you know this is we go back to
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
what so many people are saying this is
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
very very important and i'm going to be
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh parochial and represent the interests
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
of the community college and say that
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
we're in a place where we can go forward
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
with whatever change it is the
 
01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:13.750 align:start position:0%
with whatever change it is the
legislature

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
recommends and still have leadership so
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
that our system of seven
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
is intact what the university system
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
wants to do
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
is for the university system to figure
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
so before we before we uh
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
realized that
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
that we're uh we're not going to put our
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
necks on the chopping block
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
um kathy what do you think
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the concept of
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
your board or your trustees hiring
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
someone for a two-year period
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
and then lynn i will get to you
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's my board's intention
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
to hire someone we
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
we for a two-year period we have a
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
transition plan in place right now the
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
duties of the chancellor have been split
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
between myself and president dean
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
i believe that that will be my board's
 
01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:26.229 align:start position:0%
i believe that that will be my board's
approach

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't drink coffee uh represent
 
01:09:32.839 --> 01:09:34.309 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't drink coffee uh represent
turka

01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
turka
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
yeah um once again i'd like to read the
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh language from line seven on page
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
three i think this
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
discussion unfortunately is a little bit
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
off into the weeds
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh maybe i should start with the last
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
part of it first
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
should the commission recommend a single
 
01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.510 align:start position:0%
should the commission recommend a single
chancellor

01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
chancellor
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
the commission shall serve as a search
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
committee to select a chancellor once
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
legislation has been submitted so this
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
is up totally
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
to the to the uh decision of the
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh commission that's being put together
 
01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:07.750 align:start position:0%
uh commission that's being put together
um

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
so i i think the discussion it's okay
 
01:10:11.199 --> 01:10:12.149 align:start position:0%
so i i think the discussion it's okay
but

01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
i think that sentence kind of takes care
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
of everything people are looking for
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
what line was that representative it's
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh line seven on page three of
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
we have no consensus if that's the right
 
01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.750 align:start position:0%
we have no consensus if that's the right
term

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
on how we should go
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
option one is use the governor's
 
01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:05.590 align:start position:0%
option one is use the governor's
language

01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
as it is option two
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
is to use the turcotte um amendment
 
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
make some adjustments and option three
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
is to use the representative he's
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
amendment with some changes
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
it would it would seem to me
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
that even though i had
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
hoped hoped that we could come to some
 
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh conclusion today and actually
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
take a vote on something that we're not
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
there yet
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
and um i just
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know we're not there
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.189 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
do we have to have a
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
finalized amendment before we can vote
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
a draft amendment that would be sent to
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
ols once we do our voting
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's up to you as as chair of division
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
two we've done it both ways in the past
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
so if it's a
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
a couple edits to a document that
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
already has been drafted and the
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is the motion would be to
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
vote on an amendment with you know this
 
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:50.470 align:start position:0%
vote on an amendment with you know this
amend

01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
amend
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
this edit this edit to be drafted by uh
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
our office and bring back to the
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
committee later we could do that
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's up to you okay
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
so if we decided to do that
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
we could perhaps make that
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
process a little quicker in other words
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
maybe instead of thursday
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
we could come back to wednesday
 
01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.110 align:start position:0%
we could come back to wednesday
afternoon

01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i i my sense is we would be able
 
01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.550 align:start position:0%
i mean i i my sense is we would be able
to

01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
i could work with representative
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative heath and we could turn
 
01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.229 align:start position:0%
representative heath and we could turn
around

01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
amendments for tomorrow based on today's
 
01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.149 align:start position:0%
amendments for tomorrow based on today's
discussion

01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
if based on tomorrow's discussion and
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
those amendments you wish to make tweaks
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
and vote on it we could probably get get
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
through that and do that uh tomorrow
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
kathy you have your hand raised
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
i think you're much closer together than
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
than it might appear uh representative
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
heath's amendment has five five and five
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
members and representative turcottes has
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
four four and three and representative
 
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
turcotte's amendment
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
it sounds like was going to change the
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
date to january 1st
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
which is the date in representative
 
01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
which is the date in representative
heath's

01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
heath's
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
so it just it seems it seems like you're
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
much closer than it might appear
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh yes i don't
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
i don't disagree with that it's just a
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
question of
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
how how we want to frame
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of where where i am
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
so uh representative heath
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that we can have
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
people outside the legislature
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
without a commission i think that's
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
kind of how we frame that so
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
all right yes sorry madam chair
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
that but that that needs to be a
 
01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.350 align:start position:0%
that but that that needs to be a
commission

01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
okay i you know and i know that just
 
01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:22.550 align:start position:0%
okay i you know and i know that just
from

01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
years of experience with that i didn't
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
even think of that
 
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you we all have
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh we all have
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
things that we don't tend to remember
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
like um like dates and so on
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
um all right i think we will
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
end this discussion on these two
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
amendments unless there
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
is someone else that has
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
comments or questions
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none we will end this
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
mickey oh there you are
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
um is there anything else that
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
we could do today
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
i i don't think so um we're compiling
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh what should hopefully be the uh
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
last set of amendments proposals from
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're gonna try to get all that compiled
 
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.030 align:start position:0%
we're gonna try to get all that compiled
today

01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
and then uh by the end of the day today
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'll have
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
distributed to everyone it will post
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
online the amendments for discussion for
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and potentially thursday if we
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
leak into thursday
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh so as far as today i don't have
 
01:16:50.159 --> 01:16:51.350 align:start position:0%
uh so as far as today i don't have
anything

01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
new we we made a we made we're very
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
productive yesterday to
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
to get a lot of things off of our plate
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
and i think the
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
the final actions at this point for
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
division two are to be the
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
ones for um longer discussions for
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and like i said we're still
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
okay um i got a
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
update from um representative weiler
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
last night
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh it appears that the full finance
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
march 30th okay
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 2. and also
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
it appears that the presentation
 
01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
to the um legislatures
 
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
legislators is going to be
 
01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh that should be in the calendar that
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
comes out
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
um this week again you know those are
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
our dates that we talked about uh
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
as i said yesterday things can change
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
and but as i as i learn anything new
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
i will certainly
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
keep you up to date on that
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
so is there
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
that you know i can't believe we got
 
01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:31.510 align:start position:0%
that you know i can't believe we got
this

01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
not even 11 30. um we probably could
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
have gone on for
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
hours on this discussion as we have but
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
i really thought that it was better just
 
01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.229 align:start position:0%
i really thought that it was better just
to

01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
let us move forward with uh with these
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
two amendments
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
and we'll see what happens uh
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
no isn't that sad i just remember
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair i was looking at the list we
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
worked from yesterday
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
and when we were talking about the
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
running start program um the dual
 
01:19:08.239 --> 01:19:08.950 align:start position:0%
running start program um the dual
enrollment

01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
we had another amendment that we were
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
not sure whether
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
funding was going to go for implementing
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
for money needed to run the program
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
and i was just wondering if that's
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
something we have to re right
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
is that another amendment i just i
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
should just ask mary but i'm going to
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
ask you
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's okay um we will be
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
discussing that tomorrow okay marjorie
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
um i uh there is
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
um i think we had mentioned about
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
um moving the running start
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
for dual and concurrent enrollment
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
into the uh community college and
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
letting them manage the program
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
yes we did we did that yesterday but
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
then there was
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
a question of whether from the funding
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
right thank you and so yeah and so
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
at least i have a plan if that's the
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
right term
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay whether or not everyone agrees with
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
it's a different story but
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
we i have a plan to put um
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
would we say mickey a million yes
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
a million each year into the uh
 
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
dual and concurrent enrollment so
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's what
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
that's in the works yeah i hated to
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
leave that little thing up in the air
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
no no i uh
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'll put it this way you know there
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's some things that
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
i am really fervent about and that
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
happens to be one of them
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
so um you know a lot of
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of other things so what
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know but but that is a that is a
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
program that has
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
really helped a lot of a lot of students
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
and um i know
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
kids that are graduating early from high
 
01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:10.709 align:start position:0%
kids that are graduating early from high
school

01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
because of the dual and concurrent
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment program
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
and then they are going on to you know
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
to college
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a great program so i'll be
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
quiet about it
 
01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
shannon on this
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay so 10 o'clock tomorrow morning
 
01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
and um hopefully we'll
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh get through the things that we need
 
01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.189 align:start position:0%
uh get through the things that we need
to

01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh mickey do you have a comment no
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to add that this is
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
crunch time so if there are any
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
amendments anything you want to fund in
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
house bill one or reduce in house bill
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
one or add in house bill two or take out
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
anything so now's the time to get them
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
into me and we'll put them on our
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
working documents for
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
the rest of the week uh
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
one other thing that we have is
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
sb 82
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
and um mickey do we need to
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
take that up before we close out the
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
budget or
 
01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:20.870 align:start position:0%
budget or
after

01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's funding for
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
21. yeah it's um it's
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's actually essentially you can
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate the money and spend it any
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
time but the
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
nature of that bill is to provide
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
payments that were based on
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal 20 and fiscal 21 kindergarten
 
01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.110 align:start position:0%
fiscal 20 and fiscal 21 kindergarten
programs

01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
so if you recall how the adequate
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
education formula works
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
there's a year behind uh lag really in
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
student accounts for the payments made
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
so what happens is for districts that
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
start a brand new kindergarten program
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
they don't actually see the full
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
adequacy for those kindergartners until
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
the following year
 
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
senate bill 82 would seek to
 
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
provide the money for the back years for
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal 20 and fiscal 21 for those first
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
two years that we were doing full
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
kindergarten adequacy
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
so we have a fixed number it's about two
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
million dollars that would cover all
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
that uh senate bill 82
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
passed the senate and has been referred
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
to finance we haven't had a public
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
hearing on it so
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
there was a similar provision in house
 
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill 623
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
that we retained and it would be up to
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
the committee if you wanted to add
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
language of
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 82 into your budget proposal
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
and and the funding
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
okay so we would just um
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
we would not yeah we would just
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
incorporate the idea
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
into the budget is that what i'm hearing
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
you say into hp2
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
yeah we could put an amendment in house
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
bill 2. it would just be carried as a
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
surplus statement adjustment to
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
recognize the
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh spending that deal we would make in
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
accordance with those sections and there
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
is a there is appropriation language in
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
senate bill 82 as well to make it clear
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
how much
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
is for this purpose okay
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
so when you have it when you have an
 
01:24:06.639 --> 01:24:08.629 align:start position:0%
so when you have it when you have an
opportunity

01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh please take a look at uh at that bill
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
and um see what uh what the thoughts are
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
so representative heath i think you were
 
01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:19.189 align:start position:0%
so representative heath i think you were
first

01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
i am thank you very much madam chair and
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to say
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
that in reference to that bill that we
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
just discussed
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%

01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
