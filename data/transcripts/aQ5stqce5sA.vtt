do my best to give you all a good
 
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
outlook for what the u.s economy is set
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
to do there you hopefully see the full
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try and give you a gross
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
overview of the u.s economic outlook for
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
the next couple years uh bearing in mind
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
that the outlook that i'm going to give
 
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
you today is very different than the
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
outlook i might have given you maybe
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
three or four weeks ago before the
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
russian invasion of ukraine so i
 
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the the serendipitous
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
delay in this uh because again the the
 
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
outlook has changed quite a bit i'm also
 
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
going to uh basically
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
present to you what our our baseline
 
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
outlook would have been pre-invasion and
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to try and layer a few um
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
risks and changes to the outlook based
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
on the invasion
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
as as a result of that um i'm going to
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
try and be as brief as i can and allow
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
you to ask questions as well
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
when i finish up i'll be happy to answer
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
any questions the committee might have
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
i'll also hint a little bit at some of
 
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
the the outlook that we have for the
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire in general i know
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a lot of speakers
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
later today who will speak directly to
 
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
the the situation there in new hampshire
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
but i'll try and lead into those as best
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
i can okay
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
now i know that some of you have seen me
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
speak before at uh events for ncsl or
 
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
other events
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
but if you haven't seen me speak before
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
i do have to give a small disclaimer at
 
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
the beginning of my presentation so
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
my name is dan white for the record i'm
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
a senior director of economic research
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
at moody's analytics which is an
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
entirely separate company from moody's
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
investor service which is the ratings
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
agency that you might be familiar with
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
so the investor service is the ratings
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
agency movies analytics we are an
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
economic consulting and risk management
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
firm uh and so please don't let anything
 
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
that i say be misconstrued as having any
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
bearing whatsoever on past current or
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
future ratings actions uh if that sounds
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
like it was written by a lawyer it's
 
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
because it was but it keeps me out of
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
trouble as always have to do it before i
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
give my presentations okay
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
so with that out of the way let's get to
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
the economics so the first thing i
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you all is
 
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
a really a 30 000 foot view of the
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
economy kind of going into the last few
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
weeks so this is what we would you'll
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
hear me talk about this a lot is our
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
february baseline forecast
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
what that really means in practice is
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's our pre-invasion forecast so this
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
is our forecast um based on the economic
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
fundamentals going into
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh the month of february uh i think it
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
gives some pretty good context around
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
where we've been in the last two years
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
and kind of where we would expect to go
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
all else equal again remembering that
 
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
right now in the world all else is not
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily equal so the pandemic
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
recession was really incredible it's
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
we've kind of run out of synonyms for
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
unprecedented so we lost 22 million jobs
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
in basically a period of two months at
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
the outset of the pandemic which is
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
something that we've never even come
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
close to before
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
the good news if there is any about a
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic is that it's very different
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
than a normal recession it's not uh to
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
use an analogy it's not like a car a
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
normal recession's like a car that ran
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
out of gas for example so it takes a
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
little while for it to get all the way
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
to the bottom and then once we restart
 
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
it it takes a little while to get going
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
again with the pandemic recession this
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
is more like an electric car that just
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
got unplugged we fell off a cliff almost
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
immediately in two months
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
there were non-economic factors
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
obviously the shutdowns and the kogan
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
restrictions that prevented people from
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
going to work we lost 22 million jobs
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
almost immediately
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
the good thing is though again we plug
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
it back in and we gained almost 10
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
million jobs back within a matter of
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
just a few months so by the end of that
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
summer we had a much more shallow
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
recession than we had originally
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
experienced it took us a little while if
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
you remember back a year ago heading
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
into the winter time in 2021
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
the vaccines hadn't quite come out yet
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
there was still a second wave of covet
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
coming around
 
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
it was kind of a scary place as we moved
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
sideways for a few months but once the
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines came online
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
once we started to lift a number of the
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
coveted restrictions and just as
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
importantly once we started to get a lot
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
of federal fiscal stimulus kind of
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
rolling through the economy we saw the
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
recovery pick up in earnest that's more
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
or less what we saw for most of last
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
year in 2021
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
so much to the fact that the federal
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
reserve was able to start beginning to
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
normalize monetary policy at the end of
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
last year you see this fed begins
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
tapering qe
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
qe is quantitative easing so it's
 
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.310 align:start position:0%
qe is quantitative easing so it's
basically

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
they weren't necessarily tightening
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
monetary policy at that point but they
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
were they took their foot off the
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
accelerator so to speak
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
that brings us to more or less where we
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
are now which is the first quarter of
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
2022 we just had a very strong jobs
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
report come out this morning for example
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate fell down to 3.8
 
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
and so now this has really cleared the
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
decks and allowed the federal reserve to
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
begin to normalize monetary policy in
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
earnest now there are a number of other
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
reasons why the federal reserve is going
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
to be normalizing monetary policy and
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
earnings that we'll talk about in just a
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
minute uh most notably inflation
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
but that's kind of where we are where we
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
expect to go now and i've kind of laid
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
these two kind of mile markers out ahead
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
of you
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
so that you can kind of gauge the risk
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
going forward um is the feds going to
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
begin to normalize interest rates at
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
their march meeting we expect to have
 
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.069 align:start position:0%
their march meeting we expect to have
four

00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
rate increases in this calendar year so
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
before december we'll expect them to
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
raise rates by a quarter of a percentage
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
point four times
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
um by the end of this calendar year we
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
would expect to be back around full
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
employment okay
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
so as a mile marker if we get to the end
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
of 2023 and a majority of economists are
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
not saying that we are back full
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
employment then we know that something
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
is going wrong with this forecast
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
if for whatever reason we hit full
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
employment ahead of time then we know
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
that something is going very right with
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
this forecast
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to give you these as kind
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
of mile markers along the way to kind of
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
gauge the risk that's associated with
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we're actually
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
about to talk about
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
now you may be saying that this is a
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
very sanguine forecast in light of
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
what's happened over the last several
 
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.230 align:start position:0%
what's happened over the last several
weeks

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
and you would be absolutely correct so
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
this is our february baseline forecast
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
um this is not our our post february
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
baseline forecast so our post invasion
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
forecast is quite a bit different and
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about that going
 
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.590 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about that going
forward

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
so one of the reasons behind the how
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
optimistic this forecast was and some of
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
the things we have going for
 
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:35.810 align:start position:0%
are um really some incredible um
 
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:36.949 align:start position:0%
are um really some incredible um
[Music]

00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
artifacts of the pandemic from an
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
economic perspective
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to leave this chart up
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
here for a second because it bears very
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
close scrutiny um when our team here at
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
moody's actually first showed me some of
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
this data
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
i thought they calculated it wrong
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's how kind of incredible it is so i
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
made them go back and do it again and
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
the data was absolutely correct so what
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
you're looking at here this is what the
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
federal reserve calls household
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
checkable deposits and currency so in
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
practice what that means is this is
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
money that is sitting in individuals
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
checking accounts their savings accounts
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
they're liquid money market accounts
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
within their banks this is all the cash
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
that people have on hand
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
so this it comes from the federal
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
reserve we have data back to about 1990
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
and you can see that in a normal year
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
especially in the last 10 years or so we
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
would expect for there to be somewhere
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
between a half a trillion and a trillion
 
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
dollars sitting in people's bank
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
accounts kind of aggregate over the
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
course of the or throughout the rest of
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
the country
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
as of the end of 2021 we're sitting at
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
about three and a half trillion dollars
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
in cash just sitting in bank accounts
 
00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:43.190 align:start position:0%
in cash just sitting in bank accounts
right

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
so there's some good things here and
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
there's some bad things here the good
 
00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:47.590 align:start position:0%
there's some bad things here the good
things

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
are that there's a lot of
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
demand kind of sitting on the sidelines
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of cash out there that can
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
be flowing towards greater economic
 
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.470 align:start position:0%
be flowing towards greater economic
activity

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
the bad thing is that by sitting in bank
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
accounts this money is basically sitting
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
in the least productive place possible
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
from an economic standpoint so
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
um if this money were being spent it
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
would have obviously a much greater
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
economic impact if we're being invested
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
in more long-term assets as opposed to
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
sitting in bank accounts it would be
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
having a greater economic impact what
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
this is really an artifact of is the
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
fact that people just have a lot more
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
cash than they did
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic one the two
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
they're still very hesitant and very
 
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
cautious about what to do with that cash
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's so much uncertainty going on in
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
the world as a general
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
but especially in terms of financial
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
markets that folks are just really
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
putting this money in their bank
 
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.470 align:start position:0%
putting this money in their bank
accounts

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
now the um
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
the one thing to keep in mind here is
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
that we don't have very good insight
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
from the federal reserve about whose
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
bank accounts this money is sitting in
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
we don't know if this is just sitting in
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
elon musk and jeff leaders bank accounts
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
or this is pretty equally distributed
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
across the income distribution
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
anecdotally we we have a good sense that
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
most of this is sitting in what we would
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
term middle income
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
bank account so for 40 000 to
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
150 000 range in terms of the
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
income distribution
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
the reason being that if this was in
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
very wealthy households bank accounts it
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be sitting in a
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
savings account it would be sitting in
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
probably something that's a bit more
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
sophisticated from an investment
 
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.590 align:start position:0%
sophisticated from an investment
standpoint

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
however a lot of this also could be
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
sitting across relatively low income
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
folks households what we expect to see
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
is this is an artifact of
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
folks who maybe had never had much money
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
in their savings account before they now
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
have five thousand ten thousand dollars
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
sitting in a savings account either
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
because they didn't spend money during
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
the pandemic or um they've been able to
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
bank away a lot of the federal funding
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
or the federal assistance that's come
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
their way over the course of the
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic either way this money is not
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
going to sit in bank accounts forever
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of really the the key to
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
the next part of the recovery of the
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
economic expansion is where does this
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
money eventually go
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
and how quickly does it go how quickly
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
does it get out of bank accounts
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
now the other question that a lot of
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
people ask with this is kind of where
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
did the money come from
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
some of it is because folks pulled back
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
on spending during the the pandemic
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
but a lot of it is also the amount of
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
federal assistance that came to their
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
their households via the the pandemic
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
relief funds
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh and so it's it's important to look at
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
where we sit in the united states with
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
regard to that federal stimulus in other
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
countries around the world
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
this chart i think is very instructive
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
um in that it shows really how much more
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
we have done in the united states in
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
terms of federal fiscal stimulus than
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
other developed countries around the
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
world uh almost twice as much as most of
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
our our more
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
developed neighbors and competitors that
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
we have around the world
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
and i also want to point out that all of
 
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:44.300 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.750 align:start position:0%
the the
[Music]

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
stimulus you see here so the dark blue
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
is the cares act that was passed at the
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
initial part of the pandemic
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
we've got the december 2020 package
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
which um unfortunately didn't come with
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
a cool letter name so we just call it
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
the december 2020 package
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh apologies you do
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
economists are always really terrible at
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
naming things so we call the december
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
2020 package your american rescue plan
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
which you remember was last march that
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
came in shortly after the biden
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
administration came into office about
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
1.9 trillion dollars and then there's
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
about 550 billion dollars on the
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill that was just past
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
oh gosh a few months ago so all of this
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
aid that you're seeing here stuff that's
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
already been passed this doesn't account
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
for anything that might continue to try
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
to be passed in some kind of form of a
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
build back better bill or any other kind
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
of reconciliation bill that might be
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
considered in congress this year
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
now when we show this when i show this
 
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
chart around the country especially in
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
political audiences
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
i i kind of can see that it's a bit of a
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
political rorschach test in that about
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
half of the folks that i show this to
 
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.910 align:start position:0%
half of the folks that i show this to
say

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
well this is great you know this is why
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
the u.s economy is doing so much better
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
than everybody else and this is proof
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
that we should be spending more on
 
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
federal stimulus
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
and then i have about the other half of
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
the room you can immediately tell is
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
saying well that's way too much money i
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
can't believe we spent so much more than
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
all these other states or all these
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
other countries
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
we should really stop spending so this
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
same chart can be different things to
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
different people um and they're both
 
00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:15.909 align:start position:0%
different people um and they're both
right

00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
mostly because the the u.s has done much
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
better than a lot of other developed
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
countries coming out of the recession
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
as a result of the amount of federal
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal stimulus that we've had
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
the other part of this is that the
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
amount that we have spent is going to
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
have and is having additional economic
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
consequences throughout the u.s economy
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
and will have it consequences for a
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
number of years to come
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't take
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
we see what's going on with the economy
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
the economy's done better because of
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
this fiscal stimulus but it doesn't take
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
a phd in economics to figure out what
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
the results of this kind of spending is
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
if you take seven trillion dollars and
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
you you are about five and a half
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
trillion dollars and you shove it
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
through the u.s economy over a very
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
short period of time
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
the the end result is going to be at
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
least some inflation and we're starting
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
to see that um in earnest in the last
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
few quarters
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
now i want to emphasize again that what
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here is the pre-invasion
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
forecast so this is a february forecast
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
we'll talk a little bit about how this
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
forecast has changed in a minute but
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
even even before the uh russian invasion
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
of ukraine uh we expected to see
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
inflation stick around for quite a bit
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
in 2022 so we really didn't get back
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
down in the pre-invasion forecast to
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
what we would call relatively normal
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
levels of inflation you know two and a
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
half to three percent until the very end
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
of calendar year 2022
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
now we did see it coming down pretty
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
significantly there mostly as a result
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
as you can see this blue line dark blue
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
line that's the 10-year treasury yield
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
that's a result of the federal reserve
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
raising interest rates and trying to
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
squeeze some of that excess demand out
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the money markets
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
and trying to tamp inflation down quite
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
a bit
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
the russian invasion of ukraine has
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
obviously turned this on its head a
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
because we've had the realization of two
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
very significant risks to the economy
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
now the
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
table that you see here this is what we
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
kind of call our risk matrix
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
and what it is it's on the y-axis here
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
we have the likelihood of some of these
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
risks coming to fruition
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
and then on the x-axis we have the
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
severity of that shock so how important
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
would that be to the economic outlook
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
how much damage would it potentially do
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
to the outlook and you can see that two
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
of the most damaging and most likely
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
shocks to the outlook the pre-invasion
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
outlook have taken place in a very short
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
um first of all is a geopolitical event
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
obviously the the russian invasion of
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
ukraine um presents some amazing
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
uncertainty into the economic outlook
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
and so the shock and the subsequent
 
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.630 align:start position:0%
and so the shock and the subsequent
sanctions

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
sanctions
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
create that uncertainty for businesses
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
and households and when there's
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
uncertainty in the economy markets have
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
a tendency to have difficulty reacting
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
but also businesses and households
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
really have difficulty reacting that and
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
making long-term economic decisions and
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
when businesses in economic and
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
households have trouble making long-term
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
economic decisions that's a recipe for
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
much slower most more cautious economic
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
growth going forward
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
the other part of this is that the
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
supply disruptions and the uncertainty
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
from all the sanctions and from the
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
actual conflict itself they cause price
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
pressures to remain in place over a
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
substantially longer period of time and
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
i think that's important to talk about
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
when we look at the new inflation
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
forecast we don't have inflation
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily spiking much higher than we
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
are currently at but we have prices from
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
price gains remaining much higher for a
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
much longer period of time and that can
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
be just as if not more damaging than
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
very sharp spikes up in inflation
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
so what you're seeing here are three
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
different kind of scenarios for what we
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
would expect to happen as a result of
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
the conflict in ukraine
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
um the first line you're seeing this
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
blue line that's the february baseline
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
for the headline
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
cpi consumer price index
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
that's akin to the chart that i showed
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
you earlier and you can see that by the
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
end of 2022 pre-invasion we had expected
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
that to get back down into more normal
 
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.190 align:start position:0%
that to get back down into more normal
levels

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
levels
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
there are two kind of
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
scenarios that we think are most likely
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
here though there are you know almost an
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
infinite number to calculate at this
 
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.270 align:start position:0%
infinite number to calculate at this
point

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
the green line that you're seeing there
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
that's what we call a rapid resolution
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
and by rapid we mean probably six to 12
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
months we come to some kind of a
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
cease-fire or a tentative truce in in
 
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.870 align:start position:0%
cease-fire or a tentative truce in in
ukraine

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
ukraine
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
um where the sanctions maybe stay
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
most of the sanctions begin to stay in
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
place for a significant period of time
 
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.590 align:start position:0%
place for a significant period of time
but

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
not all of them some of them will come
 
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.710 align:start position:0%
not all of them some of them will come
off

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
the reason that
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
we would expect obviously to see much
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
higher inflation over that time period
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
is that those sanctions remain in place
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
some of the the energy and commodity
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
price increases that we're seeing now
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
will remain high for some time and so
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
that leads to much higher inflation for
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
a longer period of time
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
when we when all is said and done for
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
our march forecast this green line is
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
likely to resemble what our baseline
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
forecast is or what we would expect is
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
most likely to happen
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
remembering that trying to handicap the
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
outcome of an invasion of a sovereign
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
country is something that's very
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
difficult to predict
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
the orange line that you're seeing here
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
this is if there's a more lengthy
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
conflict so this is um the hot war in
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
ukraine continues for some time
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
um and sanctions either have to remain
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
in place or they have to be elevated
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
even further beyond what they've already
 
00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:38.950 align:start position:0%
even further beyond what they've already
been

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
imposed not just by the united states
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
but by the rest of the
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
most of the rest of the western world
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
what we would expect under this
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
situation is for energy prices in
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
particular to spike over the summer
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
and energy prices and most commodity
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
prices to remain relatively high for a
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
significant period of time
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
um this is not necessarily the worst
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
scenario but it's probably the worst
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
likely scenario
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
there are obviously so much darker
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
scenarios that we could go down not just
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
from an economic standpoint but from a
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
just a global standpoint
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
we haven't entertained too many of those
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
yet through our models but this is
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
something that would be particularly
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
damaging to the u.s economy because as
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
you can see we not only have inflation
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
sticking around for much longer but we
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
have it sticking around at a very high
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
rate so you'd see you know seven percent
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
plus inflation for the better part of
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
the year not getting back down to what
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
we would call a normal range of
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
inflation until the end of 2023.
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
that could create a very very difficult
 
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
environment for us to operate in
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
economically because not only would we
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
have inflation in creeping higher and
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
higher but we would have a federal
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
reserve that would have to react to that
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
higher inflation by potentially slamming
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
on the brakes a bit harder with terms of
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
monetary policy so they probably have to
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
raise interest rates much faster and
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
they would probably have to raise
 
00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
interest rates to a much higher point in
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
order to keep this inflation in check
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
by doing that when they stop on the
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
breaks of the economy in order to get
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
inflation in check they're going to be
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
slowing overall economic growth
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
so this is what that translates to in
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
terms of u.s real gdp growth you can see
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
we ended 2022 at about four percent gd
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
or sorry 2021 at about four percent gdp
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
growth um the blue line again is the
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
pre-invasion baseline kind of what we
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
would have expected a slow
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
cooldown in the pace of economic growth
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
but still very healthy by historical
 
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.110 align:start position:0%
but still very healthy by historical
standards

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
the green line which is that rapid
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
resolution which will again be probably
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
become our baseline
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
in march
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
that has the slowdown
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
much quicker
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
into a lower level but still
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
not necessarily unhealthy by historical
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
standards and then we would ramp back up
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
once that rapid resolution kind of
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
clears up and some of the sanctions
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
begin to go away
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of a lengthy conflict
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
this there's a lot of uncertainty about
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
what this would do to gdp growth
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
but at a minimum it would be a severe
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
slowdown in the u.s economy possibly
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
even a recession um
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
going from five percent to you know less
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
than one percent growth in um in one
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
year even if it's not technically a
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
recession can sure feel like a recession
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
to the average business or average
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
household and so
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
that's a much darker scenario that
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully we don't have to go down but
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the the key to this and
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
then the worst thing that could happen
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
is we have this decrease in growth we
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
have a contraction in the economy at the
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
same time that we have prices going up
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
for those of you old enough to remember
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
that looks a lot like the late 1970s and
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
the early 1980s in the united states and
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's a term that we call stagflation so
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
anytime that the us economy is starting
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
to stagnate we're starting to either
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
slow significantly or actually contract
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing prices start to
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
continue to go up considerably that's
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
stagflation and it's one of the worst
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
scenarios that we can we can see from an
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
economic standpoint
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
because it does require some very very
 
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.549 align:start position:0%
because it does require some very very
um

00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
aggressive action by the federal reserve
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
which can choke off growth for quite
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
some time
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
um so now that i've thoroughly bummed
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
you all out with those uh slides and
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
those scenarios i do want to give you
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
one or two other things to kind of keep
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
an eye on so that you can gauge kind of
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
which of these three scenarios we're
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
kind of finding and what we would need
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
to get out of this kind of a
 
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.549 align:start position:0%
to get out of this kind of a
forecast

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
forecast
 
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
so the the question i'm asked most often
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
by um by legislators by policy makers is
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
what can i be keeping an eye on to tell
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
kind of really
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
how tight the labor market is where we
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
are in the economic recovery and without
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
pause i always tell folks that they
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
should be watching something called
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
epoch now epop is kind of a wonky thing
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
that mostly only economists look at but
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh especially when we're we're looking
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
labor market that's so unique and so um
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
unprecedented that we're seeing today it
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
can be difficult to gauge where we are
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
in the economic business cycle just by
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
looking at something like the
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate the unemployment rate
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
is 3.8 today however that's not
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily a true
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
picture of the labor market because
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
we're still missing a lot of people from
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
the labor market who were part of the
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
labor market before the pandemic and
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
have pulled out so what we look at is
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
e-pop e-pop is the specifically we look
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
at the prime age epoch which is the
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
working age population so the number of
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
people who are employed in the united
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
states as a share of the number of
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
people who are age 25 to 54
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are not 25 to 54 i
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
promise you i didn't come up with the
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
name prime age that comes from the bls
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of prime workers who
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
are above 54 under 25 i know that but
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
that's what they look at here so what we
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
see in the um the data is that any time
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
that this is the blue line this is all
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
workers united states anytime this blue
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
line is above 80 percent
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
the us is probably in some kind of
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
really strong economic expansion we
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
usually can date the top of the business
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
cycle by how this number peaks out so
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
you can see in the early 2000s
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
this peaked out at about 82 percent
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
we had the 2001 recession this came back
 
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.029 align:start position:0%
we had the 2001 recession this came back
down

00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
we had another very strong business
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
cycle 2007 this peaked at above 80 and
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
then we obviously had the great
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
recession which pulled this way far down
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
it really took us a really long period
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
of time um during that the recovery from
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
the great recession um there's a lot of
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
people that say the great recession was
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
followed by the not so great recovery
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
and you can really see it when you look
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
at these kind of data
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
just before the pandemic however at the
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
end of 2019 is when we started to get
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
back above 80 percent again
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
and obviously we saw a huge decline in
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
primate g-pop as a result of the
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic and all of the the business
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
restrictions that came around the
 
00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:49.830 align:start position:0%
restrictions that came around the
pandemic

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
we have since seen that recover quite
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
significantly and in the last few months
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
we've seen it really pick up as more and
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
more states have dropped their business
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
restrictions we've dropped more masking
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
requirements and more vaccination
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
requirements that's allowed some more
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
people to come off of the sidelines for
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
various reasons into
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
the labor market and so now we're seeing
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
what we would normally assume is a very
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
late stage recovery and into an economic
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
expansion so again all else equal you
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
know take russia out of it for a minute
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
we see an exceptionally strong labor
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
market right now probably getting to
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
about the peak of what we would call
 
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
full employment which is why when i
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
showed you that pre-invasion forecast we
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
expected um the prime age or sorry the
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
full employment to occur sometime this
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
those numbers vary a little bit for men
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
and women i won't get too much into
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
those details unless somebody has
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
questions but
 
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm bringing this up
 
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
especially for new hampshire is that the
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
labor market in particular and the labor
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
force is an area that new hampshire
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
seems to stand out significantly from
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country as a result of
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
the the pandemic and i'll show you this
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
data here
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
um this is the overall size of the labor
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
force so these are the number of people
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
who are working or actively looking for
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
work in the u.s and in new hampshire and
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
you can see that they did peak out uh in
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
the at the beginning or sorry the end of
 
00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.909 align:start position:0%
the at the beginning or sorry the end of
2019

00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
2019
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
um and then with the pandemic they they
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
fell quite precipitously
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
when we look at this data and i've
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
indexed this to february 2020 so the the
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
number 100 would be equal to the level
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
that they were at just before the
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic began
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
and what i want to point your attention
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
to most is this kind of last six to nine
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
months here in 2021 where the u.s labor
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
market is our labor force has continued
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
to steadily recover and more people have
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
flowed into the labor market but in new
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire the labor force numbers have
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
actually fallen off quite a bit after
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
being relatively flat since the
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
beginning of the initial recovery um
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
that's uh something that's unusual
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's not something we're seeing in a
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
lot of states um and there are a number
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
of idiosyncratic reasons that that could
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
be happening
 
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of people you know working
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
across state lines in terms of people
 
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
working multiple jobs because if i look
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
at the overall number of jobs in new
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire they are approaching their
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
pre-recession or pre-pandemic level so
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
there's some very unique things going on
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
here with the labor market and it's
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
something that's going to be very
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
important to keep an eye on as new
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire's recovery kind of progresses
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
out into the future so
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
with that mr chairman i will stop and
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
pause for questions uh i'd be happy to
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about this or
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
anything that i didn't cover that maybe
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
the committee would love to hear more
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.070 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
representative ames followed by
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for that
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
excellent presentation
 
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.389 align:start position:0%
excellent presentation
um

00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
this is my question you have a chart uh
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's the fifth one
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
showing the the levels of fiscal support
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
um by country and the united states is
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
way above the others
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
and then you have a series of
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
of uh charts that relate to inflation in
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
the united states so my question is how
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
has inflation played out
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
in these other countries that had
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
lower levels of fiscal support
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman that
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
that's a wonderful question
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
um we are seeing in the
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
in the developed countries the developed
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
world which would be pretty much
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
everybody on this chart
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
we have seen increased inflation kind of
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
everywhere and so that's to say that
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
increased federal fiscal stimulus is not
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
the sole cause of inflation in the
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
united states or globally right now
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
but it is a bit more acute in the united
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
states over the last several months
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
especially um and so some of that could
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
be attributable to
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
the fact that we've increased fiscal
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
stimulus more than the average country
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
but again there are so many other things
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind there in terms of supply
 
00:33:00.399 --> 00:33:01.909 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind there in terms of supply
constraints

00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
constraints
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
and especially around the forecast for
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
inflation a lot of that is a supply
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
issue it's not necessarily a demand
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
issue but when you have inflation it's
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
where you have
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
basically there's a there's a mismatch
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
between the amount of supply and demand
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
in the economy that can either come from
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
having way too much demand or it can
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
have come from having not enough supply
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
up until this point it's kind of been a
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
mix we've had a lot more demand than we
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
were able to supply
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
but going forward especially because of
 
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
the sanctions or because of the invasion
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
of ukraine
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
a lot of that will be because of supply
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
is just not able to ramp up as quickly
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
as demand is willing to do and so
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of blame to go around in
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
that but it's certainly been significant
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you before we go to the next
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
question i do have a question on that
 
00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:51.190 align:start position:0%
question i do have a question on that
same

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
figure five
 
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.029 align:start position:0%
figure five
is

00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
how about russia we see china on there
 
00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.950 align:start position:0%
how about russia we see china on there
but

00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
how did russia participate in fiscal
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
support mr chairman russia did provide
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
some token fiscal support but to be
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
honest because of the sanctions that
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
have been leveled on russia since 2014
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
when they first invaded crimea and
 
00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:13.990 align:start position:0%
when they first invaded crimea and
ukraine

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
ukraine
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
russia has been an almost constant
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
state of
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
either economic recession or economic
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
stagnation their economy has really been
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
hurting over the last five or six years
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
and so they really were not in as good
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
of shape as us in their ability to
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
borrow to finance some of these stimulus
 
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.869 align:start position:0%
borrow to finance some of these stimulus
programs

00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing is we've noticed uh and
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to get a lot of
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
transparency into some of the things
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
that they have done around the pandemic
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
they also were not as
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
strict in terms of their lockdowns or
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
mass mandates in russia at least that we
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
can tell
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative aaron
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr white for your
 
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.710 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr white for your
presentation

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at the chart for
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
realization of risks
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
and while um
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
you know under inflation you you
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned supply disruptions and
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
uncertainty but
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't supply chain disruptions and
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
unability unavailability of products be
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
sort of its own
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
category of risks that should be in this
 
00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:28.950 align:start position:0%
category of risks that should be in this
chart

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
chart
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative mr chairman um
 
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.030 align:start position:0%
uh representative mr chairman um
it

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
the the reason that it's included under
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
inflation is that the the net result of
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
inflation very because there's two
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
different parts of the supply disruption
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
there are we've had some
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
supply disruptions up to this point
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
already as a result of the pandemic and
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
those are baked into our baseline
 
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
forecast so we wouldn't necessarily say
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's a risk to the forecast because
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's assumed in there
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
the the risks that we're talking about
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
here are things that weren't assumed in
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
the pre-invasion forecast but now are
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
and that is a lot of those supply
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
disruptions especially around certain
 
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.230 align:start position:0%
disruptions especially around certain
commodities

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
commodities
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
precious metals
 
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of gases and and natural resources
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
that are used in the industrial
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
processes um we're not able to get those
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
out of russia or ukraine or that part of
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
the world and so there's a major
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
additional supply disruption on top of
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
what we're already seeing if that makes
 
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.950 align:start position:0%
what we're already seeing if that makes
sense

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative romney followed by
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
representative wiley
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr white
 
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr white
um

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
let's talk about chips for a minute uh
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
computer chips
 
00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.349 align:start position:0%
computer chips
um

00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's a real problem i mean one
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
of our largest commodities that most
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
people buy are cars
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
and if you go buy any dealership the
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
lots are pretty much vacant right now
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is that intel is
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
looking at building a new large plant in
 
00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.990 align:start position:0%
looking at building a new large plant in
ohio

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
ohio
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
that would help but that's going to be
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
probably a couple years away
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of that so
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
how do economists start looking at a
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
chip shortages i guess the rest of the
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
world is developing at a at a fast pace
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh putting a demand on chips but um
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
what is your what is your outlook in
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
terms of of that production being
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
increased to meet demand representative
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'm glad you brought that up
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's actually one of the most
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
significant supply disruptions that
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
we're facing not just in the united
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
states but globally um and the the
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
incident or the incident the invasion of
 
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.430 align:start position:0%
incident or the incident the invasion of
ukraine

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
ukraine
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
has made that actually worse one of the
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
anecdotes we found out yesterday i was
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
just talking about
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
precious metals and supplies that are
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
used in industrial processes
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
one of the things
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
one of the key inputs to chip production
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
is actually neon gas and the type of
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
neon gas that's used in chip production
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
the united states i believe i just found
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
this out yesterday about 90 percent of
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
the gas the neon gas that we use in our
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
chip production comes from ukraine and
 
00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:00.550 align:start position:0%
chip production comes from ukraine and
russia

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
russia
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
um it's a by-product of their their
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
their steel producing
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
activities um that is gonna be um that's
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
just one of the many different
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
connections that we have with that part
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the world in terms of our industrial
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
production and the supply disruptions
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
that are likely to take place as a
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
result of these new risks that have been
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
realized in the forecast
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
when we look at the forecast in terms of
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
the impacts that these kind of
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
disruptions will have
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
the first place we look is all of the
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
different goods that those ships are
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
used into automobiles being the most
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
important from an inflationary
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
standpoint one of the reasons that the
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
pre-invasion forecast had such a
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
staying power in terms of inflation was
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
very advanced computer goods especially
 
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.750 align:start position:0%
very advanced computer goods especially
automobiles

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
automobiles
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
really increasing in price and those
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
supply constraints not being lifted very
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
quickly you know we're doing all i can
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
we can in the united states you know you
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned the intel planet ohio to try
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
and domesticize some of that production
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
really from an inflationary standpoint
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
but also from a national security
 
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.109 align:start position:0%
but also from a national security
standpoint

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
but that's going to take time to do you
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
don't just you know build a chip plan
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
overnight it's going to take several
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
years and even once that's built out
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to take several years to do
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
that um the the upside to that if there
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
is any is that we are seeing the the car
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
industry the automobile industry doing a
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
really great job of trying to adapt to a
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
world with fewer chips um and so
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
companies are going to do that they're
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
going to adapt they're going to find
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
ways around that but in the meantime as
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
we saw those forecasts there's going to
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
be some really sticky prices and there's
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
going to be some really
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
high uncertainty in terms of consumer
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
spending consumer prices
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
and overall business activity the the
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
flip side of that again the one of the
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
things that makes us feel a little bit
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
better about that from a consumer
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
spending standpoint is that there is a
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of pent up demand pen
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
up cash out there that will help cushion
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
the blow it's not going to make it okay
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
but it's going to make it a lot less
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
painful than it would have been
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
otherwise if we were in a different part
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and mr white
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
i was listening to
 
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
i was listening to
a

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
report about
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
the threat of russia to the u.s and the
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
point was made
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
that the us gdp
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
is 20 times greater than the russian gdp
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
i wonder if you could tell me what the
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
gdp in china or any other country is
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere near
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
the gdp of the u.s representative mr
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
chairman that's correct so the gdp in
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
the u.s is about 22 trillion dollars and
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking in rough numbers here
 
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
um the russian gdp at least before the
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
invasion was somewhere between one and a
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
half and two trillion dollars a year
 
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
just to give you some order magnitude
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
we are the largest gdp in the world and
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
i i could look it up for you china is
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
number two in the world so they're the
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
second largest economy in the world
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
i'd have to look it up but i believe the
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
last i saw they were somewhere around 15
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
 
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.990 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
representative

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman uh
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
i wanted to ask about the supply chain
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
and why you think it's more of a problem
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
for the united states is that only
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative could you
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
yeah on
 
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.510 align:start position:0%
yeah on
you'd

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
you'd
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
the way you'd been talking about uh the
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
supply chain it sounded like it was a
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
greater problem for the united states
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
than for the other countries that
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
we look at
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
and on is that only because of the chip
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
supply problem or what else are we
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
having more problems than anybody else
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
with uh supply representative madam
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
chair i think the
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily significantly worse
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
in the united states than it is in other
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
developed countries like the uk or
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
canada or some of those other countries
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
but i think it does hit us a bit harder
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
mostly because we are a net importer in
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
the united states so we we consume a lot
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
more goods than we produce in the united
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
states and so we are much more reliant
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
on goods that are produced overseas in
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
terms of driving our economy um so if
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
your economy um like china for example
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
that actually exports more than it
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
imports right then you are not going to
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
be as impacted by supply chain
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
disruptions as you would be if you are
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
a country that does the opposite like
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative aaron
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr white i
 
00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.910 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr white i
uh

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
i represent a rural rural communities
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm already hearing from many of the
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
farmers in my district
 
00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.230 align:start position:0%
farmers in my district
that

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
the costs
 
00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.870 align:start position:0%
the costs
for

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
their supplies as they start to think
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
about you know spring planting
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
especially fertilizer that many of the
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
costs of these items are
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
have gone sky high
 
00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.430 align:start position:0%
have gone sky high
and

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
so being that the cost for our farmers
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
has gone up
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about our food production
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
as and and resulting food prices
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
as a result of the increases of the cost
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
to our farmers
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
some farmers may not even continue
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
growing their crops because it just
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay for them
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if you can comment on the
 
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.069 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if you can comment on the
cost

00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:51.109 align:start position:0%
cost
of

00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
inflation for
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
food and and how that will impact our
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
economy and our families who are
 
00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.990 align:start position:0%
economy and our families who are
struggling

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
with the incomes that they have
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
representative uh mr chairman
 
00:44:06.079 --> 00:44:06.870 align:start position:0%
representative uh mr chairman
there

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
the agricultural industry is going to be
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
one of the industries that is most
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
impacted not just by the existing the
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
kind of the pre-invasion outlook that we
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
had for prices but also for
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
the invasion of ukraine um there's kind
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
of two pieces so before you know setting
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
russia and ukraine aside um some of the
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
the areas that we're seeing the biggest
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
price increases going back to
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
semiconductors uh and some of the steels
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
and other raw materials that are used um
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
to make agricultural products um so the
 
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
machinery all the farm machinery is
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
going to go up significantly in price
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
the same similar to what automobiles are
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
doing um but then all the fertilizers a
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
lot of that things they're going to
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
continue to go up for some time
 
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to depend a lot there's going
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of differentiation across
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know different crop types and in
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
livestock versus versus crop
 
00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.589 align:start position:0%
livestock versus versus crop
agriculture

00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
but there there's going to be a lot of
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
differentiation and a lot of pain in
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
terms of price increases in the
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
agricultural sector
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the way that the
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
invasion of ukraine kind of layers over
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
on top of that
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
again we'll probably create additional
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
differentiation in terms of winners and
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
losers within the agricultural industry
 
00:45:17.599 --> 00:45:18.950 align:start position:0%
losers within the agricultural industry
itself

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons first of all the
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
prices for all of those things are going
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
to continue to go up even further so a
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
lot of those inputs are going to go up
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
we talked about you know the neon gas
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
for semiconductors but there's a lot of
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
steel there's a lot of other parts of
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
raw materials that go into the
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
industrial mix that create farm
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
machinery and farm inputs
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
that will continue to go up in price
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
the the offset to that though is
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
especially for wheat in particular
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
agricultural commodity prices are going
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
to go up considerably and they already
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
are going up considering the wheat
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
prices um you know
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
there is so much and i can't remember
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
the exact statistics but a large
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
majority of the world's wheat comes from
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
ukraine and russia and so if ukraine is
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
not producing wheat um it would be the
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
same as like taking saudi arabia out of
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
oil production right taking the ukraine
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
out of wheat production has huge impacts
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the world's markets um
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
and so wheat prices in particular are
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
going to go up so even if you're not in
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
agriculture you're going to experience
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
the pain of higher food prices as a
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
result of wheat prices going up pretty
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
considerably in the next several months
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
again barring a hopefully a quick
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i do
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
so then
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
mr white how do you see
 
00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.349 align:start position:0%
mr white how do you see
that

00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:41.359 --> 00:46:43.030 align:start position:0%
that
inflationary

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
inflationary
 
00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.470 align:start position:0%
inflationary
pressure

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
impacting new hampshire in particular
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair representative or sorry
 
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.349 align:start position:0%
madam chair representative or sorry
representative

00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.710 align:start position:0%
mr chair
the

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is going to be probably a
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
bit more impacted than the rest of the
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
us for a couple of reasons first of all
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
is you know the the footprint of
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
agriculture in new hampshire um but i
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
think the the bigger um
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
impact will be the fact that new
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire hampshire's in the northeast
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
most of new hampshire's trading partners
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
global trading partners are in europe
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
europe is being out
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
is being hit by an outsize impact from
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
the ukraine conflict so as the european
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
economy starts to
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
start a little bit as a result of this
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
conflict a lot of the trading partners
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire firms are going to be
 
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
having trouble as well
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
and so it's not going to be
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
significantly more than the average
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
impact in terms of the united states but
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
00:47:47.839 --> 00:47:49.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
white

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
white
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
your slide on labor force recovery
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
shows that around the middle of last
 
00:47:55.359 --> 00:47:56.230 align:start position:0%
shows that around the middle of last
year

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
the lines crossed and new hampshire is
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
now lagging
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of labor force recovery i'm
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could comment on what
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
factors you think might
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
be leading to that
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh madam
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative mr chair i think um
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
there's a couple things here and i would
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
i would encourage you to ask questions
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
from the the folks who are going to
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
follow me about this because they may
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
have some more informed opinions having
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
watched the new hampshire data much more
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
closely than i have
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
um the the easiest and hopefully
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully most
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully what we would expect to happen
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
here is that hopefully the data is just
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
wrong this is monthly data that comes
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
from the the bls
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's revised and so what we
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
would hope is that that's just a bad
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
reading and it's not really true right
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
but more likely what we are going to see
 
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.670 align:start position:0%
but more likely what we are going to see
is

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
that there are a number of changes or
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
especially around remote work that could
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
be having an impact on this given where
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is located and given that
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of commuters that go
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
across the border to to massachusetts
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
and other states
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
that there are some counting issues
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
where the total number of jobs is still
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
relatively the same
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
but the people are are maybe living on
 
00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:10.470 align:start position:0%
but the people are are maybe living on
another

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
side of the state line than they have
 
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.510 align:start position:0%
side of the state line than they have
previously

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing that could be causing
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
this is especially in lower income
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
households you could have lower income
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
households who are leaving the state but
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
the households who are remaining are
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
working multiple jobs which is why you
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
see a discrepancy between the um
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
the household
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
survey and the
 
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
payroll survey
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
but the the most concerning thing the
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
thing that would worry me most about
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
this is that this is indicative of more
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
people potentially leaving new hampshire
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
altogether so oftentimes when we see
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
data like this what is indicative of and
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
we just don't have enough data to
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
confirm this yet is it's indicative of
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
of people leaving the state for other
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
states um for their workforce and we're
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
seeing this in some other northeastern
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
states we've been seeing it for a while
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
and for example connecticut or new york
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania where i live
 
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.309 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania where i live
um

00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
play people eventually moving the state
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
and leaving the state either because the
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
costs are high or because there's more
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
dynamic labor forces elsewhere or
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
because their population is aging and
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
more people are retiring to to warmer
 
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.230 align:start position:0%
more people are retiring to to warmer
states

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
there's a number of reasons that could
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
cause that but if i were looking at this
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
and exploring in more detail that is the
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
the possibility that would scare me the
 
00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:28.470 align:start position:0%
the possibility that would scare me the
most

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative tunisian
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you um
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
mr white for the presentation um
 
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
one one area that we know has been um
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
becoming increasingly difficult is
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
energy costs
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
barrel of oil being
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
the uh thing that's really set off
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
all sorts of um
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's you know propane or cost of
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
gasoline and so forth anyways that that
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
cost has been going up prior to ukraine
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
and obviously with the russian invasion
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh things are getting much worse very
 
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:06.950 align:start position:0%
uh things are getting much worse very
quickly

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
i heard a report this morning that
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
if the current administration signaled
 
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.270 align:start position:0%
if the current administration signaled
that

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.349 align:start position:0%
that
u.s

00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
u.s
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know a willingness to increase u.s
 
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.870 align:start position:0%
you know a willingness to increase u.s
production

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
production
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
futures markets would quickly
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
cause oil prices to start dropping
 
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:26.559 align:start position:0%
have you done any analysis that and
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
given the pressures
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
on on the administration to start
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
increasing domestic production
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
if that happens have you done any
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
analysis on how that could help
 
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.549 align:start position:0%
analysis on how that could help
inflation

00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
00:51:38.559 --> 00:51:39.589 align:start position:0%
inflation
or

00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
energy prices in general representative
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
mr chairman absolutely we have
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
and there
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because when we look
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
around at
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
the u.s producers are really the swing
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
producers globally now they have been
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
for some time
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
um especially because we have a lot more
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
shale oil than we used to it's a lot
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
easier to turn the taps on and turn the
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
taps off
 
00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.309 align:start position:0%
taps off
quickly

00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
however the capacity that we have in the
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
united states is not to the same degree
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
it doesn't match up very well to all of
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
the untapped capacity that's overseas
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
already there's a there's a tremendous
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
amount of excess capacity already in
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
some of the largest oil producing
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
regions in the country are of the world
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
um saudi arabia for example they could
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
turn on the taps and pump two million
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
more barrels a million barrels of world
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
per day um tomorrow if they wanted to
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
not necessarily tomorrow but in the next
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
couple weeks
 
00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:28.630 align:start position:0%
couple weeks
um

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
iran still has a bunch of oil they
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
haven't brought on the market um
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh the uae has a tremendous amount of
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
world that the capacity they could turn
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
back on that are much more significant
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
than what we would be able to turn on in
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
the united states um and so
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
any of if any of those countries decided
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
or opec in general decided to
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
turn the taps back on to do that
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
they could definitely equilibrate
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
equilibrate prices much more quickly
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
than what we're seeing
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
but i think the reason that most
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
producers and you could argue that u.s
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
producers aren't doing this either is
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
they're waiting to see kind of how long
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
this disruption is going to last is
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
russian production going to be taken off
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
for a significant period of time
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
or is it just causing displacement
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
within the market we know that russia
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
usually sells i think about 5
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
million barrels of oil per day
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
about half of that goes to europe
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
and another significant chunk of it goes
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
to china
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
china has showed that they're going to
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
continue to buy they're trying to stay
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
out of it it seems but they're they're
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
continuing to buy russian oil with no
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
problem and they're actually buying at a
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
huge discount right now because very few
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
other people will buy russian oil so
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
russia is going to continue to sell
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
their oil and
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of europe is still buying their
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
energy from russia and so the the point
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
is if we turned on capacity in the u.s
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
it probably wouldn't have much of an
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
impact in terms of overall prices it
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
sending some some signals in terms of
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
sentiment but it wouldn't have
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily a huge impact on the
 
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
the interplay between supply and demand
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.349 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:54:07.359 --> 00:54:08.630 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.510 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay so in a in a longer shorter term
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
um it may not
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
help immediately but longer term if i if
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
i think back to say a year and a half
 
00:54:20.559 --> 00:54:21.349 align:start position:0%
i think back to say a year and a half
ago

00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
when the u.s was the largest uh
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
exporter or largest producer
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
prices were staying down so
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
i guess you know in a longer term
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
scenario it seems like it would help
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
longer term keep prices down because now
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
these other exporters have to compete
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
with u.s prices representative mr
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
chairman i think longer term you know
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
the more energy dependent independent
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
the united states is the better off
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
things are for the united states um but
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other really big
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
producers out there in terms of the
 
00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
overall supply and demand i don't know
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
that it would have too much of an impact
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
on prices i think a lot of what we're
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
seeing in prices right now is a result
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
of just uncertainty over the
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
invasion of ukraine
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
but to your point um the more
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
supply that the u.s can bring to bear on
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
the global economy the more control
 
00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
and more certainty that we will have
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
mr white you've done a great job on your
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
presentation and answering questions i
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
have one more question
 
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
a new event happened last night
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
in that the russians took over the nuke
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
the largest nuclear facility
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
in europe
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
which is located in ukraine
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
if they shut that down have you done an
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
analysis of what that will do
 
00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.789 align:start position:0%
analysis of what that will do
to

00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
everything that you talked about
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
well mr chairman thank you for saving
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
there's um
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
we have not done a an active um
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
uh research on it but what we know just
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
anecdotally again we're still finding
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
out a lot of the news that came out last
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
night from what we understand is there
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
were only two of the reactors that were
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
still functioning at the at the power
 
00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:16.470 align:start position:0%
still functioning at the at the power
plant

00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
plant
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
um so if they just shut it down and it's
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
no longer able to produce power
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
we don't see that as a huge um economic
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
cost outside of ukraine itself um they
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
that power plant i don't believe was
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
exporting power to any other countries
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
around europe
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
but to your point
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
the potential escalation of this
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
conflict beyond
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
you know what it is today which is
 
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
horrific enough as it is but the
 
00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.630 align:start position:0%
horrific enough as it is but the
potential

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
escalation of that beyond what it is
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
creates some economic um scenarios that
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
are much darker than the ones that i
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
showed you here today and so um it's a
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's a very scary time
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
period but it's a very scary time
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
economically and the the odds of
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
something going wrong that pushes us
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
into a recession or into something
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
that's much
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
scarier than a recession are much higher
 
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:08.950 align:start position:0%
scarier than a recession are much higher
today

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
either

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.309 align:start position:0%
either
committee

saying thank you again
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
mr white
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
for agreeing to do this for us thank you
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
so much for having me thank you thank
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.079 --> 00:57:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
we're right on time because it's one
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
minute to 10

i think so yes i'm going to make sure
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
that i can advance these slides smoothly
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
okay i'll wait until you check that and
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
you may have to bear with me if i have
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
to scroll through them but i'm happy to

thank you all for the opportunity to
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
speak uh with you this morning um i have
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
quite a few slides so i'm going to go
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
through them relatively quickly but if
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
you do have a at the chairman's
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
discretion too if you do have a quick
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
technical question about a slide i'm
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
happy to take it as we go along um
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
really i'm hoping that this will also be
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
a reference for you as you go forward
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
you can consult this slide deck
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
again and i'm happy to of course take
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
questions afterwards and i'll stick
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
around through the lunch hour as well if
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
anyone has any questions um after
 
01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
after the subsequent presentation
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
so um what i'll do here is i'll start
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
with uh the slide that you'll also see
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
at the end of the presentation this is a
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
quick summary of the takeaways that um
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
that the this presentation will discuss
 
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
and you'll see some of the
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
some of the data that tell this story um
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
in in overview the economy has uh has
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
recovered from sort of the early points
 
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
of the earliest points of the coven 19
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
crisis but the recovery has not been
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
complete we're not back to the trend
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
line that we would have expected it
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
hadn't happened yet i mean it has been
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
uneven it hasn't been
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
it hasn't reached everyone evenly in the
 
01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.630 align:start position:0%
it hasn't reached everyone evenly in the
state

01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
federal assistance has provided
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
significant economic stimulus that's a
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
key part of the reason why we saw the
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
level of growth that we did in the
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
second half of 2020 and throughout 2021
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
but there are workforce constraints on
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire economy and those
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
workforce constraints are driven in part
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
by some of the some of the continuing
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
health effects of the pandemic and
 
01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.549 align:start position:0%
health effects of the pandemic and
the

01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
and the limitations that we see in terms
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
of access to child care as well as some
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
of the long-term demographic trends that
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
the state would have been facing anyway
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
even if there hadn't been a pandemic
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
there was already some discussion of
 
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
inflation i'll mention it here that
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
inflation is a risk for the economy
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
going forward including in new hampshire
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
and it's in part due to the rapid
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
changes that we've seen in spending on
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
goods and services it's been hard for
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
private sector markets to adjust and
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
what happens on that front going forward
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
has implications for the hampton new
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire economy and the economy as a
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
whole as well as inflation uh
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
the household budgets in new hampshire
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
that we've household incomes in new
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire have been outpaced by
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
inflation through 2021 at least based on
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
preliminary data and that also has
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
implications for people's spending power
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
and there are significant opportunities
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
for the state to help build an equitable
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
inclusive recovery going forward
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
particularly with the available federal
 
01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.950 align:start position:0%
particularly with the available federal
resources

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
now i've broken this presentation into
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
three parts parts one and three are much
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
shorter than part two but the first part
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
is just looking at sort of general
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
economic conditions and a quick overview
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
of what we see in the new hampshire
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
economy right now
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
so the graph that you see on slide four
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
has two lines on it the one that is
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
green or in the squares
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
that is gross state product so it's our
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
own state level version of gdp gross
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
national gross domestic product and you
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
can see that it is not back up to trend
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
line it's not back to where we would
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
have expected it to be
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
if there hadn't been a pandemic that you
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
can see the the downward spike if you
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
will in the second quarter of 2020 but
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's a about back up to where it was
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
prior to that right at the end of 2019
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
and uh and that you know that suggests
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
that a significant portion of the
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
economy at least in terms of this gross
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
state product measure has recovered but
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
if you look at the other line which is
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
employment in the state average
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
quarterly employment in this state we
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
haven't seen that come back to those
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic levels yet and again both
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
are below the trend line that we would
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
have expected again if there hadn't been
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
a pandemic
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'll note that these numbers do get
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
revised so if you were to look at gross
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
state product in six months or a year it
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
might look a little bit different
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
but these are the best data that we have
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
at this time for that measure
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
we can break that measure down by
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
industry so what you see on page five is
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of gross state product by
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
the by industry and the contributions of
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
each industry to grow state product
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
specifically how they've changed in the
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
second third quarters of 2021 relative
 
01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
to those two middle quarters in 2019 so
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
what industries have grown since then in
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
their gross state product contribution
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
and which have fallen behind you can see
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
all the way over on the left real estate
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
rental and leasing retail trade
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
which includes online services as well
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
management of companies is a relatively
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
small industry but has seen growth
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
administrative support services
 
01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
wholesale trade information
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
transportation warehousing utilities
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
construction and accommodation and food
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
services even on the positive side of
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
the ledger on the other side you can see
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
arts and entertainment and recreation is
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
still quite a bit lower again in the
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
middle two quarters of 2021 relative to
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
those middle two quarters of 2019
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
so that's contributions to gross state
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
product but what about
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
the shifts in employment how has
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
employment changed and you can see that
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
on slide six um this is measuring two
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
different items one is the change in
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
employment by industry this isn't every
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
industry but this is most of them
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
in employment comparing the preliminary
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
estimates that we have for december 2021
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
to what we saw as measures the same
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
measure of employment in december 2019
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
that's that solid bar or the green one
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at the color version
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
and in the cross hatch bar or the blue
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
one what's the change since 2020 and if
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
we look at the change at on the left
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
side of the graph we can see that
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
manufacturing for example is still well
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
below where it was in 20 in december
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
2019 it's a little bit higher than it
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
was in december of 2020 so suggest some
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
recovery but there's still a ways to go
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
education services um healthcare and
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
social assistance we see a similar story
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
retail trade is down by both measures
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
and then accommodation food services
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
we've seen quite a bit of recovery from
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
december of 2020 but it's still below
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
where it was in december of 2019.
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
if you look all the way over on the
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
right side we can see sort of double
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
positives if you will in professional
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
scientific and technical services and
 
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
then transportation warehousing and
 
01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:49.750 align:start position:0%
then transportation warehousing and
utilities

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
so that's a picture of where the job
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
recovery is in terms of industry
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
but what about geography
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
if you take a look at slide seven this
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
is total jobs broken up by county and
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
this is comparing the average employment
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
based in the county in the first three
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
quarters of 19 of 2019 to the first
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
three quarters of 2021.
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
and one thing that's interesting here is
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
there's not necessarily a clear
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
sort of rural urban pattern there's not
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily a clear pattern in terms of
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
region of the state there may be some
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
patterns by industry but you know for
 
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.230 align:start position:0%
patterns by industry but you know for
example

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
if you look at carroll county and coast
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
county those saw the biggest percentage
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
declines which is the cross thatch bar
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
you those are the biggest percentage
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
declines in the number of jobs uh in
 
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
this three quarters of 2021 relative to
 
01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.190 align:start position:0%
this three quarters of 2021 relative to
2019.

01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
2019.
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
of course the the number is relatively
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
small compared to for example
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
hillsborough and rockingham counties
 
01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.430 align:start position:0%
hillsborough and rockingham counties
but

01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
it's still a larger percentage decline
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
in those areas so that might be you know
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
recreation accommodation and food
 
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
services those we could see that those
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
industries may be more important in
 
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
those counties
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of employment however if you
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
look at some other rural counties in the
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
state or more rural counties in the
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
state sullivan cheshire county for
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
example we see some of the smallest
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
percentage declines
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
and then hillsborough belknap grafton or
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
sort of in the middle if you will so
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
there's not a clear pattern on that
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
front but what is clear is that there's
 
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.870 align:start position:0%
front but what is clear is that there's
still

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
at least based on these data there's
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
still job recovery to be had in every
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
county in the state
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
so i'll move on to the second part of
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
the presentation and what i've tried to
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
do would you take your question yes
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative yeah thank you
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
good seeing you again nice to see you as
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
well um this is a silly question i and
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
greg on on five when we say mining
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
quarrying oil gas obviously we have no
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
oil or gas extraction so mining must be
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
uh granite
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh granite mining would fall under this
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
yes um and this is this is a very small
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
industry right relative to some of the
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
other industries that you see on this
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
graph so this this is a complete picture
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
i didn't i included every industry on
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
here if i recall correctly that one a
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
small percentage change is not a big
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
number of jobs and not as big a gross
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
state product contribution as as some of
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
these other ones again it's a percentage
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
change but pretty much grant i can't
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
think of anything else we quarry i i
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
can't think of anything else either but
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge around the table would help
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
yeah okay gravel i guess yeah there we
 
01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:17.269 align:start position:0%
yeah okay gravel i guess yeah there we
go

01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you phil
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
i'm pete on slide number four can you
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
tell me how the
 
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
average quarterly in
 
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
employment would compare to a
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic graph of the same
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
of the projection anyways yeah that's a
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
great question and i think we'll we'll
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
get to some of that in part two of the
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
presentation um but i think that what we
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
see here is something that may be
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
somewhat lower than we would have seen
 
01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.590 align:start position:0%
somewhat lower than we would have seen
before

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
but the num the the pre-pandemic
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
employment was on an upward trajectory
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
after having been um at least the size
 
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
of the labor force having been
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
relatively stagnant for some time so
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
the i think that's a key question the
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
question is here whether the pandemic
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
has accelerated trends that would have
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
already been happening in which case it
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
would have been a little bit higher or
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
if the pandemic has led to more
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
fundamental shifts in the economy that
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
have resulted in lower employment
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
and i think it's probably the former i
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
think that we may have seen employment
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
be a little bit higher than it is now
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
but it's not as though we would have
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
seen a massive upward trajectory that is
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
still a lot lower so we'll talk about
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more in in subsequent
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
slides but i hope that i hope that makes
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
sense and addresses your question
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead and continue okay thank you
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
so um in part two of the presentation
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to do is is hold myself
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
accountable a little bit because at the
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
end of uh january 2021 i had the opera
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
in january 2021 i had the opportunity to
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
present to the house and senate ways and
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
means committees and at the end of that
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
presentation i asked a series of
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
that the answers of those would help
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
inform what the economy looks like in
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
the future um and in posing those
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
questions to you um i thought that it
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
was fair to me for me to go back and try
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
to answer those questions as best as i
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
could a year later with the available
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
information that we have
 
01:11:12.719 --> 01:11:13.590 align:start position:0%
information that we have
so

01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
you'll see on slide nine these are the
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
questions that i posed at the end of
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
that 2021 presentation
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
exactly as i uh posed them to you
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
with a different title on the slide and
 
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go through each of them not
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
exactly in this order but i'm going to
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
go through each of them and try my best
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
to answer them
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
in part two
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
so first
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
will workers be able to rejoin the
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
workforce efficiently and this is key
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
question then obviously a key question
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
now and gets a little bit to what some
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
of senator hennessey had just asked
 
01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:44.470 align:start position:0%
of senator hennessey had just asked
about

01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
so you can see on slide 11 this is a
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
graph of the not seasonally adjusted
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
size of the workforce in new hampshire
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
and note that it does start at 500 000
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
so the graph axis doesn't start at zero
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
um and and you can see the uh total
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
number of people who are employed on a
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
monthly basis based on these estimates
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
in the solid bar and then the cross that
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
shows the number of people who are
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
officially recognized as unemployed
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
they're they're actively seeking work
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
but they don't have a job
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
and you can see that we are still below
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
our pre-pandemic peak our pre-pandemic
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
peak again not seasonally adjusted was
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
july of 2019
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
and i believe i'm remembering correctly
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
the january 2022 data are about 28 000
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
fewer people in the workforce than that
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
july figure of course if this were
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
comparing july to july i might be a
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more concerned by that drop
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
than i am but that's still noteworthy
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
that we are not back in terms of the
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
size of the labor force in new hampshire
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
to those pre-pandemic levels
 
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:44.870 align:start position:0%
to those pre-pandemic levels
now

01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
that is likely part of a long-term
 
01:12:47.199 --> 01:12:48.550 align:start position:0%
that is likely part of a long-term
decline

01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
decline
 
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
but that long-term decline was probably
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
accelerated by the pandemic so if you
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
look on slide 12 you can see that there
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
are two lines one is the line that has
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
the two um sidebar lines on either side
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
of it that is the actual size of the
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
labor force and uh that
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
that actual size of labor force in terms
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the number of people participating in
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's labor force um you can
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
see that over the last and this is uh
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
this graph shows 2000 to 2021 on a
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
12-month rolling average
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at just before the great
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
recession so 2006 2007 the labor force
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
size stayed relatively consistent over
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
roughly a 10-year period following that
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
again on a 12-month rolling average
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
basis and it wasn't until we really
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
started to see the economy heat up and
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate in new hampshire
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
had fallen below 3 percent for some time
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
that we saw the size of the labor force
 
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
actually start to increase and you can
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
see that in the data for 2017
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
2019 on this graph and then the pandemic
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
hits and you see that line turn back
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
down and appear to be a little bit lower
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
now than where it was before for that
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
long period of time
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
the solid line on the graph shows the
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
labor force participation rate so this
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
is measuring
 
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.430 align:start position:0%
is measuring
basically

01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
relative to population what has happened
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
to the size of the labor force and the
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
labor force participation rate has been
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
in a long-term decline and that
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
long-term decline appeared to maybe
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
stall when we were in that um a hotter
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
job market leading up to the pandemic
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
but the pandemic has turned it down and
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
you can see again that 12 month rolling
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
average suggests that we're below maybe
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
where the trend line would have
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
been so why is the labor force smaller
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
than it was before what insights can we
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
gain from available data as to why the
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
labor force may be smaller in new
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire you can see on slide 13 that
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
this is the labor force participation
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
rate comparing 2019 to 2021 so what's
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
the change over those two
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
across those two years
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
and looking at the labor force
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
participation rate by age group and you
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
can see that for most every age group
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
the labor force participation rate is
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
lower i'll note if you look at different
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
time periods these data do fluctuate
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
especially in the ends right for the
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
groups that are not as large a part of
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
the labor force so that 75 and over age
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
group the 16 to 19 those vary a little
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
bit more depending on the time period
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
but i want to draw your attention to two
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh two specific portions of the
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
population one is the younger workers
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
particularly those workers aged 20 to 34
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
or specifically age age 25 to 34 we see
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
that 3.1 percent drop and then somewhat
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
older workers those aged 55 to 74 where
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
we see that 3.5 drop
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about that second group
 
01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.070 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about that second group
first

01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
if we look at data from the current
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
population survey which asks people in
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
part about their employment status one
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
of the questions that one of the one of
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
the answers that you can get to those
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
questions in that survey
 
01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.070 align:start position:0%
questions in that survey
is

01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
that someone says they do not want a job
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
right they're not looking for work
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
because they do not want a job right now
 
01:15:58.630 --> 01:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
what you see on slide 14 is the number
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
of people
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
who are um age 16 to 24 age 25 to 54 or
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
age 55 years and older who are
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
indicating that they do not want a job
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
and that's why they're not in the labor
 
01:16:10.159 --> 01:16:11.030 align:start position:0%
and that's why they're not in the labor
force

01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
force
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
and the across the three years 2019 2020
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
and 2021 that you can see represented by
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
these bars the 16 to 24 age group and
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
the 25 to 34 age group is pretty
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
consistent but we can see the 55 years
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
and older age group across these three
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
years again as we enter the pandemic and
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
we're solidly inside the pandemic in
 
01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.390 align:start position:0%
we're solidly inside the pandemic in
2021

01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
we can see that that number has
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
increased right so that's probably where
 
01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
we're losing a significant portion of
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
the labor force again people entering
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
traditional retirement age this is not
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily a surprise but there may
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
also be some health factors associated
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
with people saying i'm potentially more
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
at risk than other age groups i'm going
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
to take myself out of the labor force
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
over the course of the pandemic so we
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
don't know how much of this is temporary
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
and how much is permanent for example
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
if you look on slide 15
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
you can see the age distribution the
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
estimated age distribution based on 2019
 
01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.030 align:start position:0%
estimated age distribution based on 2019
data

01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
for the age demographics in the state
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
where is the population relative to
 
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
their ages and you can see there are two
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
peaks there's roughly the 20 to 29 age
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
group is one peak and then roughly 50 to
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
64. and remember this is 2019 estimates
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't have the 2020
 
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
census data at this granular level yet
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
but uh everyone's probably about three
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
years older right
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
now and you can see here that if we look
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
at we do have this peak that is in that
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
50 to 64 age group if you compare these
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
2019 data to 2010 which i do on the next
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
two slides you can see that relative to
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
2010 about 109 000 more people are age
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
55 and older and about 74 000 more
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
people are age 65 and older so again
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
there are some long-term demographics at
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
play here that you don't necessarily see
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
to this level at the national economy
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
that likely answer a significant part of
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
this question around what has happened
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
to the labor force and what has been
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
happening to the labor force in new
 
01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.990 align:start position:0%
happening to the labor force in new
hampshire

01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
now let's talk a little bit about the
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
younger end of the spectrum what may be
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
happening particularly with those 25 to
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
34 age group
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've seen as a
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
result of the pandemic is the u.s census
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
bureau has started conducting what's
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
called the household pulse survey
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
fortunately we didn't have these data
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic but it is a
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
more of a week on week or a short number
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
of weeks in terms of a turnaround for
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
when are we getting data that asks a
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
bunch of questions of survey respondents
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
including about their employment status
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
and if they aren't working what are
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
their reasons for not working so they
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
have a series of options to pick from
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
about half the people that responded to
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
the survey in new hampshire and said
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
they weren't working and we're looking
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
at the time period here of
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
i've aggregated july to the most recent
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
data in february to sort of give us a
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more of a solid picture as
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to a lot of variability from
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
week to week
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
we about half the people in new
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire said i'm not working because
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm retired right so half the people who
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
said they weren't working gave that
 
01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:08.709 align:start position:0%
said they weren't working gave that
reason

01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:19:08.719 --> 01:19:09.430 align:start position:0%
reason
so

01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
this graph doesn't show those folks who
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
said i'm not working because i'm retired
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
if you and doesn't show the folks who
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
gave an uncategorized reason but if you
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
look at the categorized reasons
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
the top reason was because someone said
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
they were sick or they had a disability
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
and they were not working as a as a
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
result the next most common reason was
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
someone said i or that adults identified
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
was that they were caring for children
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
not in school or in daycare
 
01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:38.229 align:start position:0%
not in school or in daycare
so

01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who aren't working are
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
saying you know you know five or six
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
percent of the people who aren't working
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
and that 506 percent includes the pool
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
of folks who are retired
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
said they were not working because they
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
were caring for children who weren't who
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have care otherwise right and
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
this is this is saying people who are
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
not working period not people who are
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
for example scaling back their hours or
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
splitting their time differently
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
um the third reason is uh and again we
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
don't have a pre-pandemic baseline but
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
the third reason the third most common
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
reason was i did not want to be employed
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
the fourth was there was caring for
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
someone who was sick with covet 19 or
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
they had symptoms themselves
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
that they were laid off or furloughed
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic was the next reason
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
that they were concerned about getting
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
or spreading the coronavirus or that
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
they were caring for an older adult so
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
that rounds out sort of the top reasons
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
that we can see here again based on
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
these data
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
um yes i see you uh representative braun
 
01:20:35.679 --> 01:20:36.870 align:start position:0%
um yes i see you uh representative braun
abramdi

01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
abramdi
 
01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:37.669 align:start position:0%
abramdi
so

01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
where would uh
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
parents who decide that one of the
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
parents that's going to stay home and
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh raise the kids
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
right so um and this is how where we're
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
at the mercy of how an uh an individual
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
decides based on the categories that
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
available to respond to the question so
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
um it could be that it would probably be
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
where the the caring for children
 
01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
category but it could be that someone
 
01:21:00.159 --> 01:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
category but it could be that someone
said

01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
well it's not that i'm caring for
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
children because they're not in school
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
or daycare so i'm just going to say for
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
example i don't want to be employed at
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
this time right because i'm caring for
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
children but i'm not not being employed
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
because they were because they would
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise be in daycare or in school and
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
that's not available right so we are
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
stuck with some of the nuances
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately of how people may have
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
responded to this individually but i
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
hope that addresses your question
 
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.149 align:start position:0%
hope that addresses your question
representative

01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
so let's move on to the next question um
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
will employment income losses and there
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
were there was quite a bit of employment
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
income loss especially in 2020
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
lead to a more sort of regular looking
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
recession if you will
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
or the will the recovery happen more
 
01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.070 align:start position:0%
or the will the recovery happen more
quickly

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
and we've seen that especially um
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
especially given some of the information
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
that we even saw in the last
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
presentation that those employment
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
income losses were
 
01:21:58.950 --> 01:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
don't appear to have be something that
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
is slowing down the economy right now
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
they could still be a significant
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
component of it particularly for lower
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
income workers but
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is that you know the
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
employment growth constraints are
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
less associated with income losses in
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
2020 or ongoing income losses and appear
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
to be more associated with um
 
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
with some of these other factors so the
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
graph on page 20 shows two different
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
measures of employment
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
one is a monthly survey a more a rapidly
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
produced monthly survey and one is a
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
count based on the unemployment
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
compensation system
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
counts and we can see that there's you
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
know there's been a slowing in
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
employment growth over this time period
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
that that is that is something that was
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
workforce constraints which we'll talk
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
about a little we've already talked
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
about some we'll talk about a little bit
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
more is definitely a risk to the economy
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
going forward um on slide 21 i wanted to
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
address and you already had a great
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
discussion about inflation so i'm not
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
going to talk about it very much here
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
but i did want to address inflation a
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
little bit in terms of the
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
risk to the economy going forward in new
 
01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:05.590 align:start position:0%
risk to the economy going forward in new
hampshire

01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that gives me a little
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
bit more confidence that what we're
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
seeing is temporary is just how much of
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
a shift there has been in expenditures
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
like household expenditures so this is a
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
measure of personal consumption
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
expenditures in the united states these
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
are these aren't new hampshire data on
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
slide 21
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
you can see that overall personal
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
consumption expenditures may be back to
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
where they were on trend line relative
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
to these are all relative to the last
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2019
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
but we've seen a really significant
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
shift in what people are spending money
 
01:23:35.199 --> 01:23:36.229 align:start position:0%
shift in what people are spending money
on

01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
and that's hard for markets to keep up
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
with right when we're talking about
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
services being quite a bit lower but
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
goods particularly durable goods being
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
20 percent higher at the end of last
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
year and even close to 30 percent in the
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
middle of last year that's a really
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
significant shift that is difficult as
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
is going to feed into these supply chain
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
bottlenecks and feed into the inflation
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
that we've seen
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
this also has long-term implications not
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
just for inflation what does the economy
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
look like after the pandemic is this
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
shift to goods a little bit more
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
permanent or do we see services catch
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
back up
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
as as hopefully we see fewer covet 19
 
01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.270 align:start position:0%
as as hopefully we see fewer covet 19
variants

01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
variants
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
causing disruptions to
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
what the econ relative to what the
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
economy looked like prior to the
 
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.750 align:start position:0%
economy looked like prior to the
pandemic

01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
now we don't unfortunately have data at
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
that level at detail for new hampshire
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
itself um but you can see on slide 22
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
comparing 2019 to 2020 and those same
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
personal consumption expenditures you
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
can see that services were quite a bit
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
lower in 2020 than they were in 2019 on
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
a per capita basis
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
expenditures on a per capita basis
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
whereas for goods they went up so
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll get more data and
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
understand the picture more in new
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire when we get to when we get
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
those 2021 data but we don't have them
 
01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.350 align:start position:0%
those 2021 data but we don't have them
yet

01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
now one cost i want to mention in
 
01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
now one cost i want to mention in
particular

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
that is a significant economic headwind
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is housing and the
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
housing supply and you'll hear more
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
about housing from people who know more
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
about it than i do in the afternoon
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
but the housing supply is very
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
constrained in the state and has become
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
dramatically more constrained than even
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
its pre-pandemic constrained status
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
over the course of over the course of
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
the last few years
 
01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
what you can see on slide 23 is the in
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
the solid lines with triangles and
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
squares respectively the median home
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
sale prices or for single family homes
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
and for condos and both have gone up
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
quite dramatically i mean for the this
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
is a 12-month rolling average but
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
comparing 2018 to
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
the latest data from january 2022 we can
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
see that on a month rolling average the
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
median home sale price has gone up from
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
maybe about 280 thousand dollars to
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
nearly 400 thousand dollars whereas
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
previously we only saw 400 thousand
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
dollar median home sale prices in for
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
example rockingham county now that's the
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
statewide figure
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the two dashed lines
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
or the dashed and dotted lines those are
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
measures of inventory inventory was
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
already constrained at the beginning at
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
the at the left side of this graph if
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
you will
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
now we're seeing a much more constrained
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
housing inventory and that translates
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
into costs for people in terms of their
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
ability to purchase a home and the you
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
know what they might have for a monthly
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
mortgage payment or as you can see on
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
slide 24 how it interacts with the
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
rental market
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
this is a much longer time horizon on
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
this graph we don't have as as
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
frequented data on the rental side but
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh from 2011 to 2021 you can see on the
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
bars the vacancy rate has gone down
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
quite a bit
 
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
and uh and the median meant uh monthly
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
rent uh and utility costs for a two
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
bedroom apartment has gone up from a
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
little over a thousand dollars a month
 
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
to just under fifteen hundred dollars a
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
month statewide and that's a quite
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
significant increase in costs um
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
particularly given that renters tend to
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
be lower incomes and have a
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
considerably lower median household
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
income based on the available data that
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
and one more constraint that i want to
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
point to when it comes to what does if
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
if the what are the headwinds that the
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
economy faces in new hampshire that
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
might lead to um or that might increase
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
the risk of um either a recession or a
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
slowdown um one uh is the because the
 
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
continued impacts of the virus and also
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
the limited child care access that we
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
had before the pandemic
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's likely leading quite a few people
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
to at least curtail their hours in terms
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
of their participation in the workforce
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
and what you see in this pie chart on
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
slide 25 is the percentage again these
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
are the census bureau household pulse
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
survey data this is the percentage of
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
adults with children under five who said
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
in their child care plans um in the last
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
four weeks and looking at september to
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
january september of last year to
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
january of this year um
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know 30 percent or i should say one
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
in three or more than one in three
 
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
adults identifying that is quite
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
significant in terms of the amount of
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
impact it can have on people's ability
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
to engage in the labor force
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
so the next question um that i want to
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
address is the question posed in january
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
2021 will there be sufficient training
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
or education opportunities to prepare
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
people to enter a post-pandemic economy
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
well i'm going to contend a little bit
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
that we aren't quite yet in a
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
post-pandemic economy but there is a
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
significant opportunity
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
i would say to
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
at least in terms of formal
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
upskilling of the workforce in new
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire if there is if we get to a
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
point where
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's clear that the post-pandemic
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
economy would be better addressed by by
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
a labor force that has more formal
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
education or more higher formal
 
01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.270 align:start position:0%
education or more higher formal
education

01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
so we can see that the
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
this pie chart on slide 27 shows the
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
educational attainment in new hampshire
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
in 2019 and shows the median annual
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
incomes and we can see that those annual
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
incomes do go up as the level of formal
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
educational attainment does increase um
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
obviously you know this this isn't
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily the path for everyone but we
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
can see that roughly a little bit more
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
than a quarter of the population age 25
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
years and older
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
had a high school degree or equivalent
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
and then of roughly one in five had some
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
college but no degree
 
01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
and uh that that group in particular
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
means that you might have for example
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
student debt associated with college but
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
you don't have the degree to sort of
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
unlock those higher level of wages so
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
this is just to give you a picture of
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
where we were before the pandemic i am
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
focusing a little bit on adults here
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
this age uh population 25 years and
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
older because if you look at the next
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
slide you can see that the um the number
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
of children who are likely going to be
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
entering the workforce in the future has
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
been declining right this is the this
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
graph on slide 28 shows the student
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment in new hampshire's public
 
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
schools and it peaked around
 
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
2002 2003
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
and has been dropping since then you can
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
see that in the most recent years we've
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
seen the impacts of the pandemic
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
particularly on the 2020-2021 school
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
year although there has been a little
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
bit of a rebound since then but
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
this suggests that there are going to be
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
fewer people entering the workforce from
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire schools than we've seen in
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
the past and this is again a long-term
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
demographic trend
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
and even relative to other states and if
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
you look on slide 29 even relative to
 
01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
this is an important consideration when
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
we think about economic growth going
 
01:30:20.159 --> 01:30:22.390 align:start position:0%
we think about economic growth going
forward

01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
this graph on slide 29 shows the
 
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
percentage change in the number of
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
children the number of people under age
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
18 in each state if you compare the 2010
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
to the 2020 census counts and new
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire saw the largest percentage
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
decline of any state
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
in the number of children who lived in
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
so that's significant when it comes to
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
what do we have to think about in new
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire in particular when it comes to
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
the economy when it comes to the the
 
01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.189 align:start position:0%
the economy when it comes to the the
workforce

01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
et cetera
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
now on slide 30 we begin the next
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
question which is will wages grow
 
01:30:59.350 --> 01:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
meaningfully and this is an important
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
question because in the last economic
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
recovery real wages didn't grow for many
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
workers particularly workers with median
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
or lower incomes consistently throughout
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
that recovery what you can see on slide
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
31 is a graph that many of you have seen
 
01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:14.950 align:start position:0%
31 is a graph that many of you have seen
before

01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
which shows the wages the
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
inflation-adjusted wages comparing the
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
2004 to 2006 period so before the
 
01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.750 align:start position:0%
2004 to 2006 period so before the
recession

01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
recession
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
to 2017 to 2019
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
and you can see that those lower
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
percentile wage groups didn't really see
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
significant wage growth relative to
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
inflation and indeed if you were to take
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
a snapshot of a few years before saw
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
wages that were had not kept up with
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
inflation um the median wage had kept up
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
with inflation for a good portion of
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
that time but
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
was still behind for some of the great
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
recession and ended the recovery from
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
the great recession at about where it
 
01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
was before and you can see that higher
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
wages did grow relative to inflation
 
01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:55.750 align:start position:0%
wages did grow relative to inflation
so

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have these data unfortunately
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
yet for the sort of post pandemic
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
or the post the beginning of the
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic but
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
we do have some data and slide 32 shows
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
some of this higher frequency data that
 
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
does um give us a picture as to
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
what the impacts were what the
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
distributional impacts were on
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
employment based on what jobs the jobs
 
01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:18.310 align:start position:0%
employment based on what jobs the jobs
paid

01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
paid
 
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
and this shows that if you look
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
especially in that first year of the
 
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic there was a very significant
 
01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:24.709 align:start position:0%
pandemic there was a very significant
drop

01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
drop
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
in um in employment across the board but
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
it was particularly severe for lower
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
wage work and that lower wage work took
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
a longer time to recover
 
01:32:34.239 --> 01:32:34.950 align:start position:0%
a longer time to recover
now

01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
last year senator gaida had asked about
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
what portion of the population what
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
portion of jobs are actually in that
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
low-wage group in new hampshire
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
these data are based on
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
national level quartiles so that low
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
wage group is the bottom 25 percent the
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
high wage group is the top 25 percent in
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
the middle wage group is the middle 50
 
01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:54.709 align:start position:0%
the middle wage group is the middle 50
percent

01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a little bit of a
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
higher wage state generally than a lot
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
of other states around the country so
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
that low wage group may be a little bit
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
less than that 25 percent
 
01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:04.950 align:start position:0%
less than that 25 percent
however

01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
if you look at household incomes prior
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic
 
01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
then about one in five households in new
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire had less than 35 000 per year
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
in income again that's households not
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
jobs so it's not exactly the same unit
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
of measurement but suggests that it's
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
pretty close in new hampshire to you
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
know maybe that bottom quartile
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey also asked a question
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
last year around
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
what may be happening uh within the
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
economy when there were so many low-wage
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
positions that she was seeing unfilled
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
in the economy um and uh and senator i
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
think what you may have been seeing as
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
we can see later in this graph is that
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
we see middle wage and high-wage job
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
growth that you know at least based on
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
these data may be outpacing what we saw
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
what what we see as the overall job
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
growth in new hampshire and that is the
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
so the hopeful interpretation of that is
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
that more people who were previously in
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
low-wage work have been able to migrate
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
into what you might categorize as middle
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
wage work or even higher wage work um in
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
the towards the end of this graph but
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
again the data here end in august so
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
there's still some unanswered questions
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
but um but that may be part of what
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
we're seeing
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
now one uh
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
one thing that i want to show to remind
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh to remind all of us about is the what
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
employment looked like before the
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic and how it was broken up by
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
industry you can see that on slide 33
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
this is again a similar graph to what i
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
showed you um uh back at the back
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
at uh in january 2021 um healthcare and
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
social assistance has had recently
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
passed retail trade as the largest
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
employer in the state and then
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturing educational services and
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
accommodation food services rounded out
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
the top five and together accounted for
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
more than half the employment in the
 
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.270 align:start position:0%
more than half the employment in the
state

01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
what happened to wages in those sectors
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
well we can have some insight now
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
although the data do lag a little bit
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
the data on slide 34 show the total and
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
then those five sectors i'm comparing
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
weekly wage growth in january to june of
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
20 or probably weekly wage growth in new
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire between
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
the first half of 2019 and the first
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
half of 2021
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
and we see the nominal wage growth so
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
not adjusted for inflation in the solid
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
bar and then in the crosstatch bar
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
inflation-adjusted wage growth
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
and we can see that
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
wages have been growing overall although
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
real wages in particular for
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturing have been the growth has
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
been a little bit more muted um
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
healthcare and social assistance we see
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit more muted growth as well
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
in those wages um and in all these
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
sectors it appears to be you know maybe
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit lower than what we're
 
01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:42.390 align:start position:0%
a little bit lower than what we're
seeing

01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
overall in the economy and combined
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
across the other sectors but again this
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
is comparing the first half of last year
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
to the first half of the year before the
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
pandemic we don't have these granular
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
data from more recent data at least i
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't have access to that but if you
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
look at slide 35 you can see with
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
slightly different categorizations
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
broader categorizations of
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
median wages what's happened to the
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
median wages in these sectors
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
first i want to draw your attention on
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
this graph to the solid the thick solid
 
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:11.669 align:start position:0%
this graph to the solid the thick solid
line

01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
without any markings on it and that is
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
the total private sector median wage
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
this is comparing this is looking month
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
to month with monthly median wage
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
estimates in new hampshire and
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
monthly inflation estimates from the
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
bureau of labor statistics you can see
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
that the median wage in december of 2021
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
is about where it was in january of 2021
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
relative to inflation so median wage
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
growth did not outpace inflation even
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
though there was wage growth over this
 
01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:39.189 align:start position:0%
though there was wage growth over this
year

01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
um however that is a little bit
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
different for some of the industries so
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
we can look at trade transportation
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
utilities that may have outpaced wage
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
growth we have a question and then oh
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely representative aaron
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr uh
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
stat slutten for uh your presentation
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
thus far i my question is i i'm looking
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
at these graphs and i'm trying to
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
think of how
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
wages that
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
may have risen because
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
employers were trying to retain people
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh and and not have them stay home
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
versus you know
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
find another job somewhere else
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
do you see that any of any of the data
 
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
suggests that
 
01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the data the data i think
 
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
especially in the last few months of
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
this past year
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
pretty broadly suggest to me that
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
they're that employers are having
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
trouble finding workers and part of it
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
is workers may for whatever reason be
 
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
opting to keep themselves out of the
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
labor force whether it's for health
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
reasons or because they have other
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
caregiving responsibilities for example
 
01:37:46.159 --> 01:37:47.030 align:start position:0%
caregiving responsibilities for example
um

01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
employer employees may also be moving um
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
either negotiating more with their
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
employers or moving between jobs to seek
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
those higher to seek higher wages if
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
there are other opportunities out there
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
that do offer higher wages i think that
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's part of what we're seeing
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
i think that the the general lack of
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
supply in the labor force
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
and the prospect for continued general
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
lack of supply in the labor force is
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
definitely affecting what we're seeing
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of wage growth particularly in
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
these lower wage sectors that again in
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
the recovery from the great recession
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
didn't see much wage growth to begin
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
with if any real wage growth to begin
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
with so there may be some you know some
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
correction for that that's happening
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
here but i have to believe that there's
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
a very significant sort of short-term
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
impact from the pandemic that we're
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
still seeing sort of shake out if you
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
will in some of these wage figures
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
particularly for low-wage workers so i
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
hope that addressed your question yeah
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you so i'll point um
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
especially in the last few months and
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
again these are preliminary data to
 
01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
leisure and hospitality which includes
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
those accommodation food service workers
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
um and education health services which
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
includes the health care and social
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
assistance workers um that in the last
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
sort of four or four months that we see
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
of 2021 we saw more significant wage
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
growth there again based on these
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
preliminary data
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that does suggest workforce
 
01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
shortages particularly i would say in
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
the health sector as well there's been a
 
01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion of that
 
01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:18.229 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion of that
and

01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:18.239 --> 01:39:19.189 align:start position:0%
and
the

01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
risk of inflation outpacing the wage
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
growth that we see
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
is significant especially for especially
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
for households that may be on more
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
limited incomes or on on fixed incomes
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
or limited growth incomes
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
you can see here these are data on this
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
pie chart on slide 36 from the
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
massachusetts institute of technology's
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
living wage calculator covering roughly
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
2020 and 2021 based on their publication
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
some of these costs that we've already
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
spoken about or that we discussed in the
 
01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:46.719 align:start position:0%
that you discussed in the last
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
presentation food cost for example child
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
care costs housing costs these are
 
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
significant slices of the pie um and as
 
01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
these increase that puts pressure on on
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
everything else if you will
 
01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of in terms of people's ability
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
to afford household expenses
 
01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:03.510 align:start position:0%
to afford household expenses
now

01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
we asked a question in january of 2021
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
about future federal action and how does
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
that support the economy
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
and how does that support the ability of
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
individuals and families to to make ends
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
meet themselves
 
01:40:16.149 --> 01:40:16.159 align:start position:0%
and i think it's worth it to say in
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
summary that those policy responses have
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
been significant and have been very
 
01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:20.870 align:start position:0%
been significant and have been very
helpful

01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at the graph on slide 38
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
this is again the census bureau's
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
household pulse survey
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
this is measuring the per pardon mean
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
the percentage of adults in new
 
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire that said it was somewhat or
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
very difficult to pay for usual
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
household expenses in the last seven
 
01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:38.390 align:start position:0%
household expenses in the last seven
days

01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
and you can see unfortunately we don't
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
have these data again before the
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic or from the earliest part but
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
if you look on the left side of the
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
graph you can see in 2020 that number
 
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
had risen to roughly one in three adults
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
saying it was somewhat or very difficult
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
to pay for those usual household
 
01:40:52.239 --> 01:40:53.430 align:start position:0%
to pay for those usual household
expenses

01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
which is a significant portion of the
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
population clearly
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
then you can see the policy
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
interventions here
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
at the federal level the consolidated
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
appropriations act is what mr white
 
01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
called the december aid package and
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
noted that it didn't have a very
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
eloquent name the consolidated
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
appropriations act is the name for that
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
and you can see that it appeared after
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
that bill and that bill as a reminder
 
01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:17.910 align:start position:0%
that bill and that bill as a reminder
expanded

01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
expanded
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
food assistance benefits under the
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
supplement nutrition assistance program
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
provided the economic impact payments or
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
commonly known as the stimulus checks um
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
also expanded unemployment compensation
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
again as well not to the levels that it
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
had been in 2020 but higher than the
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
levels that would have been
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
you can see that it appeared that that
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
that hardship measure the somewhat or
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
very difficult measure in terms of
 
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
paying for usual household expenses did
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
decline we also see a decline after the
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan act which again
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
kept those unemployment compensation
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
expansions sent out the economic impact
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
payments and had the snap benefit
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
extension increase
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
increase and they extended the increase
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
and then the third line that you'll see
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
on this graph are the american rescue
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
plan acts child tax credit monthly
 
01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:07.990 align:start position:0%
plan acts child tax credit monthly
payments

01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
and these were these were delayed
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
relative to the initial passage of the
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
act but
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
started in mid-july and lasted through
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
mid-december and we can see again
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
there's a reduction in hardship there
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
now uh the economy was also improving
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
through this time so there are
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
definitely other factors but we do see
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
this pattern that suggests that the
 
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
federal economic stimulus had a pretty
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
significant impact on people's ability
 
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
to afford goods
 
01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
including you know these data are from
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire if we look at national
 
01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:35.910 align:start position:0%
new hampshire if we look at national
data

01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
then we can see on slides 39 40 and 41 i
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
layer in different lines that are
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
estimates of poverty
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
so the first slide slide 39 shows
 
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
similar policy interventions although
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
shows also the regular tax credits that
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
are usually delivered around this time
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
of year
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
if you look at the monthly traditional
 
01:42:57.030 --> 01:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
poverty rate on slide 39 estimated by
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
researchers at the university of chicago
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
you can see there's dips in the national
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
poverty rate after each one of those
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
policy interventions
 
01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639 align:start position:0%
layering in
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
the supplemental poverty rate the
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
estimated supplemental poverty rate
 
01:43:13.109 --> 01:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
which is a different the supplemental
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
poverty measure tries to be a little bit
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive in terms of measuring
 
01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:17.830 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive in terms of measuring
costs

01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
researchers at columbia university
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
estimated what the impacts or what that
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
was on a monthly basis and if you look
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
on slide 41 they show
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
what the supplemental poverty rate
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
likely would have been without those
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic-related federal policy
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
interventions and you could see here at
 
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
least based on their model estimates
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
that there's a pretty clear reduction in
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
the poverty rate rel because of those
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic interventions
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
and it's not necessarily a surprise that
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
we see
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
as mr white alluded to that we see these
 
01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:51.189 align:start position:0%
as mr white alluded to that we see these
federal

01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
impacts on
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
on our economy as
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
really being effective economic stimulus
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
not just because of their size but also
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
because of how they were targeted if you
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
look at slide 42 you can see
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
this is these are model these are
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
numbers that are used in moody's
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
analytics modeling that were published
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
in january of 2021 measuring what the
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
impact would be of an additional dollar
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
of expenditure or a reduced dollar in
 
01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.149 align:start position:0%
of expenditure or a reduced dollar in
taxes

01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
of economic stimulus in the first
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2021 relative to the fourth
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
quarter and we can see that there were
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
more stimulative impacts associated with
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
for example uh supplemental nutrition
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
assistance program benefits or food
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
stamp expansion
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
we can see that there were more
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
stimulative impacts associated with
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation increases um
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
associated with aid to state and local
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
governments the earned income tax credit
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
the child tax credit these were all key
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
components of the american rescue plan
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
act and
 
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
as you can see they're targeted at being
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
more economically stimulative it's not
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily a surprise that we've seen
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
this economic growth increase as a
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
result and after
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
these federal aid packages
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
now that's the federal government side
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
what about the state what role will the
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
state play in supporting the recovery
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
and what role has it played
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
well there has been a the state has had
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
a federally enhanced role and many of
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
you are involved in this and have been
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
involved in this
 
01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
first from the cares act coronavirus
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
relief funds that was the 1.25 billion
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
dollars the state received that provided
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
significant aid that was used by the
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
state to provide significant aid to
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
businesses to state services to health
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
and long-term care providers for child
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
care for schools for non-profits for
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
housing these are all touching on these
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
areas that we've discussed as potential
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
areas of economic constraint as well as
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
that immediate relief that we saw
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
delivered in 2020
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's a much longer time horizon for
 
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
the american rescue plan acts fiscal
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
recovery funds that the state has which
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
is a slightly smaller amount of just
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
under a billion dollars you can see in
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
the pie chart
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
roughly how those dollars have been
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
appropriated thus far and again in
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
relatively broad categories
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
obviously not each individual
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
expenditure is represented here and i do
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
want to note also the investments made
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
by um by recent state budgets including
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
in mental health um because mental
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
health has a strong interaction with the
 
01:46:10.629 --> 01:46:10.639 align:start position:0%
workforce um you know keeping the mental
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
health of the population
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
healthier if you will
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
and medicaid reimbursement rates that
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
obviously interacts with the health care
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
workforce as well
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
now what happens to the international
 
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
economy and trade and there's a lot that
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
could be said here and we've just had a
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
longer discussion than i could provide
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
but i think it is worth thinking about
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
especially if we're thinking about state
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
revenues in particular
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
because the the unanswered questions
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
that we have could
 
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
substantially impact state revenues in
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire um whether it's a new
 
01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
variance of covert 19 or some new
 
01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
iteration of the virus
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
and how that impacts
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
other countries that have had different
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
policies particularly china relative to
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
handling the pandemic that could be a
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
significant factor going forward
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
supply chain bottlenecks fossil fuel
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
costs obviously there's some
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
geopolitical considerations with what is
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
happening in eastern europe right now
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
and the reason i mention all these
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
things is because if you look at new
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire's largest state tax revenue
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
source the business profits tax which is
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
the largest tax revenue source by a
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
factor of two in the most
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
in the most recent fiscal year um
 
01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
that is uh heavily dependent on
 
01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
business entities that are filing as
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
water's edge entities so these are
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
entities that have a significant
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
overseas component and are also
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
operating in new hampshire
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
they paid about 60 percent of the
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
business profits tax that was paid in
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
tax year 2019
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
so which are the most recent data that
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
we have from revenue department revenue
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
administration so
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
what happens internationally
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
could definitely have an impact on new
 
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire's state revenue picture
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
and then what happens to commercial
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
property values what happens to tourism
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
what happens in other areas of the
 
01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:51.510 align:start position:0%
what happens in other areas of the
economy

01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
i would say that again this is an
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
evolving picture particularly relative
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
to commercial property and it's not
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
something i watch closely enough to be
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
able to say definitively what trend is
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
happening residential property has
 
01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:01.990 align:start position:0%
happening residential property has
clearly

01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
gone up in value
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
i'll note as you can see on the graph
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
that this is very important for local
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
revenue and local public services
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
the property tax is the local property
 
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
taxes by far the largest source of state
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
of state and local revenue combined
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of tax revenue um and i will
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
say one thing about tourism too
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
is that tourism and we and you heard
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
some discussion last month
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
about how robust the last tourist season
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
particularly last summer has been and i
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
think that may persist especially with
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
remote work enabling more maybe shorter
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
trips to new hampshire people may be
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
able to work on a friday or monday
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
adjacent to a shorter trip
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
and people may be able to live locally
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
more than they would have otherwise but
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
i do wonder one of the key questions i
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
have is what happens to regional tourism
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
we get a lot of tourists in new
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire obviously from the boston
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
metropolitan area from the new york
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
metropolitan area from states like
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
connecticut new jersey massachusetts
 
01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:59.189 align:start position:0%
connecticut new jersey massachusetts
clearly

01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
if we get to a point this summer where
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
more people are more comfortable
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
traveling further say to colorado or
 
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
france for example what does that do to
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
tourism in new hampshire is that a net
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
positive impact because we attract more
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
people from colorado and france or is it
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh is it more of a downward impact
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
relative to what we saw in 2021 when
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
people wanted to stay a little bit more
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
locally so that's a consideration i have
 
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
so part three and i promised part three
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
would be shorter
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
part 3 are some considerations just
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
specific to revenue that didn't fit into
 
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
any part of this presentation earlier
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
one is on as you can see on page 50
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
which shows
 
01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:40.470 align:start position:0%
which shows
the

01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
total sales volume in dollars for
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
single-family homes and condos and then
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
of course delayed by one month the real
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax revenues collected
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
how long does the housing supply last
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
and what does that mean for revenues
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
going forward this is a question that
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
we've been asking for years and we've
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
seen the housing supply constraints
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
become more and more acute so what that
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
does to revenues going forward
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
specifically the real estate transfer
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
taxes i think a key question
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
then on the next slide property taxes
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
the property tax growth has historically
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
outpaced inflation
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
that may not be the case going forward
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
if we have higher inflation you can see
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
on this graph which shows 2009 to 2021
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
the aggregate local property tax
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
commitment in 2021 the number went down
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
um and that's likely federal aid played
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
a role in that but also some of the
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
state budget decisions around more state
 
01:50:32.229 --> 01:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
aid to local governments likely played a
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
role in that as well i don't have a
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
comprehensive set of factors for you but
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's what i see when i look at
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
this but
 
01:50:41.590 --> 01:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
if property taxes do outpace inflation
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh and inflation is squeezing other
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
parts of household budgets what are the
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
property tax implica or what are the
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
implications there for people's ability
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
to pay property taxes and how does that
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
affect the economy too
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
and then on page 52 on slide 52 you'll
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
see u.s corporate profits and i do want
 
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
to note that corporate profits at in the
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
u.s level have gone up quite a bit even
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
in the last few quarters so this is only
 
01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
through quarter 3 of 2021
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
but we've seen really significant growth
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
on the national level
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
and how does that persist how do does
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
that continue does that fall and
 
01:51:17.590 --> 01:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
if you and that's important for new
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire's revenue structure because
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
again talking about the business profits
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
tax if you look at slide 53 we have yes
 
01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:25.669 align:start position:0%
tax if you look at slide 53 we have yes
so

01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:28.229 --> 01:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
what do you suspect is the biggest
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
reason for the large increase in the
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
profits tax
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
in profits tax revenue or in profits tax
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
revenue yes um so i i think that what
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen in business profits tax
 
01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
revenue is really driven by that slide
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
that i just showed around u.s corporate
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
profits and
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
whether that is because there are um i i
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't know enough about the factors at
 
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
the national level to be able to say
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
definitively what one factor is over
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
another but i do think that those
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
national level corporate profit trends
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
are what's driving our business profits
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
tax revenue i hope i'm addressing your
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
question yes
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
i'm more interested in the relationship
 
01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:06.470 align:start position:0%
i'm more interested in the relationship
between

01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
the federal stimuluses
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
increase in the province tax
 
01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think that the federal
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
stimulus is definitely because of the
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
increased business activity and because
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
of the business the shifts in business
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
activity that we've seen as well so that
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
services to goods shift for example um
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
to the extent that that
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
has that both the federal stimulus going
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
to households and the savings that
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
especially higher income households that
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
haven't seen their incomes interrupted
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
have accrued um
 
01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:39.669 align:start position:0%
have accrued um
that

01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
i think that that has likely led to some
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
businesses and we've heard this from the
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration
 
01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
some businesses doing very well in terms
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
of their profits relative to what
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
they've had before because suddenly
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
there's more demand for their goods so
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
there may be businesses that are more
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
service focused that saw lower corporate
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
profits but we saw higher corporate
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
profits especially from businesses where
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
there was suddenly more demand for their
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
goods and they could in some cases
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
charge higher prices as a result um so
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
chairman major i hope that addressed
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
we'll talk later okay that sounds great
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm also happy to take
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
questions during the during the lunch
 
01:53:15.189 --> 01:53:15.199 align:start position:0%
hour i will i will stick around
 
01:53:15.199 --> 01:53:16.390 align:start position:0%
hour i will i will stick around
um

01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
so um slide 53 is just really a
 
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
derivation of what um especially the
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
folks on the ways and means committees
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
are used to seeing with the inverted
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
triangle and department of revenue
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
administration reports um
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
one thing to emphasize there again when
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about u.s corporate
 
01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
profits uh
 
01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
being an important factor the top one
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
tenth of one percent of businesses in
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the amount of taxable profits
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
that they had paid close to 44 of the
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
business profits tax revenue collected
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
in tax year 2019
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
and the top uh 110 uh pardon the top
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
less than one percent paid close to or
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
more than three quarters so put another
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
way you can see on slide 54
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
the top 80 filers paid about 226 million
 
01:54:02.070 --> 01:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
dollars of business profits tax revenue
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
in 2019 and if you add another roughly
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
600 again important key businesses in
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
the state are paying three quarters of
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax there so that
 
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
what happens at the national level with
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
national corporate profits and how they
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
persist is i think really important for
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
the revenue forecast
 
01:54:19.679 --> 01:54:20.390 align:start position:0%
the revenue forecast
so

01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
and speaking of that revenue forecast on
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
slide 55 i put together a short list of
 
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
considerations which i'll run through
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
quickly here um
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
i think the forecast is complicated
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
in part because we've seen so much
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
revenue growth in recent years
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
that understanding the baseline is i
 
01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
think i think
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
somewhat difficult
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2021 revenues were up 13
 
01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 2019 and up 32 from
 
01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:47.510 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 2019 and up 32 from
2015.

01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
2015.
 
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's really significant growth
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
that growth especially the recent growth
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
that we've seen
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
i think is likely to slow as the as
 
01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
economic growth slows and we heard again
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning about some of the
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
economic headwinds um whether
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
there are declines outside of the tax
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
rate reductions that we're that we're
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
seeing in current policy
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
outside of those if you're to set those
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
aside whether revenues decline i don't
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
know or if they just slow down i think
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's a key question
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
the business tax rate reductions and the
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
changes in the business tax bases may
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
make it difficult to evaluate some of
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
those individual policy impacts um the
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
reduction in the meals and rentals tax
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
rate will reduce revenue relative to
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
what it was what it would have been um
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
the interest and dividends tax phase out
 
01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
will reduce revenue relative to what it
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
would have been
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
so that will start to decline over time
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
stock market volatility is obviously
 
01:55:40.709 --> 01:55:40.719 align:start position:0%
also a factor there
 
01:55:40.719 --> 01:55:41.669 align:start position:0%
also a factor there
and

01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
for members of the finance committee i
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
did note that the medicaid enhancement
 
01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
tax revenue increases
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
will likely offset some of the general
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
fund expenditures on medicaid overall
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that's that's an important
 
01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
part of the picture but i don't exactly
 
01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
know where that's going to go going
 
01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:57.750 align:start position:0%
know where that's going to go going
forward

01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
so i have some questions for the economy
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
in 2022
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
does it continue to grow robustly and
 
01:56:03.119 --> 01:56:04.310 align:start position:0%
does it continue to grow robustly and
equitably

01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
equitably
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
or does is growth less inclusive or does
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
it slow or stall
 
01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:10.719 align:start position:0%
and do incomes for households workers
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
and businesses outpace inflation and
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
rising prices i think that's a key
 
01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:15.350 align:start position:0%
rising prices i think that's a key
question

01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
what happens to the size of the
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
workforce and why does the size of the
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
workforce change what are the factors
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
that contribute to that
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
how are critical workforce challenges in
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
key sectors particularly direct health
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
services and child care services how are
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
they addressed going forward
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
does the housing shortage ease
 
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think is again a really key question
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
for not just the people currently in new
 
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire but attracting more people to
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
are there more dangerous sarsko v2
 
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
variants and if there aren't which
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully there won't be
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
what happened what are the changes that
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the economy that are
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
permanent that remain going forward
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
and then how does the state deploy
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
resources including federal funds to
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
support individuals families and the
 
01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:54.790 align:start position:0%
support individuals families and the
economy

01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
and with that um i'll take us back to
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
our key takeaways which we discussed at
 
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
the beginning so i'll uh shorten it here
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
just to say that you know we've seen um
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
we've seen federal assistance really
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
help economic growth but the recovery is
 
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
not complete we're not back at trendline
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
and the recovery has been uneven
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
as we've seen in some of these graphs
 
01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:16.639 align:start position:0%
the workforce constraints are a really
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
significant headwind and then health
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
factors and child care factors are
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
severe limitations as well as some of
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
those long-term trends
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
inflation is you know hopefully a quite
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
a temporary phenomenon but um it's it
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
has definitely impacted household
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
budgets in 2021 and the state has some
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
really significant opportunities
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
especially with flexible available
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
federal resources to help build an
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
equitable and inclusive recovery going
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
forward in the state so thank you very
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
much for your time i know i'm running
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
right up against time so again i'm happy
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
to stick around afterwards and answer
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
questions as well unless you want me to
 
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
take some now
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
thank you phil for uh excellent

thank you uh phil
on

01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
we are coming up next year on the single
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
sales factor
 
01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:13.589 align:start position:0%
sales factor
change

01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
taking an incredible wager on what's
 
01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
going to happen when we exclude
 
01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
capital uh
 
01:58:24.159 --> 01:58:25.669 align:start position:0%
capital uh
and

01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
and wages from the equation
 
01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:30.070 align:start position:0%
and wages from the equation
and

01:58:30.070 --> 01:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
almost all of our money is coming from
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
the richest corporations and the the
 
01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:38.870 align:start position:0%
the richest corporations and the the
corporations

01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
that are multi-state
 
01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:43.109 align:start position:0%
that are multi-state
multi-nation

01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
multi-nation
 
01:58:43.119 --> 01:58:44.629 align:start position:0%
multi-nation
on

01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
we can't get information from dra
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
to deal with this they can't produce it
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
at least not until
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
a year that we already will have been
 
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing this problem do you have
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
any thoughts or could you develop any
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts on
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
what kind of information we could get at
 
01:59:10.070 --> 01:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
the national level that would allow us
 
01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:11.830 align:start position:0%
the national level that would allow us
to

01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
to estimate in some way what's going to
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
happen to our business profit stacks
 
01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so representative family that's a
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
great question and i think the
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
especially given the time constraints
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
the answer that i'll give now is i'm
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
happy to work on developing thoughts and
 
01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
i can get back to you um and to the
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%

representative major thank you and good
 
02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
morning everyone
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing is in an interesting
 
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
position right now if we go back two
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
years to the beginning of the the
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
pandemic most of us were working our way
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
out of a long manufacturing recession
 
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
that began globally around 2015 or 16
 
02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
and just as the uh the pandemic was
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
um we at least in our company we were
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
seeing the best year we had in about
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
four years
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
and then that was cut short
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
when uh covet came so we had a an
 
02:05:48.719 --> 02:05:49.669 align:start position:0%
when uh covet came so we had a an
initial

02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
initial
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
positive response to covid because many
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
of our customers are in the medical
 
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
equipment business so we saw a lot of
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
activity with them but by
 
02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
august of 2020 we had our worst
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
new orders booking month in company
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
history we booked one order for about
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
twenty five hundred dollars and this is
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
for a company that could be shipping
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 250 to 300 000 a month of
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
product so to have an almost zero month
 
02:06:18.070 --> 02:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
was unheard of the interesting thing is
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
nine months later we had almost a record
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
high number of orders
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
so this as i mentioned this is uh the
 
02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
dickens uh
 
02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:28.070 align:start position:0%
dickens uh
manufacturing

02:06:28.070 --> 02:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
sector you know it was the best of times
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
and the worst of times because it all
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
happened so quickly and a lot of
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
companies went through very similar
 
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances that we did we didn't all
 
02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:38.870 align:start position:0%
circumstances that we did we didn't all
have

02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
the response at the same rate at the
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
same time so some peaked early some
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
peaks later
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
um i i know some companies that
 
02:06:48.159 --> 02:06:49.510 align:start position:0%
um i i know some companies that
were

02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
not doing well six months ago when we
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
were seeing a 60 increase in our new
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
bookings and now that company is is
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
seeing records as well so we're uh
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
in this very strange situation where
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
the whole pandemic
 
02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
probably ended up being a net positive
 
02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
thing for most manufacturers because
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
the demand right now is so high with
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
with everything in the economy shutting
 
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
down for for a good portion of the last
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
two years and still with many sectors of
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
the economy not back up to 100 percent
 
02:07:22.149 --> 02:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh we're seeing those who are recovering
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
now ordering at
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
incredibly uh you know long and deep uh
 
02:07:30.550 --> 02:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
levels uh as i mentioned in my comments
 
02:07:32.709 --> 02:07:32.719 align:start position:0%
here we're booking production now for
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
january of 2023. that's how many orders
 
02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
we have we cannot keep up with it
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
we are capacity constrained um not as
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
much for equipment as we are for people
 
02:07:46.229 --> 02:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
we simply cannot find people we never
 
02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
laid off people we operated during
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
the entire pandemic as most
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers did so we were there
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
through the whole thing keeping our
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
operations going but but right now
 
02:08:00.069 --> 02:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of demands out there for
 
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturing people cnc machine
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
operators and others and
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
we we put ads out and we get no response
 
02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:08.790 align:start position:0%
we we put ads out and we get no response
um

02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know or if we do get a response and
 
02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:11.510 align:start position:0%
you know or if we do get a response and
we

02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
you know we we reach out to the people
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
we want to see them they ghost us we
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
never hear back from them and this has
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
been happening now for the past six or
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
eight months so i think you're going to
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
see a lot of manufacturers in a position
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
similar to ours demand is extremely high
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
the labor force is low
 
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
we we can't
 
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
we can't meet the demand i mean we're
 
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
late on everything we're stretching our
 
02:08:35.669 --> 02:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
our lead times out to 26 weeks
 
02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
which is not an enjoyable number to have
 
02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:39.430 align:start position:0%
which is not an enjoyable number to have
but

02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
we've had to prioritize all of our
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
customers because we just can't keep up
 
02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
with everything and i know a lot of
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
companies are in the same same boat on
 
02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:48.639 align:start position:0%
the other hand there's an other shortage
 
02:08:50.310 --> 02:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
which is on the material side and the
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
supply chain issue
 
02:08:54.629 --> 02:08:54.639 align:start position:0%
we're lucky in that we buy a global
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
commodity and the price is going up
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
rapidly right now especially with the
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
with the war in europe
 
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
but we have it available there are many
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
other customers who just can't find raw
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
materials so they could make the stuff
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
that they could find the material to to
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
use but they
 
02:09:11.189 --> 02:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
just can't do it and as i mentioned some
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
are suffering from material shortages
 
02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
some are suffering for labor shortages
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
and some are suffering for both
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
and what happens is many of us are in
 
02:09:21.669 --> 02:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
the supply chain of larger companies so
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
as our lead times go up their lead times
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
go up so we just make that whole supply
 
02:09:28.229 --> 02:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
chain issue even worse
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of companies are trying to
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
overcome the the problem of labor with
 
02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
greater automation
 
02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know trying to
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
automate as much as they can to replace
 
02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
labor if possible and then using newer
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
techniques like i mentioned data
 
02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
analytics artificial intelligence all of
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
these sort sorts of things are coming
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
into play now where we can understand
 
02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
our businesses better try to cut our
 
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
costs try to be more sustainable in our
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
operations everything that we can do to
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
sustain ourselves uh you know through
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
this through this change the national
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
association of manufacturers indicates
 
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:02.870 align:start position:0%
association of manufacturers indicates
that

02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:04.639 align:start position:0%
their expectation is the economy will
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
continue to grow in 2022 for about four
 
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
percent growth which is still pretty
 
02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
pretty aggressive um so we don't see the
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
supply chain issue
 
02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
dissipating for some time it's going to
 
02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
be tough and
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
i see no end in sight for for our
 
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
business in terms of orders
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
exceeding shipments so every month my
 
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
backlog just keeps growing and we work
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
overtime we you know we're trying to
 
02:10:30.550 --> 02:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
find people uh we just can't keep up
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
with it so we we get increasingly behind
 
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
in trying to do things and i think
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
everyone is in that in that position
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
right now so uh manufacturing is still a
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
strong sector in the in the state
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
employing about 70 000 people we'd like
 
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
to employ more if we can um i think
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
you'll see manufacturing companies doing
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
as well as they can with all of the the
 
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
constraints that they have um and i
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
think you know it'll be
 
02:10:56.550 --> 02:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
you know a few years before we can find
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
ourselves in a in a more easy breathing
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
situation than we are right now
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
so next i'm going to introduce neil
 
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
proudman to
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of the utilities and

role in new hampshire's economy the
 
02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
electricity and gas delivered by liberty
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire's other utilities is
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely fundamental to all the
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
economic activity in the state we do
 
02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
everything from heating homes to
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
powering industry
 
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
access to safe affordable and reliable
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
energy is a necessary prerequisite for
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's economic success
 
02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
for me the central challenge facing new
 
02:13:35.189 --> 02:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire's energy economy
 
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
is that the supply and price of our
 
02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:38.550 align:start position:0%
is that the supply and price of our
energy

02:13:38.550 --> 02:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
is not determined here in new hampshire
 
02:13:44.709 --> 02:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
it is determined by forces beyond our
 
02:13:44.719 --> 02:13:45.830 align:start position:0%
it is determined by forces beyond our
borders

02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
borders
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
and in a large part beyond our control
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
which is very frustrating to me
 
02:13:54.550 --> 02:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
by virtue of new hampshire's geographic
 
02:13:58.709 --> 02:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
location we're on the end of a very very
 
02:14:01.589 --> 02:14:01.599 align:start position:0%
long pipeline
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
and and that creates a bottleneck and it
 
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
drives up prices and and the price that
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
customers pay for heating and fuel
 
02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
and electricity which is generated
 
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
primarily by gas-burning power plants is
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
some of the highest in the country and
 
02:14:20.229 --> 02:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
let me give you a quick example i'm
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
going off script now a quick example on
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
the 28th of january there was a trading
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
situation on the last day on the last
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
day of trading
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
at the uh henry hub in louisiana last
 
02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
time i checked that's a long way from
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
reuters and the market analysts didn't
 
02:14:39.910 --> 02:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
know what was happening but there was a
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
spike in trading at the very last minute
 
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
the impact of that spike in trading
 
02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:47.430 align:start position:0%
the impact of that spike in trading
is

02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:48.629 align:start position:0%
is
16

02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
16
 
02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
a month
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
on on on the energy bill of the average
 
02:14:53.599 --> 02:14:54.950 align:start position:0%
on on on the energy bill of the average
residential

02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
residential
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire family
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
now some people would say 16 isn't a lot
 
02:15:02.229 --> 02:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
but but that's not my background and
 
02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
that's not where i come from
 
02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
and i know that when i when i when i
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
when i stand in that line at my local
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
market basket with those new hampshire
 
02:15:11.199 --> 02:15:12.470 align:start position:0%
market basket with those new hampshire
families

02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
families
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire mom can do a lot with 16
 
02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:16.950 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire mom can do a lot with 16
bucks

02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
bucks
 
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know i see a lot of great examples
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
in the last year of of what live free
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
and dime means to granite staters and
 
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
this doesn't feel like it
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
historically as i've said new hampshire
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
tends to have some of the highest energy
 
02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
costs in the country
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
so what can we and state polit
 
02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
policymakers do to reduce this kind of
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
volatility and price risk
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
well firstly we can help energy
 
02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:42.790 align:start position:0%
well firstly we can help energy
consumers

02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
to lower their energy costs through
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency and i'm really pleased
 
02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
that the governor signed house bill 549
 
02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
which established a new robust
 
02:15:56.709 --> 02:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
foundation for cost-effective energy
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
efficiency programmes under the
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
award-winning new hampshire saves it's a
 
02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
time when energy prices are most
 
02:16:06.790 --> 02:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
volatile we have an opportunity to help
 
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
our customers the cheapest energy is the
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
energy you don't use
 
02:16:13.990 --> 02:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
we really appreciate the governor the
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
legislature the department of energy and
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
the office of the consumer advocate our
 
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
fellow utilities and others for coming
 
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
together to help granite staters save
 
02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:24.310 align:start position:0%
together to help granite staters save
money

02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
second we can produce and store our own
 
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
energy right here in new hampshire for
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
example we can optimize the integration
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
of distribution energy resources so they
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
add value for all utility customers a
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
good example of this is liberty's own
 
02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
battery storage pilot program it's a
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
prime example of where third policy
 
02:16:48.309 --> 02:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
developers utilities and customers can
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
work together to reduce costs and
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
enhance electric system resiliency by
 
02:16:58.309 --> 02:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
integrating behind the meter resources
 
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
if implanted correctly community power
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
aggregation aided by reliable access to
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
utility energy data can also help
 
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
and we can do more to insulate new
 
02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire families and businesses from
 
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
the high prices and volatility of the
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
institut in interstate gas transmission
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
system by using
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
local waste streams renewable energy to
 
02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
generate renewable natural gas and clean
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
energy clean hydrogen that can be
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
delivered to customers through our
 
02:17:30.479 --> 02:17:31.669 align:start position:0%
delivered to customers through our
existing

02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
existing
 
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that the ratepayers of
 
02:17:38.070 --> 02:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire have paid for over decades
 
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
we can improve new hampshire's capacity
 
02:17:42.870 --> 02:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
for long
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
duration storage
 
02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
so my third and final point is that we
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
should modernize the process utilities
 
02:17:52.629 --> 02:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
use to plan for the future
 
02:17:55.509 --> 02:17:55.519 align:start position:0%
the existing state statute governing
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
least cost integrated resource planning
 
02:18:01.030 --> 02:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
is really a vestige of the
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated utility days and
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
does little
 
02:18:09.750 --> 02:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
to optimize utility holistic utility
 
02:18:12.629 --> 02:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
system planning to meet the needs of our
 
02:18:12.639 --> 02:18:13.910 align:start position:0%
system planning to meet the needs of our
communities

02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
with the right policy the right
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
collaboration and regulatory framework
 
02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
in place new hampshire new hampshire's
 
02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
energy system can make progress towards
 
02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:27.519 align:start position:0%
a more affordable and resilient future
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
what i'm really saying there
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
is that if we come together as a
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
community like we do
 
02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
and like we did for energy efficiency
 
02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature the department of energy
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
consumer advocates
 
02:18:43.429 --> 02:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
and utilities
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
we combine our talents
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
our energies and through the efficient
 
02:18:48.399 --> 02:18:49.270 align:start position:0%
our energies and through the efficient
use

02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
of our customer funding
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
we can provide ourselves with a buffer
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
from that volatility
 
02:19:00.230 --> 02:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
through a measure of energy independence
 
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
using our own
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire waste for for renewable
 
02:19:08.070 --> 02:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
natural gas using our own new hampshire
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
water to produce hydrogen using our own
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire wind and sunshine and the
 
02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
geothermal heat
 
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
underneath our feet
 
02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
before i close i would be remiss if i
 
02:19:23.429 --> 02:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
didn't call your attention to a key
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
a key issue facing new hampshire
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
businesses including utilities
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
and that's the workforce the existing
 
02:19:33.509 --> 02:19:33.519 align:start position:0%
utility workforce is aging
 
02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
i've been in this industry for four
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:42.629 --> 02:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
what we need is smart hard-working young
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
granite staters who want to stay here
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
and join our workforce
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
and then coupled with that a strategy to
 
02:19:54.309 --> 02:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
attract the best and brightest work
 
02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:55.600 align:start position:0%

on i just wanted to
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
find out if all of the utilities are
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much on board with these ideas
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
i can only speak for liberty right now
 
02:21:24.389 --> 02:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
we do collaborate we certainly
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
collaborate across across the utility
 
02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
industry on energy on energy efficiency
 
02:21:32.230 --> 02:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
and other things but i think we can do
 
02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:33.110 align:start position:0%
and other things but i think we can do
more

02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
so so you're the first audience to hear
 
02:21:37.349 --> 02:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
this message
 
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking forward to not only
 
02:21:40.870 --> 02:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
working across
 
02:21:43.590 --> 02:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
the utility but but also
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
as as i said earlier with the
 
02:21:48.550 --> 02:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
the office of the consumer advocate the
 
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
legislature and the policy makers
 
02:21:53.349 --> 02:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
i think there's a huge opportunity i
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
think it's the low hanging fruit and i
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
think it's the special source that can
 
02:21:58.630 --> 02:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
help us move forward
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%

thank you it's an honor to be here today
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
especially representing the hospitality
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:19.270 --> 02:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
we are in the business of manufacturing
 
02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
hospitality 24 hours a day
 
02:23:24.309 --> 02:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
and one of our biggest challenges is
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
you've heard it previously is this labor
 
02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:27.429 align:start position:0%
you've heard it previously is this labor
force

02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
force
 
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
our culinary indus our culinarians have
 
02:23:30.160 --> 02:23:31.429 align:start position:0%
our culinary indus our culinarians have
been

02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
very hard to find at the balsams we used
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
to have a culinary
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
program there where where we graduated
 
02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
about six or seven professional chefs
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
every year and since the balsams is
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
closed that that has evaporated those
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
that talent has evaporated
 
02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:48.710 align:start position:0%
that talent has evaporated
and

02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's very very difficult uh to find
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
staff but
 
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:55.600 align:start position:0%

when this
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
terrible pandemic
 
02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
hit us
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%

through it all in your courage and
 
02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
leadership new hampshire
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
in my opinion has come out ahead from
 
02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
our neighboring neighbors from our
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
neighbors in new england
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
they kept their
 
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
they didn't open as soon as we did
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
they kept their restrictions in place
 
02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:30.550 align:start position:0%
they kept their restrictions in place
longer

02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
i also sit on a board of directors for
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
all the new england inns and resorts in
 
02:24:35.270 --> 02:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
new england
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
and weekly calls over the last couple
 
02:24:39.190 --> 02:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
years i was
 
02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:40.469 align:start position:0%
years i was
amazed

02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
amazed
 
02:24:40.479 --> 02:24:41.510 align:start position:0%
amazed
that

02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:43.510 --> 02:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the industry were remain
 
02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:44.790 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the industry were remain
closed

02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
closed
 
02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
while we at loon mountain were
 
02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
and that in the long run i think has
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
given us a market marketing advantage in
 
02:24:57.750 --> 02:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
the in the tourism industry for for our
 
02:25:01.270 --> 02:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:04.230 --> 02:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
restaurant industry received a lot of
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
support as well as lodging without the
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
support from the federal government and
 
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
from the state of new hampshire
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think we would have made it
 
02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
but we seem to be on the other side of
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
this pandemic
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
the restaurant industry is still
 
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
i believe going to struggle as
 
02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
the cases rise and drop
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're hoping our municipalities will
 
02:25:30.309 --> 02:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
allow us to keep outdoor seating
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh available for at least the next
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
couple years i think you and your
 
02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
positions you're going to see
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
swings in the
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
laundry and meals tax
 
02:25:43.990 --> 02:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
swing more in the off seasons than you
 
02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
maybe did before especially late summer
 
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
early winter because i believe the cases
 
02:25:51.590 --> 02:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
will will rise again and when that
 
02:25:54.750 --> 02:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
happens it has an impact on our business
 
02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:57.429 align:start position:0%
happens it has an impact on our business

02:26:03.030 --> 02:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
the covet thing is not we believe is not
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
going to go away
 
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
and it's fascinating and it's very good
 
02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
news that we're being told now we're
 
02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
going to probably live with it and
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
manage it which is all good news
 
02:26:16.469 --> 02:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
without those guests coming from
 
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and new hampshire
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
some of your finest resorts in america
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
will be struggling and we employ a lot
 
02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
of people
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
most of your industries that you're
 
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
going to hear from today a lot of those
 
02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
people that are leaders in those
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
industries started in our industry let
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
it be a high school student or college
 
02:26:36.399 --> 02:26:37.349 align:start position:0%
it be a high school student or college
student

02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that's where we have to find our
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
next workforce and
 
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
the biggest challenge will be finding
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
that workforce and
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has always led very
 
02:26:51.429 --> 02:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
strongly in our in hospitality
 
02:26:57.030 --> 02:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
let's see um
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's my pleasure to be here today
 
02:27:04.389 --> 02:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
in the future you're probably going to
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
see more
 
02:27:08.469 --> 02:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
of our restaurants go to a product grab
 
02:27:09.429 --> 02:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
and go
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
where you order and you come in and you
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
pick up your product
 
02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
and maybe less dining inside
 
02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
when you go to a hotel you might be
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
greeted with a kiosk where you check in
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
without a person to welcome you
 
02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:23.830 align:start position:0%
without a person to welcome you
and

02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:26.469 --> 02:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
and that is largely due to technology as
 
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
well as the shortage of labor
 
02:27:31.030 --> 02:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
it goes against my grain i grew up in
 
02:27:32.309 --> 02:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
this industry
 
02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i love new hampshire because
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
believe it or not new hampshire
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
hospitality is real hospitality it's
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
real people delivering this day in and
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
day out and we all believe in it and
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
that is really how we've grown our
 
02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
revenues at the mountain club on loon
 
02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's you have to develop the product you
 
02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
have to create a team of hospitality
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
people that that have smiles
 
02:27:56.230 --> 02:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
and your clientele will come back year
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
after year
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
and as as we go through this shortage of
 
02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:01.590 align:start position:0%
and as as we go through this shortage of
labor

02:28:01.590 --> 02:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
labor
 
02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
some of those smiles might diminish and
 
02:28:05.349 --> 02:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
we have a tremendous amount of people
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
working six and seven days a week
 
02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:09.670 align:start position:0%
working six and seven days a week
and

02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:12.389 --> 02:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
in order to keep the places open but i
 
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
know we're not going to fix that today
 
02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:17.910 align:start position:0%
know we're not going to fix that today
and

02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
our futures will depend on our
 
02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
reputation so it is my pleasure and
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
honor to be here today and and thank you

um

02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
i'm here to speak about the challenges
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
that we are facing here at dartmouth
 
02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
hitchcock health and they're largely
 
02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
going to echo
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
what you've already heard
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
the challenges that we are facing at
 
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock
 
02:29:55.030 --> 02:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
they're on several fronts but most
 
02:29:57.910 --> 02:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
notably around staffing issues expense
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
growth from salaries and supplies and
 
02:30:02.790 --> 02:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
affordable housing for our staff
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
these issues are of course intertwined
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
with each other but staffing issues
 
02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
especially for nurses and other clinical
 
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
providers directly impacts our ability
 
02:30:14.309 --> 02:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
to provide care at full capacity
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
the need for the services we provide at
 
02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
all of our member hospitals has never
 
02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
been greater
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
this is especially true at
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
dartmouth-hitchcock medical center in
 
02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:23.910 align:start position:0%
dartmouth-hitchcock medical center in
lebanon

02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
lebanon
 
02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
the state's only academic medical center
 
02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
level one trauma center where often
 
02:30:30.150 --> 02:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
demand for our services outpaces our
 
02:30:32.469 --> 02:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
ability to provide it even under normal
 
02:30:32.479 --> 02:30:34.389 align:start position:0%
ability to provide it even under normal
circumstances

02:30:34.389 --> 02:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
however these are not normal times as
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
you surely know
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
as you surely know after two years of
 
02:30:42.550 --> 02:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
the pandemic clinical providers are
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
feeling burnout and fatigue
 
02:30:46.630 --> 02:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
many have retired or left their
 
02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
healthcare career
 
02:30:49.750 --> 02:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
in the nursing space this is
 
02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
exacerbating a pre-covet 19 shortage
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
that was already making it difficult to
 
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
recruit new nurses
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
across dhh we are taking steps to
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain workers especially
 
02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
clinical workers including taking steps
 
02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
such as increasing pay and offering
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
signing bonuses
 
02:31:09.270 --> 02:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals around the country are doing
 
02:31:12.150 --> 02:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
the same so the competition for workers
 
02:31:14.469 --> 02:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
is very intense
 
02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
our efforts to recruit workers from out
 
02:31:17.990 --> 02:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the area has been complicated by a
 
02:31:19.830 --> 02:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
severe lack of affordable housing
 
02:31:22.630 --> 02:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
options especially in lebanon but also
 
02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
in keene home to chester medical center
 
02:31:27.349 --> 02:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
in grafton new hampshire recent data
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
shows that one bedroom apartments have
 
02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
rents of 1800
 
02:31:33.190 --> 02:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
per month and two bedroom units are
 
02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
twenty two hundred dollars per month
 
02:31:37.910 --> 02:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
using conservative metrics
 
02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
these rents are five to six hundred
 
02:31:42.389 --> 02:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
dollars per month above what would be
 
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
considered affordable
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
at dh we've had several instances where
 
02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
new workers
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
from out of the area have accepted a job
 
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
only to rescind the acceptance later
 
02:31:55.190 --> 02:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
when they come to the air to secure
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
housing and can't find it
 
02:31:59.190 --> 02:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
we also know that many of our staff
 
02:32:01.349 --> 02:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
drive long distances to work because of
 
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing shortage
 
02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
at dh we are taking on these challenges
 
02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
head on as best we can thinking boldly
 
02:32:10.550 --> 02:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
and creatively but they are causing
 
02:32:13.030 --> 02:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
significant pressures on our expenses
 
02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
i mentioned earlier the high demand for

services at dhmc
 
02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
to meet that demand we are in the
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
process of building a new patient
 
02:32:19.439 --> 02:32:20.469 align:start position:0%
process of building a new patient
pavilion

02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
pavilion
 
02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
that will add 64 desperately needed beds
 
02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
and opened in about a year
 
02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
to finance this project we borrowed 125
 
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars and will incur almost
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars a year of
 
02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
additional interest expense as a result
 
02:32:35.910 --> 02:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
we will of course have to staff these
 
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
new beds with even more already hard to
 
02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
find clinical workers
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
to track these workers we have increased
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
salaries to new applicants
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
which has led us to increase salaries to
 
02:32:48.790 --> 02:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
existing staff
 
02:32:51.270 --> 02:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
like most hospitals dhh turns to
 
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
traveling nurses to fill
 
02:32:54.790 --> 02:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh staffing gaps when we can't find
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
enough nurses but this resource has also
 
02:32:58.710 --> 02:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
been severely disrupted in this
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
environment the supply of available
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
traveling nurses has been more limited
 
02:33:04.150 --> 02:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
during covid
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
especially during the recent spike
 
02:33:08.950 --> 02:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
while that access has improved somewhat
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
the cost of a traveling nurse is very
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
high so far this fiscal year dhmc's
 
02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
traveler expense has increased by 40
 
02:33:18.550 --> 02:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
percent over last year due to both the
 
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
increased use of travelers and the
 
02:33:23.429 --> 02:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
increased cost per traveler
 
02:33:25.030 --> 02:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
on the housing front we are actively
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
helping workers secure secure housing a
 
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
time-consuming and expensive process
 
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
we are also trying to think creatively
 
02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
as to how we can help encourage and
 
02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
facilitate the construction of new
 
02:33:37.270 --> 02:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
affordable housing units in our area
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
working collaboratively with other
 
02:33:40.710 --> 02:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
employers in the region
 
02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
we have also invested 3 million dollars
 
02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire community loan fund
 
02:33:47.270 --> 02:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
these efforts are vital but they are
 
02:33:49.349 --> 02:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
costly whether it be from increased
 
02:33:51.590 --> 02:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
salary expense increased recruitment
 
02:33:54.070 --> 02:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
expense increased interest expense
 
02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
increase traveler expense
 
02:33:59.270 --> 02:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
and other increased operating expenses
 
02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
our total expenses are up almost nine
 
02:34:03.830 --> 02:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
percent from a year ago
 
02:34:05.590 --> 02:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
but it does not even begin to fully
 
02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
capture the increases in our expenses as
 
02:34:09.030 --> 02:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
they are still bleeding into our into
 
02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
our operations
 
02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
at dhh we simply don't have the ability
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
to pass these expenses on like some
 
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
industries do we absorb all of those
 
02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:19.110 align:start position:0%
industries do we absorb all of those
expenses

02:34:19.110 --> 02:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:20.870 align:start position:0%
expenses
ourselves

02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
02:34:22.469 --> 02:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
so our leadership team continues to
 
02:34:22.479 --> 02:34:24.150 align:start position:0%
so our leadership team continues to
innovate

02:34:24.150 --> 02:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
innovate
 
02:34:27.270 --> 02:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
seek efficiency and think boldly
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
being fully staffed with a staff of
 
02:34:32.230 --> 02:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
highly capable highly engaged people is
 
02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
mission critical for us
 
02:34:36.230 --> 02:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
and we are determined to succeed but it
 
02:34:38.550 --> 02:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
is very challenging at the moment we are
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
doing everything we can to make people
 
02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
want to come work at dhh we are doing
 
02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
everything we can to make people want to
 
02:34:46.309 --> 02:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
come live in new hampshire
 
02:34:47.590 --> 02:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing everything we can to take
 
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
care of our patients to take care of our
 
02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:50.389 align:start position:0%
care of our patients to take care of our
community

02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:59.670 --> 02:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you mr chairman that concludes
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh our speakers we're happy to use the
 
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
rest of our time to respond uh to
 
02:35:06.389 --> 02:35:06.399 align:start position:0%
questions or or comments
 
02:35:08.790 --> 02:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
fine the first is from uh representative
 
02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
browning i got questions for you but
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
i'll do one and a lot of us ask
 
02:35:14.630 --> 02:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
questions and we'll see if we can we can
 
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
do mike can we start with you so i i
 
02:35:19.270 --> 02:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
maybe i read this wrong but i thought
 
02:35:21.349 --> 02:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line that dartmouth
 
02:35:23.590 --> 02:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
hitchcock was looking at
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
kind of getting in the landlord business
 
02:35:27.429 --> 02:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
and developing some affordable
 
02:35:30.309 --> 02:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
apartments for staff is did i did i hear
 
02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
that wrong
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
is that something you dabbled with uh it
 
02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:34.950 align:start position:0%
is that something you dabbled with uh it
just

02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's not a panacea because i i
 
02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:37.910 align:start position:0%
it's not a panacea because i i
understand

02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:35:40.469 --> 02:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
but did i hear that right or so we did
 
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
put out we did put out an rfp a few
 
02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
months ago uh to
 
02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
possibly partner with a builder who
 
02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
would use some land that we were willing
 
02:35:51.830 --> 02:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
to lease to them but you give them okay
 
02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:52.950 align:start position:0%
to lease to them but you give them okay
um

02:35:52.950 --> 02:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:55.270 --> 02:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh what we decided was that was going to
 
02:35:56.550 --> 02:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
actually end up being it wasn't going to
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
work really we weren't going to be able
 
02:36:00.230 --> 02:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
to get affordable
 
02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh units unless we put in a substantial
 
02:36:05.910 --> 02:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
equity uh commitment ourselves which
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
we're not quite ready to do so we're
 
02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
we're still trying to think of
 
02:36:11.349 --> 02:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
short-term solutions that will help
 
02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
help bring people in now while we assess
 
02:36:15.670 --> 02:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
whether this is going to be a long-term
 
02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
problem or not so that's on hold right
 
02:36:19.349 --> 02:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
now that project okay
 
02:36:21.750 --> 02:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you that clarifies that appreciate
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that uh
 
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
representing elmi
 
02:36:27.910 --> 02:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you this is kind of a local issue
 
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
but i think it may be going on all over
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'm from lebanon uh
 
02:36:36.950 --> 02:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:38.389 align:start position:0%
 
dartmouth

02:36:38.389 --> 02:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
dartmouth
 
02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
tries to expand its student body without
 
02:36:44.469 --> 02:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
expanding uh housing in the dartmouth
 
02:36:44.479 --> 02:36:45.429 align:start position:0%
expanding uh housing in the dartmouth
area

02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
and we end up losing a lot of our
 
02:36:51.670 --> 02:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
workforce in lebanon
 
02:36:54.710 --> 02:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
we are filled with startups
 
02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
and when you were going to build that
 
02:37:01.030 --> 02:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
building which we all we permitted uh
 
02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
very quickly i think uh
 
02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:08.790 align:start position:0%
very quickly i think uh
to

02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
to house the people that are in that new
 
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
74 bed unit
 
02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:14.790 align:start position:0%
74 bed unit
on

02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:15.830 align:start position:0%
on
that

02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
would have worked but now there is going
 
02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
nowhere near enough housing for the
 
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
people that are running all of these
 
02:37:29.190 --> 02:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
high-tech creative startups in little
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
places all over lebanon
 
02:37:34.710 --> 02:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
and the existing larger
 
02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:35.710 align:start position:0%
and the existing larger
uh

02:37:35.710 --> 02:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:37.429 align:start position:0%
uh
manufacturing

02:37:37.429 --> 02:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
that we have in lebanon and the hospital
 
02:37:43.429 --> 02:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
and dartmouth college overflow which is
 
02:37:43.439 --> 02:37:44.630 align:start position:0%
and dartmouth college overflow which is
also

02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
you have a question on that too
 
02:37:55.750 --> 02:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
the question is what can we possibly
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
do i think this is probably a problem
 
02:38:01.590 --> 02:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
all over the state what can we possibly
 
02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:02.389 align:start position:0%
all over the state what can we possibly
do

02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:38:02.399 --> 02:38:03.590 align:start position:0%
do
to

02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:04.950 align:start position:0%
to
avoid

02:38:04.950 --> 02:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
damaging our existing economy as we grow
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
in different
 
02:38:12.070 --> 02:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
try to grow in different parts of it
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
that are larger like dartmouth hitchcock
 
02:38:16.150 --> 02:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
is and can
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:22.389 --> 02:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and that's thank you for
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
the question um from you know my
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
perspective this issue hasn't gone away
 
02:38:28.309 --> 02:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
for us when i say we're not moving on
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
with that project it's not because the
 
02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
problem went away
 
02:38:32.469 --> 02:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
it's still
 
02:38:34.710 --> 02:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
it's still a big problem we are we are
 
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
working with the developers in the area
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
we are working with other developers
 
02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
outside the area that might come in with
 
02:38:42.469 --> 02:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
a different approach maybe more of a
 
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
non-profit approach that could help get
 
02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:45.590 align:start position:0%
non-profit approach that could help get
more

02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:38:47.830 --> 02:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
units built so we're not
 
02:38:49.510 --> 02:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
we're not by any means walking away from
 
02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
the situation because we can't
 
02:38:53.349 --> 02:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
we we need to be able to have people
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
come in
 
02:38:54.240 --> 02:38:55.830 align:start position:0%
come in
um

02:38:55.830 --> 02:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:58.230 --> 02:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not a policy person so i'll just say
 
02:38:59.830 --> 02:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the answer is but if
 
02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
you guys have answers to help us get uh
 
02:39:03.349 --> 02:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
affordable housing bill
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
that would help
 
02:39:07.750 --> 02:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative ames followed by
 
02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:09.670 align:start position:0%
okay representative ames followed by
senator

02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
senator
 
02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:14.950 align:start position:0%
senator
roosevelt

02:39:14.950 --> 02:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:17.110 --> 02:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you i actually have two questions
 
02:39:18.790 --> 02:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
but i'll put off the second as
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative abrami did
 
02:39:26.230 --> 02:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
until it's my turn again uh so uh
 
02:39:28.309 --> 02:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
valzan santrok
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
02:39:32.550 --> 02:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
a business operating in my town of
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
jeffrey um
 
02:39:37.429 --> 02:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
side by side almost side by side with
 
02:39:37.439 --> 02:39:39.590 align:start position:0%
side by side almost side by side with
millipore

02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
millipore
 
02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
so relatively small manufacturer
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
and a very big manufacturer expanding
 
02:39:50.830 --> 02:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
my question to you i don't know
 
02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
how the business enterprise tax and
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
business profits tax
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
interact with you in particular
 
02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
but as you know
 
02:40:04.150 --> 02:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
we are moving to a single sales factor
 
02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
for the business profits tax
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
and i know that as we've tried to figure
 
02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
out the impact of this
 
02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
which is very difficult to do
 
02:40:16.389 --> 02:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
we see
 
02:40:19.429 --> 02:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
large manufacturers at least as
 
02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
primarily selling out
 
02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire to other places
 
02:40:28.469 --> 02:40:28.479 align:start position:0%
and we're fearful that going to a single
 
02:40:31.030 --> 02:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
sales factor
 
02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
will at least in those cases
 
02:40:36.150 --> 02:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
hurt our revenues
 
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't know whether that
 
02:40:42.070 --> 02:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
translates as as well to a smaller
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturer it really depends on what
 
02:40:45.590 --> 02:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
your market is but i wonder if you could
 
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
02:40:50.389 --> 02:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
this issue that we're struggling with
 
02:40:53.190 --> 02:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
well as a small company relatively small
 
02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:54.389 align:start position:0%
well as a small company relatively small
company

02:40:54.389 --> 02:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
company
 
02:40:54.399 --> 02:40:56.710 align:start position:0%
company
interestingly

02:40:56.710 --> 02:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
interestingly
 
02:40:58.630 --> 02:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
business profits tax business enterprise
 
02:41:02.469 --> 02:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
tax are not a big part of my concern uh
 
02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
local property taxes far exceed
 
02:41:08.230 --> 02:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
those other taxes and uh you know being
 
02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
small company we have a marginal profit
 
02:41:13.750 --> 02:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
so you know the impact of those taxes to
 
02:41:14.710 --> 02:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
us is
 
02:41:16.150 --> 02:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's not something that you know we
 
02:41:18.309 --> 02:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
really take into a lot of consideration
 
02:41:20.790 --> 02:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
we take advantage of the r d tax credit
 
02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
which we can do and use that to help
 
02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
mitigate the tax but it's
 
02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
local property taxes
 
02:41:30.469 --> 02:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
those those taxes really don't affect us
 
02:41:32.309 --> 02:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
that much and i don't i don't make any
 
02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
business decisions
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know driven by taxes
 
02:41:38.790 --> 02:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking more at what makes sense
 
02:41:40.230 --> 02:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
for our business and where we need to
 
02:41:41.830 --> 02:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
make investments and whatever and you
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
know the taxes come as they come but
 
02:41:46.309 --> 02:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
they're not that large for us so it's
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:51.990 --> 02:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
02:41:57.030 --> 02:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:42:03.190 --> 02:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:42:04.399 --> 02:42:05.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

02:42:05.110 --> 02:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:07.190 --> 02:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing a lot from the
 
02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals across the state and i'm from
 
02:42:12.309 --> 02:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
nashua so we've got two and they're not
 
02:42:14.230 --> 02:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
critical access
 
02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:15.750 align:start position:0%
critical access
that

02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:17.429 align:start position:0%
that
their

02:42:17.429 --> 02:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
their operating revenues are
 
02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:23.110 align:start position:0%
their operating revenues are
struggling

02:42:23.110 --> 02:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
because they've had to cut back
 
02:42:27.429 --> 02:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
on elective
 
02:42:27.439 --> 02:42:29.670 align:start position:0%
on elective
procedures

02:42:29.670 --> 02:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons so
 
02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
i've noticed at the same time though the
 
02:42:38.230 --> 02:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
estimated met revenues are up pretty
 
02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:39.830 align:start position:0%
estimated met revenues are up pretty
significantly

02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
from plan so i wonder if you could just
 
02:42:45.510 --> 02:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
help me understand why
 
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
the hospitals are
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
struggling on revenues and yet
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
their net
 
02:42:54.309 --> 02:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
patient service revenues that are taxed
 
02:42:57.590 --> 02:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:59.190 --> 02:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
i may have to get back to you on that
 
02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not close to the just in my role the
 
02:43:03.750 --> 02:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
close to how the med is calculated so i
 
02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
think i'd be speaking out of turn if i
 
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
tried to answer that
 
02:43:07.750 --> 02:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
but i can
 
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
roxanna mooney
 
02:43:13.830 --> 02:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
gentlemen for being here today
 
02:43:18.630 --> 02:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
interested to know of the qualified
 
02:43:21.830 --> 02:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
employees you do hire and that you do
 
02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:22.870 align:start position:0%
employees you do hire and that you do
employ

02:43:22.870 --> 02:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
employ
 
02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
do you have just an informal breakdown
 
02:43:28.389 --> 02:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
of how many are from out of state and
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
how many from new hampshire would that
 
02:43:32.790 --> 02:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
be possible to
 
02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:40.950 --> 02:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
i can give a quick overview at least in
 
02:43:43.269 --> 02:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
jeffrey offering
 
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing jobs um you know we're
 
02:43:45.920 --> 02:43:47.110 align:start position:0%
manufacturing jobs um you know we're
paying

02:43:47.110 --> 02:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
paying
 
02:43:50.710 --> 02:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
entry level workers about 17 an hour
 
02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:51.830 align:start position:0%
entry level workers about 17 an hour
um

02:43:51.830 --> 02:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:54.550 --> 02:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
and if you look at 17 an hour
 
02:43:57.030 --> 02:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
to maybe 21 or 22
 
02:43:58.710 --> 02:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
you know you look at the economic
 
02:44:01.510 --> 02:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
distance that that wage supports and
 
02:44:03.269 --> 02:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
maybe you can get a 40-minute commute in
 
02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
there before you start seeing you know
 
02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of commuting
 
02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
competing with what the with what the
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
hourly wages so in our case just about
 
02:44:13.830 --> 02:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
everybody is within 40 minutes of where
 
02:44:15.750 --> 02:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
we are we may get a couple of people
 
02:44:16.710 --> 02:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
coming over the border from
 
02:44:18.309 --> 02:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
massachusetts just because we're so
 
02:44:18.319 --> 02:44:19.110 align:start position:0%
massachusetts just because we're so
close

02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
close
 
02:44:20.469 --> 02:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
but for us
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
we recruit locally
 
02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
we have some people who walk to work
 
02:44:26.710 --> 02:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
which is a nice situation
 
02:44:28.469 --> 02:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
we have a pretty good contingent from
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
the keene area so they have about a half
 
02:44:31.590 --> 02:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
hour drive but
 
02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
anything more than a 40-minute commute
 
02:44:35.190 --> 02:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense and for the type of
 
02:44:36.550 --> 02:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
job that we have where the people are
 
02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
making with overtime and whatever 40 45
 
02:44:40.950 --> 02:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
000 a year
 
02:44:42.309 --> 02:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
you know we're not recruiting from out
 
02:44:43.990 --> 02:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
of state for to try to fill those jobs
 
02:44:45.750 --> 02:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
so we have to try to look to the local
 
02:44:47.349 --> 02:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
community to supply
 
02:44:50.790 --> 02:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:52.870 --> 02:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
just quickly for liberty i would say the
 
02:44:55.590 --> 02:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
vast majority of our employees all work
 
02:44:57.750 --> 02:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
all live in in new hampshire we like to
 
02:44:59.190 --> 02:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
think of ourselves as the fourth
 
02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
emergency service so when
 
02:45:02.550 --> 02:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know when the weather comes in and
 
02:45:03.750 --> 02:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
the wires
 
02:45:05.349 --> 02:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
the wires are crackling on the floor we
 
02:45:07.269 --> 02:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
need to respond quickly the same
 
02:45:09.269 --> 02:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
kind of situation when we have a gas
 
02:45:12.389 --> 02:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
leak so all of our folks need to be
 
02:45:14.550 --> 02:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
close to be able to respond in a timely
 
02:45:16.469 --> 02:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
way and uh
 
02:45:18.469 --> 02:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
and make sure out that our system is
 
02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
safe and we can serve our customers so i
 
02:45:22.150 --> 02:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
moved to new hampshire on the very first
 
02:45:23.590 --> 02:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
day of my job
 
02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
i would say the vast majority of our
 
02:45:30.389 --> 02:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:37.030 --> 02:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
the majority of our employees are from
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and they live within a
 
02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
half hour drive of lincoln
 
02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
but what we have
 
02:45:47.269 --> 02:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
been faced with where we cannot find
 
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
enough employees we
 
02:45:51.910 --> 02:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
are using the h-2b visa program
 
02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
whereby we are bringing in
 
02:45:56.950 --> 02:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere from eight to twelve employees
 
02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
each season when i see a season it's a
 
02:46:01.190 --> 02:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
winter and a summer season
 
02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:02.150 align:start position:0%
winter and a summer season
and

02:46:02.150 --> 02:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:03.590 --> 02:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
we've also
 
02:46:05.429 --> 02:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
increased our beginning wage to eighteen
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour and
 
02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
in 2022 we'll pay legal fees
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
of about forty thousand dollars
 
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
for that h-2b program
 
02:46:18.630 --> 02:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at that and saying
 
02:46:20.710 --> 02:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
we'd be better off to pay that to the
 
02:46:20.720 --> 02:46:21.750 align:start position:0%
we'd be better off to pay that to the
local

02:46:21.750 --> 02:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
local
 
02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:23.190 align:start position:0%
local
employees

02:46:23.190 --> 02:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:25.750 align:start position:0%
rather than
to

02:46:25.750 --> 02:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:46:27.429 --> 02:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
law firms to bring in the foreign
 
02:46:27.439 --> 02:46:28.469 align:start position:0%
law firms to bring in the foreign
workers

02:46:28.469 --> 02:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
workers
 
02:46:30.550 --> 02:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
the advantage of the foreign workers you
 
02:46:33.190 --> 02:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
you get them for six months
 
02:46:36.230 --> 02:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
and they're they're basically with you
 
02:46:38.389 --> 02:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
versus in this economy
 
02:46:40.630 --> 02:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
we find ourselves stealing from each
 
02:46:43.510 --> 02:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
other we used to steal customers
 
02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
now we steal employees uh and everybody
 
02:46:47.670 --> 02:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
has to make a living and
 
02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:48.710 align:start position:0%
has to make a living and
and

02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:51.030 --> 02:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes 50 cents an hour
 
02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:52.230 align:start position:0%
sometimes 50 cents an hour
is

02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:46:54.070 --> 02:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
that people will leave you but to answer
 
02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
your question we hire mostly people for
 
02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:05.670 --> 02:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
i'd say for us i don't have exact
 
02:47:07.190 --> 02:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
percentages or anything like that but in
 
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
terms of the new employees that we are
 
02:47:11.030 --> 02:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
hiring it's it's both in the state and
 
02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
from out of the state we are
 
02:47:15.429 --> 02:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
like i said we're pretty desperate for
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
nurses so wherever we can get them
 
02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:18.309 align:start position:0%
nurses so wherever we can get them
um

02:47:18.309 --> 02:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:19.830 --> 02:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
we're having to come in my my
 
02:47:21.830 --> 02:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law had surgery
 
02:47:23.429 --> 02:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
uh two weeks ago
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
her nurse had recently moved from from
 
02:47:26.399 --> 02:47:29.590 align:start position:0%
her nurse had recently moved from from
maine

02:47:29.590 --> 02:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
02:47:33.830 --> 02:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
sorry just another comment there
 
02:47:35.830 --> 02:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative talked about the
 
02:47:37.429 --> 02:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
competition i have in jaffrey with a
 
02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
large manufacturer who's
 
02:47:42.389 --> 02:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
trying to hire something like 300 people
 
02:47:44.309 --> 02:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh for a small manufacturer small
 
02:47:45.670 --> 02:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
business right now
 
02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
with the the workforce being the way it
 
02:47:51.990 --> 02:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
is the wage pressure is incredible so um
 
02:47:54.150 --> 02:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
getting back to your tax questions our
 
02:47:56.550 --> 02:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
our wages our wage rates are going up to
 
02:47:58.870 --> 02:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
stay competitive in our local area uh
 
02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
which means the more we pay for labor
 
02:48:02.710 --> 02:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
the less profit we have at the end of
 
02:48:04.870 --> 02:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
the year so you're going to see you know
 
02:48:07.429 --> 02:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
some mitigating factors i think as wages
 
02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
go up and we can't raise our prices fast
 
02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
enough to compensate for all that we're
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
just going to see profits drop so
 
02:48:15.190 --> 02:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
another thing to consider when you're
 
02:48:18.070 --> 02:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
looking at your tax policy
 
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay no question representative romney
 
02:48:23.269 --> 02:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
yep this is for you uh
 
02:48:23.279 --> 02:48:24.790 align:start position:0%
yep this is for you uh
neil

02:48:24.790 --> 02:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
neil
 
02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:26.790 align:start position:0%
neil
so

02:48:26.790 --> 02:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:28.309 --> 02:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
when people ask me what was one of the
 
02:48:31.910 --> 02:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
top issues over the years i've always
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
said high energy costs in new hampshire
 
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
02:48:37.269 --> 02:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
and obviously it hasn't gotten any
 
02:48:37.279 --> 02:48:38.550 align:start position:0%
and obviously it hasn't gotten any
better

02:48:38.550 --> 02:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:39.750 align:start position:0%
better
um

02:48:39.750 --> 02:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
we have lint lint chocolate you know my
 
02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
town of stratum
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
about five six years ago there was an
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
editorial and local paper saying these
 
02:48:48.550 --> 02:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
energy costs are so much they're making
 
02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
us uncompetitive that to me that was a
 
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
shot over the bow
 
02:48:56.150 --> 02:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
but they stayed and they they continue
 
02:48:57.670 --> 02:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
to expand which they've been a good
 
02:48:59.590 --> 02:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
neighbor to us and stratum
 
02:49:01.510 --> 02:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
they're swiss companies you know
 
02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:02.790 align:start position:0%
they're swiss companies you know
so

02:49:02.790 --> 02:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:05.429 --> 02:49:05.439 align:start position:0%
but that's there's this backdrop so
 
02:49:07.510 --> 02:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
but i was interested in hearing more
 
02:49:10.309 --> 02:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
about this clean clean hydrogen
 
02:49:13.750 --> 02:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned uh to me hydrogen you
 
02:49:16.389 --> 02:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
know green energy is all fun and good
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
but the sony shines you know half today
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
um and it's all about potential energy
 
02:49:22.389 --> 02:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
and kinetic energy
 
02:49:24.870 --> 02:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
and you know when the sun's shining we
 
02:49:27.030 --> 02:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
have we can have plenty of solar energy
 
02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:28.150 align:start position:0%
have we can have plenty of solar energy
but

02:49:28.150 --> 02:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:49:30.630 --> 02:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
but do we use it all you know does it go
 
02:49:32.469 --> 02:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
to waste so
 
02:49:34.870 --> 02:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
isn't there a way of converting that
 
02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
that energy to potential energy in a
 
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
form of hydrogen
 
02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:41.110 align:start position:0%
form of hydrogen
by

02:49:41.110 --> 02:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:49:44.950 --> 02:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
refraction and from water of all sources
 
02:49:46.630 --> 02:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh is that what you had in mind here is
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
that what you're talking about yeah so
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
so as an industry across the world
 
02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
across the world
 
02:49:54.389 --> 02:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
the gas industry the gas industry during
 
02:49:57.030 --> 02:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
the 60s repurposed itself from the old
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
tam gas which interestingly enough uh
 
02:50:02.230 --> 02:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
hydrogen was involved in that process to
 
02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
to natural gas
 
02:50:05.750 --> 02:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
now we're finding that for a whole host
 
02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
of reasons not least climate change and
 
02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:10.150 align:start position:0%
of reasons not least climate change and
decarbonization

02:50:10.150 --> 02:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
decarbonization
 
02:50:12.230 --> 02:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
the industry is faced with the
 
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reinvent itself again
 
02:50:19.269 --> 02:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
all the way from australia across europe
 
02:50:21.030 --> 02:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
back to the uk i still have a lot of
 
02:50:23.190 --> 02:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues back in the uk each of the
 
02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
five large utilities in the uk are
 
02:50:30.230 --> 02:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
working on a separate facet to develop
 
02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:31.190 align:start position:0%
working on a separate facet to develop
clean

02:50:31.190 --> 02:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
clean
 
02:50:34.309 --> 02:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
hydrogen into its gas network
 
02:50:35.990 --> 02:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for them is
 
02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
decarbonization the opportunity for us
 
02:50:43.030 --> 02:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
is is energy independence
 
02:50:45.670 --> 02:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
with an additional advantage that it
 
02:50:48.710 --> 02:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
also supports the it also supports the
 
02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
the climate challenges that we've got so
 
02:50:52.469 --> 02:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
02:50:54.230 --> 02:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking at an opportunity right
 
02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
now to work with the mayor and the city
 
02:50:59.830 --> 02:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
of keene we have a propane air system
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
out there it's an isolated system
 
02:51:05.269 --> 02:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
serving about just over a thousand
 
02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
customers propane air is uh is is a
 
02:51:10.870 --> 02:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
commodity which isn't very often used
 
02:51:12.790 --> 02:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
there are no other systems like that in
 
02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
the entire united states and we're
 
02:51:18.710 --> 02:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the opportunity to how do we
 
02:51:21.269 --> 02:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
develop that particular part of the
 
02:51:24.790 --> 02:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
world so that so that one um it can be
 
02:51:26.389 --> 02:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
energy independent
 
02:51:30.230 --> 02:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
and and two it will also help um the the
 
02:51:31.590 --> 02:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
mayor out there
 
02:51:35.190 --> 02:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
achieve his uh his uh you know net zero
 
02:51:38.150 --> 02:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
climate change ambitions so
 
02:51:40.150 --> 02:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
hydrogen is is a reality there's lots of
 
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
different colored hydrogens um but i
 
02:51:42.640 --> 02:51:43.510 align:start position:0%
different colored hydrogens um but i
just

02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:51:44.389 --> 02:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:51:46.389 --> 02:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
to boil the ocean
 
02:51:49.349 --> 02:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
to boil the ocean it it it is
 
02:51:52.710 --> 02:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
probably the fastest moving technology
 
02:51:55.110 --> 02:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
in the gas industry today
 
02:51:56.389 --> 02:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of places where they're
 
02:51:58.830 --> 02:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
blending hydrogen into their existing
 
02:52:01.990 --> 02:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
systems um with a view to 100 hydrogen
 
02:52:04.870 --> 02:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
in the future so so the technology is a
 
02:52:04.880 --> 02:52:05.990 align:start position:0%
in the future so so the technology is a
reality

02:52:05.990 --> 02:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
reality
 
02:52:07.990 --> 02:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
the reality is it isn't it isn't here in
 
02:52:09.590 --> 02:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire just yet but it's
 
02:52:11.830 --> 02:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
extracting the hydrogen from water
 
02:52:14.790 --> 02:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
correct from water yeah using you and i
 
02:52:17.510 --> 02:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
i see renewable energy sources is a
 
02:52:19.750 --> 02:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
great source to do that because you need
 
02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:21.190 align:start position:0%
great source to do that because you need
electricity

02:52:21.190 --> 02:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:52:22.870 --> 02:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
to convert it from
 
02:52:24.630 --> 02:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's you do to
 
02:52:27.429 --> 02:52:27.439 align:start position:0%
separate the oxygen and hydrogen yeah
 
02:52:29.190 --> 02:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
but then you you have the hydrogen now
 
02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
is is the energy that that will be used
 
02:52:34.630 --> 02:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
not not necessarily that the actual
 
02:52:36.710 --> 02:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
solar energy but it is using solar
 
02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
energy to convert to
 
02:52:41.030 --> 02:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
the gas that's clean because there's no
 
02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
carbons in it no and
 
02:52:45.670 --> 02:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay well i like this idea
 
02:52:47.910 --> 02:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's all i want to say it's it's uh it
 
02:52:50.389 --> 02:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
excites me it's iced meat too it really
 
02:52:52.469 --> 02:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
does and it's a huge opportunity for us
 
02:52:56.150 --> 02:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
their names
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:07.429 --> 02:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
this is really an extension of
 
02:53:10.309 --> 02:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
what you just spoke of i i believe you
 
02:53:13.590 --> 02:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
also mentioned in your remarks uh uh
 
02:53:16.309 --> 02:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
projects a project that
 
02:53:18.870 --> 02:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
looks to enhance ex
 
02:53:21.590 --> 02:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
extend the use of batteries
 
02:53:23.750 --> 02:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe you could talk about that as
 
02:53:23.760 --> 02:53:24.790 align:start position:0%
and maybe you could talk about that as
well

02:53:24.790 --> 02:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:53:27.510 --> 02:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
sure so um so so we've got a pile of
 
02:53:28.950 --> 02:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing at the moment for about a
 
02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
hundred homes um our territory is uh
 
02:53:36.150 --> 02:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
lebanon and and salem it's about 100
 
02:53:39.349 --> 02:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
homes it's called a um a tesla powerwall
 
02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
so we supply a tesla powerwall to a
 
02:53:45.750 --> 02:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
residential customer they pay us a
 
02:53:48.389 --> 02:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
nominal monthly fee and throughout the
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
day energy prices electric prices vary
 
02:53:54.230 --> 02:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
what they're able to do in again boiling
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
the ocean is to um is to energize the
 
02:54:01.110 --> 02:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
battery at a time when uh the
 
02:54:04.389 --> 02:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
electricity prices are at their lowest
 
02:54:05.990 --> 02:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
and then when the energy prices are at
 
02:54:08.710 --> 02:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
their highest they can able to feed off
 
02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
the battery so it's really good for the
 
02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
customers and and
 
02:54:15.110 --> 02:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's also a good opportunity for us
 
02:54:16.950 --> 02:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
because i think once a year we're
 
02:54:18.710 --> 02:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to take
 
02:54:20.710 --> 02:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
um the power out of that battery and
 
02:54:22.630 --> 02:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
bring it into the system so it helps us
 
02:54:24.870 --> 02:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
to balance the network if we ever needed
 
02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:25.670 align:start position:0%
to balance the network if we ever needed
it

02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:54:28.230 --> 02:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
the other thing of course is um is you
 
02:54:29.910 --> 02:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
know we've had a
 
02:54:31.990 --> 02:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
pretty tough winter we've mobilized our
 
02:54:33.670 --> 02:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
incident command a few times getting
 
02:54:33.680 --> 02:54:34.469 align:start position:0%
incident command a few times getting
ready

02:54:34.469 --> 02:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
ready
 
02:54:36.950 --> 02:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
for potential high winds and everything
 
02:54:39.349 --> 02:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
else and in the event of an outage you
 
02:54:41.590 --> 02:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
can use the energy that is stored in
 
02:54:44.550 --> 02:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
that battery it's really a really great
 
02:54:46.550 --> 02:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
technology it's another thing i i get
 
02:54:48.230 --> 02:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
very excited about this industry by the
 
02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:48.950 align:start position:0%
very excited about this industry by the
way

02:54:48.950 --> 02:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:54:51.190 --> 02:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
i think you can probably tell
 
02:54:53.990 --> 02:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
well let me just uh comment that uh i
 
02:54:56.389 --> 02:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
would say amen to all that
 
02:54:59.030 --> 02:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
liberty is trying to do and this
 
02:55:01.349 --> 02:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
this focus on uh
 
02:55:01.359 --> 02:55:03.110 align:start position:0%
this focus on uh
on

02:55:03.110 --> 02:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:55:05.110 --> 02:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
energy conceived in a different way than
 
02:55:07.429 --> 02:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
it has been traditionally
 
02:55:09.510 --> 02:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:55:12.389 --> 02:55:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
and you elaborated with the hydrogen and
 
02:55:18.070 --> 02:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
with the battery storage but you you
 
02:55:20.790 --> 02:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
also mentioned geothermal yeah could you
 
02:55:24.070 --> 02:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
elaborate how you're involved with the g
 
02:55:27.030 --> 02:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so um so in my last role i was head
 
02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
of gas operations here for national grid
 
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
in new england
 
02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:32.070 align:start position:0%
in new england
and

02:55:32.070 --> 02:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
we're working with
 
02:55:35.830 --> 02:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
with an organization called heat
 
02:55:38.070 --> 02:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
and heat are environmentalists who are
 
02:55:39.990 --> 02:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
looking at repurposing the energy
 
02:55:41.269 --> 02:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
industry and look and looking at the
 
02:55:43.910 --> 02:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
future of energy and one of the causes
 
02:55:46.230 --> 02:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
that they champion is the opportunity to
 
02:55:49.429 --> 02:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
use geothermal heat and uh and actually
 
02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
there's a number of pilots now ongoing
 
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
um with heat and the um and the new
 
02:55:57.510 --> 02:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
england utilities and what it basically
 
02:56:00.309 --> 02:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
does is bring heat from within the earth
 
02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
distributes it through a um
 
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
through a pipe network so it's another
 
02:56:05.760 --> 02:56:06.550 align:start position:0%
through a pipe network so it's another
really

02:56:06.550 --> 02:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:56:08.710 --> 02:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
a great opportunity i haven't had the
 
02:56:11.590 --> 02:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk to anybody and and
 
02:56:13.830 --> 02:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
figure out what that might mean for us
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
but it's certainly something we should
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:21.910 --> 02:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
represent aaron

it's great technology it really does
 
02:57:42.309 --> 02:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
work it supports um it supports our

infrastructure it also
 
02:57:47.429 --> 02:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
helps us to balance that reliance on
 
02:57:49.030 --> 02:57:49.040 align:start position:0%

to help carry out that mission
 
04:03:34.389 --> 04:03:34.399 align:start position:0%

are observing in the housing market this

04:03:39.429 --> 04:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
background into what we're trying to do
 
04:03:40.630 --> 04:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
about the housing market in new
 
04:03:42.870 --> 04:03:42.880 align:start position:0%

04:03:47.670 --> 04:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
help make home ownership accessible and

and our assisted housing division helps

in addition to that
 
04:04:15.429 --> 04:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
we've been administering a range of
 
04:04:17.670 --> 04:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
emergency response programs on behalf of
 
04:04:18.710 --> 04:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
early in the pandemic we ran the shelter

act dollars which
 
04:04:26.469 --> 04:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
used about 12 million dollars to help
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
shelters across the state adapt their
 
04:04:32.830 --> 04:04:32.840 align:start position:0%

in

04:04:34.550 --> 04:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:04:36.469 --> 04:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
light of the pandemic and also to pay
 
04:04:36.479 --> 04:04:37.189 align:start position:0%
light of the pandemic and also to pay
for

04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:04:39.429 --> 04:04:39.439 align:start position:0%
ppe and things like that as they adapted
 
04:04:41.910 --> 04:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
for that first pandemic affected winter
 
04:04:43.189 --> 04:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
more recently we've been working in
 
04:04:45.269 --> 04:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
cooperation with the governor's office
 
04:04:47.349 --> 04:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
for emergency relief and recovery and
 
04:04:49.830 --> 04:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
the cap agencies on the emergency rental
 
04:04:51.429 --> 04:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
assistance program
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
and we're also the contractor
 
04:04:55.590 --> 04:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
for the state for the homeowner
 
04:04:57.030 --> 04:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
assistance fund
 
04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
which helps people who have fallen
 
04:05:00.550 --> 04:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
behind on their mortgage payments or
 
04:05:03.429 --> 04:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
property taxes during the pandemic and
 
04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
that will be launching soon
 
04:05:07.750 --> 04:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
all those programs are funded by
 
04:05:09.510 --> 04:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
federal grant programs including the
 
04:05:10.950 --> 04:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan and some related
 
04:05:13.510 --> 04:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
recent spending bills
 
04:05:13.520 --> 04:05:14.630 align:start position:0%
recent spending bills
so

04:05:14.630 --> 04:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:05:16.710 --> 04:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
those are important programs
 
04:05:19.110 --> 04:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
especially now as we've seen a number of
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
changes in the housing market in new
 
04:05:22.469 --> 04:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire over the last couple of years
 
04:05:23.590 --> 04:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire had a challenging
 
04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
environment before the pandemic and it's
 
04:05:28.070 --> 04:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
gotten a lot tougher and that's affected
 
04:05:29.590 --> 04:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
just about everybody who's looking for a
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
place to buy or rent where they want to
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
live it certainly has affected
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
low and middle income new hampshire
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
residents even more
 
04:05:39.910 --> 04:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
and that is who we primarily serve
 
04:05:41.269 --> 04:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
so we appreciate the opportunity to
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
speak with you today ben's going to go
 
04:05:45.429 --> 04:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
through some content that talks about
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
some of those changes some of them
 
04:05:48.870 --> 04:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
we understand the factors
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
that are driving them and some of them
 
04:05:51.830 --> 04:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
are just beginning to get our arms
 
04:05:52.950 --> 04:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
around but
 
04:05:54.389 --> 04:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
after he speaks we'll wrap it up and be
 
04:05:57.030 --> 04:05:57.040 align:start position:0%

i've done that
 
04:06:04.399 --> 04:06:05.590 align:start position:0%
i've done that
um

04:06:05.590 --> 04:06:05.600 align:start position:0%

uh in in this different room for from
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
what we normally meet but uh happy to
 
04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
see your faces and i i think we have
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
some members online as well
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to start talking about the
 
04:06:22.469 --> 04:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
housing market and i've done a number of
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
these these presentations uh before and
 
04:06:27.910 --> 04:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
the question i i usually have as a
 
04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
headline is
 
04:06:31.990 --> 04:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
what's happening with the housing market
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh certainly that's a really good
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
question because
 
04:06:38.070 --> 04:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh some unexpected things happened
 
04:06:38.080 --> 04:06:38.950 align:start position:0%
uh some unexpected things happened
during

04:06:38.950 --> 04:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
during
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
the covet emergency
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
certainly caught a lot of people by
 
04:06:42.640 --> 04:06:44.389 align:start position:0%
certainly caught a lot of people by
surprise

04:06:44.389 --> 04:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
surprise
 
04:06:46.469 --> 04:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
things seem to be returning to something
 
04:06:49.110 --> 04:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit more normal now
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
but it is it is indeed a new normal
 
04:06:53.670 --> 04:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
where we have very high prices both in
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
the rental and the purchase market i'm
 
04:06:57.750 --> 04:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
going to start talking about the the
 
04:07:00.389 --> 04:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
residential rental market trends
 
04:07:02.550 --> 04:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
and note that all of these slides and
 
04:07:04.630 --> 04:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
i'll and you have those of you have the
 
04:07:08.710 --> 04:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
paper copies i'm on slide four
 
04:07:10.790 --> 04:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
all of the data we have here presented
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
to you regarding the rental market is
 
04:07:15.670 --> 04:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
based upon our annual residential rental
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
cost survey so these are 2021 data
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
we are in the midst of our 2022
 
04:07:24.790 --> 04:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
residential rental cost survey so
 
04:07:27.510 --> 04:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're we annually survey something on
 
04:07:31.349 --> 04:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
the order of 20 to 25 000 units
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
04:07:33.830 --> 04:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
and then we
 
04:07:35.990 --> 04:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
pair it down to get a a controllable
 
04:07:37.189 --> 04:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
size of
 
04:07:39.510 --> 04:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
roughly 12 000 units
 
04:07:41.189 --> 04:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
and this is responses we get from the
 
04:07:43.110 --> 04:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
landlords on what they're charging
 
04:07:44.309 --> 04:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
tenants and what their tenants are
 
04:07:46.229 --> 04:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
paying in utilities and we control for
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
utilities so so we were able to discern
 
04:07:50.710 --> 04:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
the difference between situations where
 
04:07:52.070 --> 04:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
tenants are paying the utilities or
 
04:07:54.870 --> 04:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
where the landlord is paying utilities
 
04:07:56.309 --> 04:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
so we're in the midst of doing that and
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
we should have the 2022 numbers
 
04:08:00.389 --> 04:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
available publicly
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
probably in early july so this is a long
 
04:08:03.520 --> 04:08:04.790 align:start position:0%
probably in early july so this is a long
survey

04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
survey
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
and very very comprehensive and we work
 
04:08:10.070 --> 04:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
with the unh survey center and others to
 
04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
develop the data for us
 
04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
and we've been doing this survey since
 
04:08:17.910 --> 04:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
the early 90s and in our view it's it's
 
04:08:19.429 --> 04:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
the best source of information on the
 
04:08:21.990 --> 04:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
rental market in the state and is i
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
think peerless
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
among among all states in the country in
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
the quality of the data
 
04:08:31.110 --> 04:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
but looking at um the the costs and this
 
04:08:33.830 --> 04:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
is really what everyone's talking about
 
04:08:37.269 --> 04:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
the rental costs are high if you look at
 
04:08:39.030 --> 04:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
slide 4 you see
 
04:08:42.150 --> 04:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
the the median gross rent that's rent
 
04:08:43.830 --> 04:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
plus utilities
 
04:08:45.670 --> 04:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
statewide is almost fifteen hundred
 
04:08:47.110 --> 04:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
dollars that was last year it'll be
 
04:08:49.269 --> 04:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
certainly be higher this year
 
04:08:50.550 --> 04:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
04:08:51.910 --> 04:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
04:08:53.750 --> 04:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
all units that's for two bedroom units
 
04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
for all units it's uh thirteen hundred
 
04:08:57.189 --> 04:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
seventy three so
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
um recognizing that the bulk the vast
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
bulk of units statewide are two-bedroom
 
04:09:04.870 --> 04:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
units that's really a particularly
 
04:09:07.030 --> 04:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
important factor for us to look at then
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the the trends over time
 
04:09:11.110 --> 04:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
we see
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
significant changes between 2020 and
 
04:09:13.680 --> 04:09:15.189 align:start position:0%
significant changes between 2020 and
2021

04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
2021
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
and also in five years roughly you know
 
04:09:20.229 --> 04:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
20 to 25 percent increases over five
 
04:09:20.239 --> 04:09:21.910 align:start position:0%
20 to 25 percent increases over five
years

04:09:21.910 --> 04:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
and we recognize too that
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
as these prices have gone up for renters
 
04:09:30.150 --> 04:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
their incomes have not kept pace
 
04:09:32.950 --> 04:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
so say 20 to 25 percent increases in
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
rents and roughly over that same period
 
04:09:37.590 --> 04:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
of time a six percent
 
04:09:40.229 --> 04:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
increase in median renter income
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's getting tougher and tougher for
 
04:09:44.790 --> 04:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
renters to afford regardless of their
 
04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
incomes and regardless of where they are
 
04:09:48.950 --> 04:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
moving on to uh slide five this is the
 
04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh this is kind of the flip side of what
 
04:09:56.469 --> 04:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
we look at in terms of of the the rental
 
04:09:58.710 --> 04:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
market the vacancy rate uh what's
 
04:10:01.269 --> 04:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
available for people who are looking for
 
04:10:04.389 --> 04:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
a place and this is a story that we read
 
04:10:06.070 --> 04:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
almost every day in the headlines and
 
04:10:08.229 --> 04:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
newspapers um
 
04:10:08.239 --> 04:10:09.110 align:start position:0%
newspapers um
that

04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:11.349 --> 04:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
it's hard to find a place to rent
 
04:10:13.030 --> 04:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of your income because
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
there's just not much out there
 
04:10:17.349 --> 04:10:17.359 align:start position:0%
all over the state
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
so vacancy rate of residential rental
 
04:10:21.670 --> 04:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
units uh all of
 
04:10:23.990 --> 04:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
for all units is below one percent point
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
nine for two bedroom units uh is point
 
04:10:29.990 --> 04:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
six percent that that's stunningly low
 
04:10:30.000 --> 04:10:30.870 align:start position:0%
six percent that that's stunningly low
uh

04:10:30.870 --> 04:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:32.229 --> 04:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
and you and you're looking looking at
 
04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
the graph you can see
 
04:10:36.389 --> 04:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh there's variation from year to year
 
04:10:38.150 --> 04:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
but if we were to draw a trend line you
 
04:10:40.469 --> 04:10:40.479 align:start position:0%
can see it trending downward
 
04:10:43.110 --> 04:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
and that is not a good sign for the the
 
04:10:45.030 --> 04:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
rental market it's not good sign for
 
04:10:45.040 --> 04:10:46.469 align:start position:0%
rental market it's not good sign for
renters

04:10:46.469 --> 04:10:46.479 align:start position:0%
renters
 
04:10:49.030 --> 04:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
if you happen to be a landlord great
 
04:10:51.030 --> 04:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
good for you because you've got your
 
04:10:54.150 --> 04:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
choice of of who you can rent to uh and
 
04:10:56.150 --> 04:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know certainly for for anyone who
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
has attempted to rent uh in this market
 
04:11:01.030 --> 04:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh it is difficult but from from a
 
04:11:03.030 --> 04:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
landlord's perspective it's really great
 
04:11:05.269 --> 04:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
um i just anecdotally
 
04:11:07.110 --> 04:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
my wife's daughter was looking for a
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
place to live outside of portland maine
 
04:11:10.950 --> 04:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
very similar housing market to what
 
04:11:13.030 --> 04:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
we're experiencing here in new hampshire
 
04:11:13.040 --> 04:11:13.990 align:start position:0%
we're experiencing here in new hampshire
and

04:11:13.990 --> 04:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:17.349 --> 04:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
she could not find a place to rent in
 
04:11:19.510 --> 04:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
the greater portland area something that
 
04:11:23.429 --> 04:11:23.439 align:start position:0%
she could reasonably afford um and so we
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
we ultimately helped her buy a house it
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
was actually easier to buy a small house
 
04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
for her than to find a place to rent
 
04:11:30.960 --> 04:11:31.830 align:start position:0%
for her than to find a place to rent
which

04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:11:33.990 --> 04:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
is difficult do you mind if we interrupt
 
04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
questions or do you want to please do
 
04:11:37.830 --> 04:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative brandi thank you
 
04:11:39.349 --> 04:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you both
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh back to slide four when you said you
 
04:11:43.830 --> 04:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
said i'm gonna make sure i understood
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
what you said
 
04:11:47.670 --> 04:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
these are the rents including utilities
 
04:11:50.229 --> 04:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
yes and those would be heat and well
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
electricity and heat yes okay thank you
 
04:11:55.110 --> 04:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
and then on the one year the page you're
 
04:11:56.150 --> 04:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
on right now
 
04:11:57.349 --> 04:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
page five
 
04:11:58.560 --> 04:11:59.510 align:start position:0%
page five
so

04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:01.510 --> 04:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
that decline is is unique is new
 
04:12:03.429 --> 04:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire unique in this or is this the
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
trend you're seeing around the country
 
04:12:06.790 --> 04:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
as well this is a trend around the
 
04:12:09.429 --> 04:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
country generally speaking uh i'd say
 
04:12:12.150 --> 04:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's particularly acute in
 
04:12:14.070 --> 04:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
some markets so the
 
04:12:14.080 --> 04:12:15.189 align:start position:0%
some markets so the
boston

04:12:15.189 --> 04:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
boston
 
04:12:17.590 --> 04:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
met greater metro area
 
04:12:19.429 --> 04:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
which includes southern new hampshire
 
04:12:21.750 --> 04:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
but extending throughout new hampshire
 
04:12:24.070 --> 04:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
into southern maine and you see it in
 
04:12:24.080 --> 04:12:25.189 align:start position:0%
into southern maine and you see it in
other

04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:12:26.870 --> 04:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
other markets that are influenced by
 
04:12:29.590 --> 04:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
larger urban areas certainly we hear a
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
lot about san francisco uh which is you
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
know san francisco and boston compete
 
04:12:36.550 --> 04:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
for the the toughest housing market in
 
04:12:38.790 --> 04:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
the country um so this this is a
 
04:12:41.429 --> 04:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
national issue and nationally we do see
 
04:12:43.269 --> 04:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
that there's a dearth of housing
 
04:12:43.279 --> 04:12:44.710 align:start position:0%
that there's a dearth of housing
available

04:12:44.710 --> 04:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:12:44.720 --> 04:12:45.510 align:start position:0%
available
in

04:12:45.510 --> 04:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:12:48.309 --> 04:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
important markets for people to rent or
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
to buy
 
04:12:51.269 --> 04:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:12:53.349 --> 04:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative janisian
 
04:12:54.950 --> 04:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:12:56.550 --> 04:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming and presenting
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
this to us today um what is what would
 
04:13:02.149 --> 04:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
you consider a normal vacancy rate
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question and uh we
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
can skip ahead to slide seven oh and
 
04:13:09.910 --> 04:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
i'll do that just for these purposes and
 
04:13:11.429 --> 04:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
and jennifer thank you for advancing
 
04:13:14.149 --> 04:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
that looking at the vacancy rate by
 
04:13:14.159 --> 04:13:15.349 align:start position:0%
that looking at the vacancy rate by
county

04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
county
 
04:13:15.359 --> 04:13:16.790 align:start position:0%
county
um

04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:18.710 --> 04:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
you can see what we generally consider
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
to be a balanced renter rental market
 
04:13:23.349 --> 04:13:23.359 align:start position:0%
that is balancing the interests of uh
 
04:13:25.510 --> 04:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
tenants and of landlords to be something
 
04:13:27.429 --> 04:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
on the order of five percent
 
04:13:30.070 --> 04:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
um three percent we generally regard as
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
turnover rate that is the time it takes
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
for a landlord to prep a unit between
 
04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
tenants uh and we have been below three
 
04:13:36.960 --> 04:13:37.910 align:start position:0%
tenants uh and we have been below three
percent

04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:13:37.920 --> 04:13:38.710 align:start position:0%
percent
for

04:13:38.710 --> 04:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:13:41.670 --> 04:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
seven or eight years a long time and if
 
04:13:44.469 --> 04:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
you look at it county by county
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's pretty uh uniform throughout the
 
04:13:49.189 --> 04:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
state even in
 
04:13:51.110 --> 04:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
counties where you consider incomes to
 
04:13:52.389 --> 04:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
be lower
 
04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
kawasa county uh in particular you see
 
04:13:57.990 --> 04:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
that the vacancy rate is extremely low
 
04:13:59.670 --> 04:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's
 
04:14:01.110 --> 04:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
there's just not enough out there for
 
04:14:01.120 --> 04:14:02.149 align:start position:0%
there's just not enough out there for
folks

04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
folks
 
04:14:05.110 --> 04:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh now if we can move back to slide six
 
04:14:07.990 --> 04:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that was a great question thank you
 
04:14:08.000 --> 04:14:08.950 align:start position:0%
and that was a great question thank you
uh

04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
just looking at the the the rents county
 
04:14:13.349 --> 04:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
to county
 
04:14:13.359 --> 04:14:15.349 align:start position:0%
to county
um

04:14:15.349 --> 04:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
you we know that you know the
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
southeastern portion of the state the
 
04:14:20.469 --> 04:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
southern tier of the state is really
 
04:14:23.189 --> 04:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
that where the the hot market is it's
 
04:14:25.830 --> 04:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
also where most people live uh the four
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
counties merrimack hillsborough
 
04:14:29.189 --> 04:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
stratford and and rockingham county
 
04:14:31.510 --> 04:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
constitute about 75 percent of the the
 
04:14:33.030 --> 04:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
state's population
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
and that's really where we see that the
 
04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
hottest rental market rockingham county
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
has the highest median at uh 1672 that's
 
04:14:43.830 --> 04:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
again last year's figures
 
04:14:46.630 --> 04:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
and the changes over time are pretty
 
04:14:48.630 --> 04:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
significant so
 
04:14:50.229 --> 04:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
you know rockingham county over a
 
04:14:53.110 --> 04:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
five-year period from 2016 to 2021 the
 
04:14:55.030 --> 04:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
rent went up 26
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
um even in koas county it went up 11
 
04:15:00.070 --> 04:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
over that five-year period and depending
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
upon how you look at it um
 
04:15:05.189 --> 04:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
you might say well there's you know a
 
04:15:05.199 --> 04:15:06.550 align:start position:0%
you might say well there's you know a
um

04:15:06.550 --> 04:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:09.670 --> 04:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
say uh more units may be more affordable
 
04:15:11.830 --> 04:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
in coast county but you're not going to
 
04:15:14.950 --> 04:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
be commuting uh from uh say berlin uh
 
04:15:16.870 --> 04:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
well not too many people would from from
 
04:15:19.830 --> 04:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
berlin uh down to a job in in you know
 
04:15:21.510 --> 04:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
the portsmouth area to manchester or
 
04:15:23.110 --> 04:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
concord that's a pretty long drive some
 
04:15:24.950 --> 04:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
people some people in this room may
 
04:15:27.910 --> 04:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
actually make that commute i don't know
 
04:15:29.990 --> 04:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
but most people would not be willing to
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:15:34.710 --> 04:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
so even though the the rents are lower
 
04:15:36.389 --> 04:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
in cost county
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
relative to the incomes of the people
 
04:15:40.149 --> 04:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
who live there it's also a pretty
 
04:15:42.870 --> 04:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
unaffordable place
 
04:15:44.550 --> 04:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
so let's move to
 
04:15:44.560 --> 04:15:46.149 align:start position:0%
so let's move to
um

04:15:46.149 --> 04:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:47.990 --> 04:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
the last slide on the renter market
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's slide eight and this gets to that
 
04:15:51.910 --> 04:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
the point i was just making about the
 
04:15:55.030 --> 04:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
relative affordability county to county
 
04:15:57.030 --> 04:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
so you can see in kawasa county and
 
04:15:59.830 --> 04:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
cheshire county the rents are somewhat
 
04:16:01.750 --> 04:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
more affordable
 
04:16:04.389 --> 04:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
to people making the median renter
 
04:16:04.399 --> 04:16:05.830 align:start position:0%
to people making the median renter
income

04:16:05.830 --> 04:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
income
 
04:16:08.229 --> 04:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
for that county but still
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
the median is the the halfway mark of
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
the population so
 
04:16:15.990 --> 04:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
in in even in cowas county you've got 23
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
percent of the units that are affordable
 
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
for 50 of the population
 
04:16:24.389 --> 04:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
that's renting
 
04:16:27.189 --> 04:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
it is an unaffordable market even there
 
04:16:30.550 --> 04:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
statewide 13 only 13
 
04:16:33.110 --> 04:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
of the units in the renter market
 
04:16:34.389 --> 04:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:16:36.309 --> 04:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
whether they're occupied by by tenants
 
04:16:39.030 --> 04:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
now or on the market 13 are affordable
 
04:16:40.830 --> 04:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
to the the median renter market
 
04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
statewide that it is a really tough
 
04:16:47.510 --> 04:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:49.349 --> 04:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
now unless there any
 
04:16:50.950 --> 04:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
more questions on the renter market we
 
04:16:52.630 --> 04:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
can move on to the
 
04:16:54.790 --> 04:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
the purchase market
 
04:16:58.389 --> 04:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
and look at home ownership activity
 
04:17:01.910 --> 04:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
so we're on slide 10 now
 
04:17:01.920 --> 04:17:03.269 align:start position:0%
so we're on slide 10 now
and

04:17:03.269 --> 04:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:05.750 --> 04:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
again this this
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
graph shows uh pretty stark numbers um
 
04:17:11.040 --> 04:17:11.990 align:start position:0%
graph shows uh pretty stark numbers um
from

04:17:11.990 --> 04:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:17:14.229 --> 04:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
for a number of uh times that we were
 
04:17:15.670 --> 04:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
doing these this presentation we were
 
04:17:18.309 --> 04:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
looking at you know annual changes and i
 
04:17:18.319 --> 04:17:19.429 align:start position:0%
looking at you know annual changes and i
thought

04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
thought
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
well maybe we should be looking at a
 
04:17:25.510 --> 04:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
two-year change look to pre-covet and to
 
04:17:25.520 --> 04:17:26.550 align:start position:0%
two-year change look to pre-covet and to
current

04:17:26.550 --> 04:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
information so january 2020
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
the median sales price statewide was 280
 
04:17:34.560 --> 04:17:36.309 align:start position:0%
the median sales price statewide was 280
000

04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
000
 
04:17:38.790 --> 04:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
january of 2022
 
04:17:41.269 --> 04:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
385 000
 
04:17:45.910 --> 04:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's a 38 increase over two years
 
04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's pretty shocking and you know
 
04:17:50.950 --> 04:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
incomes have not kept pace it's tough to
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
find a place that is affordable to buy
 
04:17:55.990 --> 04:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
not just to rent but to buy as well and
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
you can see this this curve
 
04:18:00.229 --> 04:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh really accelerating with the
 
04:18:02.149 --> 04:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
beginning of the pandemic and this was
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
at the outside i talked about what's
 
04:18:05.110 --> 04:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
happening with the housing market that's
 
04:18:07.110 --> 04:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
that question this is what caught us by
 
04:18:07.120 --> 04:18:08.550 align:start position:0%
that question this is what caught us by
surprise

04:18:08.550 --> 04:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
surprise
 
04:18:10.389 --> 04:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
yeah how much of this
 
04:18:15.349 --> 04:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
38 percent was associated with the
 
04:18:15.359 --> 04:18:16.630 align:start position:0%
38 percent was associated with the
pandemic

04:18:16.630 --> 04:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:18:17.910 --> 04:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
with people
 
04:18:21.110 --> 04:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
from like the boston new york they're
 
04:18:24.389 --> 04:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
coming into new hampshire buying up
 
04:18:26.309 --> 04:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question you know
 
04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll say
 
04:18:30.149 --> 04:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
we have another slide coming up that
 
04:18:32.469 --> 04:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
addresses where people are coming from
 
04:18:34.469 --> 04:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't answer that question
 
04:18:34.479 --> 04:18:35.429 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't answer that question
fully

04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
fully
 
04:18:38.309 --> 04:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh and this is a question that we are
 
04:18:40.550 --> 04:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
puzzling over ourselves
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people are and we'll be
 
04:18:45.910 --> 04:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
attempting to answer it for some time to
 
04:18:48.469 --> 04:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
come as we as the data get better and as
 
04:18:49.990 --> 04:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
we look have a better historical
 
04:18:52.389 --> 04:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
perspective representative aaron thank
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
you mr chair and as a follow-up to what
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying i mean i know in sullivan
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
county uh i've spoken to the the
 
04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
registrar of deeds
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
and she said you know
 
04:19:05.189 --> 04:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
real estate has just been snapped up
 
04:19:07.830 --> 04:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh sight unseen by people from out of
 
04:19:07.840 --> 04:19:09.269 align:start position:0%
uh sight unseen by people from out of
state

04:19:09.269 --> 04:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:19:11.429 --> 04:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
they will call her and or call real
 
04:19:12.870 --> 04:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
estate agents and say you know do you
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
have a property that has x y z
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
and sight unseen by it
 
04:19:19.590 --> 04:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
at prices that
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
we've never seen in our county
 
04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
so i think that's really starting to
 
04:19:27.510 --> 04:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
make you know the raise in in these uh
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
prices of these homes and properties i
 
04:19:29.680 --> 04:19:30.790 align:start position:0%
prices of these homes and properties i
think

04:19:30.790 --> 04:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
i i agree with you completely and uh it
 
04:19:36.469 --> 04:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
and we've heard lots of stories we um
 
04:19:38.550 --> 04:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
because we do home ownership lending too
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
and so we hear stories about uh from our
 
04:19:44.790 --> 04:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
the lenders and the realtors uh that
 
04:19:46.149 --> 04:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
people are buying things without
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
contingencies they're waiving the home
 
04:19:51.590 --> 04:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
inspections they're buying cash and if
 
04:19:54.309 --> 04:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
you're if you're a first-time home buyer
 
04:19:56.149 --> 04:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
if you're you've got you know lots of
 
04:19:57.830 --> 04:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
student loans and you don't have a
 
04:20:00.469 --> 04:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
really big down payment
 
04:20:03.510 --> 04:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
if if you're seeking mortgage approval
 
04:20:05.830 --> 04:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
and you're face to face
 
04:20:08.469 --> 04:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
competing with a cash buyer the seller
 
04:20:10.149 --> 04:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
is going to want to take that cash buyer
 
04:20:13.830 --> 04:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
yeah mr chair follow-up yeah and you
 
04:20:14.790 --> 04:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
know one of the things they're
 
04:20:16.229 --> 04:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
mentioning is that the folks who are
 
04:20:18.550 --> 04:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
coming from out of state
 
04:20:20.950 --> 04:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
these prices that they're paying here
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
are still so affordable and cheap
 
04:20:26.710 --> 04:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
in comparison to what they're selling in
 
04:20:28.070 --> 04:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
their uh
 
04:20:30.309 --> 04:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
states they're coming from yes so
 
04:20:30.319 --> 04:20:31.510 align:start position:0%
states they're coming from yes so
particularly

04:20:31.510 --> 04:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
04:20:35.110 --> 04:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
the boston uh uh you know close to metro
 
04:20:37.590 --> 04:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
area uh if you're looking at properties
 
04:20:40.469 --> 04:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
in in in brooklyn or waltham
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
um they're they're twice the cost of
 
04:20:44.630 --> 04:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
what you could uh purchase in new
 
04:20:46.389 --> 04:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire and maybe get twice the home
 
04:20:48.710 --> 04:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:20:51.269 --> 04:20:51.279 align:start position:0%
so it is a it's a
 
04:20:53.510 --> 04:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's a tough market it's a great if
 
04:20:55.110 --> 04:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
you're a seller
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
as long as you have a place to move to
 
04:21:02.070 --> 04:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
are you going to be able to see
 
04:21:13.030 --> 04:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
how much our renter to homebuyer home
 
04:21:13.040 --> 04:21:14.070 align:start position:0%
how much our renter to homebuyer home
owner

04:21:14.070 --> 04:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
owner
 
04:21:14.080 --> 04:21:15.110 align:start position:0%
owner
on

04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
ratio has changed
 
04:21:20.070 --> 04:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
with all of this buying
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
because there's persistent rumors at
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
least of based on things like that
 
04:21:30.229 --> 04:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
that people are buying just in order
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
to hold rent for high prices and flip
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
and not planning on moving here
 
04:21:39.110 --> 04:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
that that's a great question
 
04:21:41.429 --> 04:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
yes we will be able to do that but it
 
04:21:43.189 --> 04:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
will take some time for us to be able to
 
04:21:46.309 --> 04:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
develop the data and and i think
 
04:21:49.510 --> 04:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to people
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
speculatively purchasing in anticipation
 
04:21:54.309 --> 04:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
of flipping the the properties for
 
04:21:54.319 --> 04:21:55.590 align:start position:0%
of flipping the the properties for
profit

04:21:55.590 --> 04:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
profit
 
04:21:57.269 --> 04:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
which you know it
 
04:21:59.429 --> 04:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
this is the way the market operates
 
04:22:01.510 --> 04:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
there are also those people
 
04:22:01.520 --> 04:22:02.309 align:start position:0%
there are also those people
or

04:22:02.309 --> 04:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:22:05.030 --> 04:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
more institutional investors
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
who will purchase properties with the
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
intention of holding them for the long
 
04:22:11.349 --> 04:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
run and renting them
 
04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
so there is an increasing market
 
04:22:15.030 --> 04:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
nationally and i think
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
eventually it will come here to new
 
04:22:18.309 --> 04:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire as well we haven't seen it
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
that much but nationally where we have
 
04:22:21.359 --> 04:22:23.510 align:start position:0%
that much but nationally where we have
larger

04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
larger
 
04:22:25.510 --> 04:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
institutional investors purchasing
 
04:22:27.030 --> 04:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
properties for the purpose of holding
 
04:22:29.189 --> 04:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
them and renting them out and there so
 
04:22:31.349 --> 04:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
there is an increasing market for the
 
04:22:33.830 --> 04:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
rental of freestanding single-family
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:42.070 --> 04:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.550 --> 04:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
if you look at the very tail the right
 
04:22:47.349 --> 04:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
tail of this this curve the blue line
 
04:22:49.750 --> 04:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
you can see how it has smoothed out a
 
04:22:52.309 --> 04:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
bit uh it and and
 
04:22:54.070 --> 04:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
at the outset when when i started
 
04:22:55.750 --> 04:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
talking i talked about the
 
04:22:58.070 --> 04:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
returning to some sort of new normal we
 
04:23:01.110 --> 04:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
have seen home prices not coming down
 
04:23:03.110 --> 04:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
but stabilizing a bit in the last couple
 
04:23:05.110 --> 04:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
of months which suggests that we are
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
returning to something
 
04:23:07.199 --> 04:23:08.229 align:start position:0%
returning to something
more

04:23:08.229 --> 04:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:23:11.189 --> 04:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
normal in terms of seasonal activity
 
04:23:13.750 --> 04:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
typically speaking we see
 
04:23:16.149 --> 04:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
home sales activity falling off in
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
november december january february and
 
04:23:19.830 --> 04:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
then picking up for the spring market
 
04:23:21.429 --> 04:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
that did not happen
 
04:23:23.750 --> 04:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
in in 2020
 
04:23:26.550 --> 04:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
winter 2020 into 2021 in fact that was a
 
04:23:28.710 --> 04:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
really hot season
 
04:23:30.950 --> 04:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
but coming into this winter season we've
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
seen it slowing down a bit which may be
 
04:23:35.670 --> 04:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
attributable to the lack of inventory
 
04:23:37.590 --> 04:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
which we'll talk about in a moment
 
04:23:40.149 --> 04:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
may be attributable to increasing
 
04:23:42.070 --> 04:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
interest rates as well uh putting a
 
04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
something of a damper on the market we
 
04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate prices coming down
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
um but they have stabilized a little bit
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
into something more of a seasonal
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
activity that we we typically see in the
 
04:23:54.389 --> 04:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
blue line you can see that the seasonal
 
04:23:56.950 --> 04:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in prices and we seem to be
 
04:23:59.590 --> 04:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
coming into that now
 
04:24:01.349 --> 04:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
moving on to
 
04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
slide 11 this is the flip side of this
 
04:24:07.349 --> 04:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
story supply and demand
 
04:24:07.359 --> 04:24:08.710 align:start position:0%
story supply and demand
the

04:24:08.710 --> 04:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:10.870 --> 04:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
the inventory of housing that is
 
04:24:13.110 --> 04:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
available on the market and this is this
 
04:24:15.670 --> 04:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh these these curves the blue line and
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
the orange dotted line or dashed line
 
04:24:21.750 --> 04:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
indicate how long it would take for
 
04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
everything that's currently on the
 
04:24:23.359 --> 04:24:24.389 align:start position:0%
everything that's currently on the
market

04:24:24.389 --> 04:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
market
 
04:24:27.590 --> 04:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
to sell at the preceding 12 months pace
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
of sales activity so it's an indication
 
04:24:32.950 --> 04:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
of of the capacity of the market to meet
 
04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
current demand
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
and we generally regard something on the
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
a six month sub inventory to be a
 
04:24:42.229 --> 04:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
balanced market like in the the renter
 
04:24:45.110 --> 04:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
market this is a market six percent or
 
04:24:47.269 --> 04:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
six months inventory balances the
 
04:24:49.349 --> 04:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
interests of buyers and sellers
 
04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
approximately it's not a it's not a hard
 
04:24:52.870 --> 04:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
science to it but it's an approximate
 
04:24:55.510 --> 04:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
number we've been we've been below six
 
04:24:58.469 --> 04:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
months of inventory since 2016 or before
 
04:24:58.479 --> 04:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
months of inventory since 2016 or before
that

04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:25:02.389 --> 04:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
um and we are now down below one month
 
04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
in inventory and if you look at the data
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
that's available from the new hampshire
 
04:25:08.309 --> 04:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
association of realtors as well you see
 
04:25:11.429 --> 04:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
time on market time on market of things
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
coming onto the market is now
 
04:25:15.269 --> 04:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
under a month which is
 
04:25:18.309 --> 04:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
it's just it's shocking how hot this
 
04:25:20.950 --> 04:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
market is it's not quite as hot as it
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
was maybe six months ago or a year ago
 
04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's not red red red hot or white hot
 
04:25:31.110 --> 04:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's just hot it's still hot market
 
04:25:31.120 --> 04:25:31.910 align:start position:0%
it's just hot it's still hot market
and

04:25:31.910 --> 04:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:34.630 --> 04:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
recognized too that with these this this
 
04:25:36.870 --> 04:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
balance between supply and demand we saw
 
04:25:38.469 --> 04:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
that on the preceding slide with with
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
the prices uh this really impacts those
 
04:25:43.590 --> 04:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
people who are attempting to enter home
 
04:25:45.189 --> 04:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
ownership mr chairman
 
04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative brown you know another
 
04:25:49.189 --> 04:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
question thanks um
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
so the blue line oscillation is that
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
seasonal is that the seasonal aspect
 
04:25:57.349 --> 04:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:59.910 --> 04:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
now moving on to um
 
04:26:01.269 --> 04:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
slide 12.
 
04:26:03.510 --> 04:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
this is the the actual sales activity
 
04:26:05.830 --> 04:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
the the numbers of properties
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
residential properties
 
04:26:07.680 --> 04:26:09.269 align:start position:0%
residential properties
sold

04:26:09.269 --> 04:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
sold
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
and these are
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
for the past three years now moving
 
04:26:15.110 --> 04:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
january to the past four years
 
04:26:17.510 --> 04:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
we see that the
 
04:26:20.710 --> 04:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
tempering of activity in january this of
 
04:26:23.349 --> 04:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
january 2022 in comparison to january
 
04:26:23.359 --> 04:26:24.950 align:start position:0%
january 2022 in comparison to january
2021

04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
2021
 
04:26:28.710 --> 04:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
despite the very low inventory um we
 
04:26:31.670 --> 04:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
we're seeing uh an extraordinary pace of
 
04:26:34.309 --> 04:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
sales which suggests increasing prices
 
04:26:36.870 --> 04:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
but also that time on market coming down
 
04:26:39.750 --> 04:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
so things were selling very fast um it
 
04:26:41.830 --> 04:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
seems to have reached a point where the
 
04:26:44.790 --> 04:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
market just can't accommodate the need
 
04:26:46.950 --> 04:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
for those additional sales and so in
 
04:26:49.189 --> 04:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
fact we're seeing fewer and fewer sales
 
04:26:51.030 --> 04:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
because there's just not enough out
 
04:26:53.189 --> 04:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
there for people to buy and this is the
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
story we've been hearing for a number of
 
04:26:58.149 --> 04:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
months maybe the last year and a half
 
04:27:00.309 --> 04:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
from realtors there's just not enough
 
04:27:02.710 --> 04:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
inventory for them uh to sell to their
 
04:27:04.149 --> 04:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
their customers their their clients
 
04:27:05.750 --> 04:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're the people who want to buy a
 
04:27:05.760 --> 04:27:07.990 align:start position:0%
they're the people who want to buy a
home

04:27:07.990 --> 04:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:27:10.149 --> 04:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
and so while if you look at the the
 
04:27:12.469 --> 04:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
december activity the middle bar in
 
04:27:15.510 --> 04:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
december uh that is 2021
 
04:27:17.750 --> 04:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
and and that's that that high level of
 
04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
activity that i was talking about the
 
04:27:19.439 --> 04:27:20.950 align:start position:0%
activity that i was talking about the
unusually

04:27:20.950 --> 04:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
unusually
 
04:27:23.590 --> 04:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
high winter activity it seems to have
 
04:27:27.110 --> 04:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
come down now in in 2022 in this this
 
04:27:27.120 --> 04:27:31.030 align:start position:0%
come down now in in 2022 in this this
season

04:27:31.030 --> 04:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
next slide is slide 13 and this is
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
really a
 
04:27:36.870 --> 04:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
big part of the story
 
04:27:39.510 --> 04:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh in the sales market the mortgage
 
04:27:40.950 --> 04:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
interest rates
 
04:27:42.950 --> 04:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
and you see over time this goes back to
 
04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
2000 uh how far down the interest rates
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
have come
 
04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
and we have circled uh december 2020
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
in its circle for a reason at two point
 
04:27:55.030 --> 04:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
six eight percent
 
04:27:58.229 --> 04:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh this was uh the lowest
 
04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh that interest rates nationally have
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
ever been recorded this is a freddie mac
 
04:28:05.030 --> 04:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
survey of uh
 
04:28:06.630 --> 04:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
national survey of
 
04:28:08.229 --> 04:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
major mortgage lenders and the interest
 
04:28:09.990 --> 04:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
rates they're charging and freddie mac
 
04:28:12.389 --> 04:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
has been doing this survey since 1972
 
04:28:14.710 --> 04:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
and this is uh the lowest they ever
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
recorded uh it has come up since then
 
04:28:20.229 --> 04:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
and there certainly is
 
04:28:21.910 --> 04:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
news from the fed that they're planning
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
to do additional interest rate increases
 
04:28:27.110 --> 04:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
um and so that that is part of the the
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
tempering activity that we see going on
 
04:28:30.870 --> 04:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
with with the market right now but
 
04:28:33.030 --> 04:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot of activity and
 
04:28:34.830 --> 04:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
especially as there's the
 
04:28:37.590 --> 04:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
threat or the perception of a threat of
 
04:28:39.030 --> 04:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
increased uh
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
interest rates will drive additional
 
04:28:42.630 --> 04:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
activity too people need to buy now
 
04:28:45.110 --> 04:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
before the interest rates go up and so
 
04:28:47.030 --> 04:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
as much as they can they're they're
 
04:28:49.670 --> 04:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
engaging in that activity so you see now
 
04:28:52.389 --> 04:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
we're up to uh 3.45 percent and that's
 
04:28:53.670 --> 04:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
the highest it's been since um
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh 2020. uh and then going back it's uh
 
04:29:07.269 --> 04:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
now looking at
 
04:29:10.630 --> 04:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly detailed slide i'm not
 
04:29:12.309 --> 04:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
going to go through all of this you can
 
04:29:13.510 --> 04:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
read it at your leisure if you have
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
questions later on please feel free to
 
04:29:16.870 --> 04:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
send them to us
 
04:29:18.790 --> 04:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
but this is
 
04:29:20.790 --> 04:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
looking at mortgage lending in new
 
04:29:23.110 --> 04:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire this is the mortgage bankers
 
04:29:25.030 --> 04:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
association data
 
04:29:28.389 --> 04:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
from december of 2021 note that
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
80 percent
 
04:29:33.110 --> 04:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
of all applications for mortgages in
 
04:29:36.149 --> 04:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
december of 2021 were for refinancing
 
04:29:38.229 --> 04:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
and that's that that threat that i
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
talked about the threat of increased
 
04:29:41.110 --> 04:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
interest rates
 
04:29:42.630 --> 04:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
you know you know honey we've got to act
 
04:29:45.189 --> 04:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
now we've got to re-fire our home we've
 
04:29:47.510 --> 04:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
got to get it down from 4.5 percent to
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
3.5 percent
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
and you know if you plan to stay in your
 
04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
home for a long time then that that's a
 
04:29:54.389 --> 04:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
good deal for you you can cover the cost
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
of closing and save over the long run
 
04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
that said if you compare and there's a
 
04:30:03.030 --> 04:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
typo on the slide it should read this is
 
04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the page december 2020
 
04:30:08.229 --> 04:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
to december 2021 not december 19 but
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
december 2020 to december 21 we see a
 
04:30:12.560 --> 04:30:13.670 align:start position:0%
december 2020 to december 21 we see a
drop

04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
drop
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
in the refi activity and a
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
slight increase in the purchase activity
 
04:30:18.720 --> 04:30:19.750 align:start position:0%
slight increase in the purchase activity
overall

04:30:19.750 --> 04:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
overall
 
04:30:21.750 --> 04:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
and that is i think
 
04:30:23.510 --> 04:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
an indication that
 
04:30:25.030 --> 04:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
much of the refi
 
04:30:27.429 --> 04:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
activity that we have seen has been
 
04:30:27.439 --> 04:30:28.950 align:start position:0%
activity that we have seen has been
exhausted

04:30:28.950 --> 04:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
exhausted
 
04:30:30.710 --> 04:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
that is those people who were going to
 
04:30:33.750 --> 04:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
refi have done it and so as the interest
 
04:30:35.590 --> 04:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
rates go up they're saying okay we've
 
04:30:37.269 --> 04:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
we've done what we can with our with our
 
04:30:39.670 --> 04:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
refi of our home uh we're not going to
 
04:30:42.309 --> 04:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:44.229 --> 04:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
and representative amy you asked about
 
04:30:44.239 --> 04:30:44.950 align:start position:0%
and representative amy you asked about
the

04:30:44.950 --> 04:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:30:47.110 --> 04:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
the flipping behavior
 
04:30:47.120 --> 04:30:47.910 align:start position:0%
the flipping behavior
and

04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
here's some information on this in the
 
04:30:51.750 --> 04:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
middle of this page investor purchase
 
04:30:53.910 --> 04:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
mortgage versus you know second home
 
04:30:55.830 --> 04:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
purchase mortgage
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
it's still relatively low in those
 
04:31:00.790 --> 04:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
investors those people those people or
 
04:31:03.510 --> 04:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
organizations who are not intending to
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
occupy the home uh but to rent it out uh
 
04:31:09.269 --> 04:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
or to hold it and flip it or whatever
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
lower in new hampshire than we see
 
04:31:14.309 --> 04:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
nationally so but not a whole lot lower
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
nationally 6.3 percent near new
 
04:31:18.950 --> 04:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire 5.1 percent
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
and then second home purchases
 
04:31:23.349 --> 04:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
much higher 50 percent higher here in
 
04:31:25.429 --> 04:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire well if you think about
 
04:31:28.469 --> 04:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
the activity we see in uh in the lakes
 
04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
region the mount washington valley parts
 
04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
of the north country yeah that makes a
 
04:31:34.229 --> 04:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
lot of sense there especially in in
 
04:31:37.030 --> 04:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
carroll county uh where we see i think
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
it's 48
 
04:31:42.630 --> 04:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
of the homes 48 of all
 
04:31:44.790 --> 04:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
owner occupied homes
 
04:31:48.469 --> 04:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
are in fact vacant meaning they're owned
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
by someone as a second home
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
48 in carroll county mount washington
 
04:31:53.279 --> 04:31:54.630 align:start position:0%
48 in carroll county mount washington
valley

04:31:54.630 --> 04:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
valley
 
04:31:57.110 --> 04:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
and that is the highest in the state
 
04:31:59.189 --> 04:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
and then just looking at the uh the
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
percentage of purchase mortgages versus
 
04:32:03.110 --> 04:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
refi mortgages at the bottom and the
 
04:32:05.189 --> 04:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
distribution among the different types
 
04:32:05.199 --> 04:32:06.710 align:start position:0%
distribution among the different types
of

04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:32:09.030 --> 04:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
mortgage products they're using
 
04:32:14.710 --> 04:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:16.149 --> 04:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
this is i think a particularly
 
04:32:18.469 --> 04:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
interesting slide this is a comparison
 
04:32:20.309 --> 04:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
of the unemployment rate the orange
 
04:32:23.110 --> 04:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
curve and mortgage delinquencies and it
 
04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's what you would expect to see
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
as people lose their jobs
 
04:32:29.910 --> 04:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
and we see this at the beginning of the
 
04:32:32.309 --> 04:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
pandemic where the unemployment rate
 
04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and nationally shot up
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
really fast
 
04:32:40.229 --> 04:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
we saw a uh an increase in delinquencies
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
but it has really come down um as the
 
04:32:45.510 --> 04:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
economy has improved people as people
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
have gone back to work as they've
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
figured out how to deal with their their
 
04:32:52.149 --> 04:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
financial situations and as the
 
04:32:54.149 --> 04:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate has come down you know
 
04:32:56.309 --> 04:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
we are the i think the second lowest
 
04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate in the country at uh
 
04:33:03.429 --> 04:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:03.439 --> 04:33:04.390 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:07.990 --> 04:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
moving on now to um slide 16 and uh uh
 
04:33:09.830 --> 04:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman this this is the question
 
04:33:11.990 --> 04:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
you were asking before about you know uh
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
what's the impact of out-of-state buyers
 
04:33:16.949 --> 04:33:16.959 align:start position:0%
where are where are these people coming
 
04:33:19.109 --> 04:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
from who are buying in new hampshire uh
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
04:33:21.349 --> 04:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
whether they're buying in sullivan
 
04:33:22.709 --> 04:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
county or they're buying in rockingham
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
county where are they coming from
 
04:33:27.510 --> 04:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
um and there's especially if you're if
 
04:33:28.709 --> 04:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
you're reading the headlines you say
 
04:33:30.869 --> 04:33:30.879 align:start position:0%
well there are these hordes of people
 
04:33:31.990 --> 04:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
coming across the border from
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and and snapping up homes
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
and from one neighborhood to another
 
04:33:38.709 --> 04:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
from one town to another that may be
 
04:33:40.390 --> 04:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
that may be true but if you look at the
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
overall patterns
 
04:33:45.269 --> 04:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
there has been some increase
 
04:33:47.670 --> 04:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the proportion of buyers in
 
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
particular from massachusetts
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
but still most of the buyers here in new
 
04:33:55.349 --> 04:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire are already here
 
04:33:56.709 --> 04:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
the middle point here in italics most
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
buyers are local to their own markets
 
04:34:03.429 --> 04:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
not just statewide but people generally
 
04:34:05.189 --> 04:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
speaking who are buying in new hampshire
 
04:34:06.789 --> 04:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
are already in
 
04:34:09.269 --> 04:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
the the housing markets where they're
 
04:34:11.189 --> 04:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
buying they're selling one home buying
 
04:34:13.189 --> 04:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
another or they're moving up from being
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
a renter to buying a home within the
 
04:34:17.269 --> 04:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
existing housing market where they
 
04:34:19.750 --> 04:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
already live
 
04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
that said there are some some regional
 
04:34:23.510 --> 04:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
influences that are really important
 
04:34:25.750 --> 04:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
that drive this activity from other
 
04:34:25.760 --> 04:34:26.949 align:start position:0%
that drive this activity from other
states

04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:34:29.670 --> 04:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
in particular from from massachusetts
 
04:34:31.109 --> 04:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
the the pull
 
04:34:33.590 --> 04:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
of the upper valley dartmouth college
 
04:34:33.600 --> 04:34:34.470 align:start position:0%
of the upper valley dartmouth college
and

04:34:34.470 --> 04:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:38.070 --> 04:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
and dh health and other associated
 
04:34:40.230 --> 04:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
organizations in the area a lot of
 
04:34:42.310 --> 04:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
high-tech activity that's been spun off
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
from the um
 
04:34:46.629 --> 04:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
the incubator there
 
04:34:49.029 --> 04:34:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh the pull of the lakes region the pull
 
04:34:52.070 --> 04:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the mountains and i'll call it
 
04:34:53.830 --> 04:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
maybe this is improper to say but the
 
04:34:57.750 --> 04:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
repulsive or the propulsive influence of
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
boston because of its cost
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
so it's pushing people
 
04:35:05.349 --> 04:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
out away from boston into new hampshire
 
04:35:07.109 --> 04:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire is a particularly
 
04:35:09.029 --> 04:35:09.039 align:start position:0%
attractive place to be so why wouldn't
 
04:35:11.429 --> 04:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
they come here and they do so those are
 
04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
some influences that influence you know
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
particular markets uh so we see a lot of
 
04:35:19.750 --> 04:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
activity uh in uh the in the upper
 
04:35:22.070 --> 04:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
valley where there is a relatively
 
04:35:24.789 --> 04:35:24.799 align:start position:0%
higher proportion of mortgage purchases
 
04:35:26.629 --> 04:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
than there is statewide and i think
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
that's the the impact of those the
 
04:35:30.390 --> 04:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
industries they are pulling people to
 
04:35:32.310 --> 04:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
the upper valley and then of course
 
04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
there's the second home purchasers in
 
04:35:40.150 --> 04:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
the next slide here we're talking really
 
04:35:44.551 --> 04:35:44.561 align:start position:0%
just about population trends and we've
 
04:35:45.670 --> 04:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
heard about
 
04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
and this is drawing on the work that uh
 
04:35:49.990 --> 04:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
ken johnson from the car seat school has
 
04:35:50.000 --> 04:35:51.510 align:start position:0%
ken johnson from the car seat school has
done

04:35:51.510 --> 04:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:35:53.189 --> 04:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
now the population growth in new
 
04:35:56.230 --> 04:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i changed the title here i
 
04:35:57.750 --> 04:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
had said
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
modest and i said slow and it's both
 
04:36:02.949 --> 04:36:02.959 align:start position:0%
modest and slow population growth
 
04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know we're growing by you know
 
04:36:06.390 --> 04:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
something on the order of 5 000 people a
 
04:36:06.400 --> 04:36:07.510 align:start position:0%
something on the order of 5 000 people a
year

04:36:07.510 --> 04:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:36:11.269 --> 04:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
which is a a sharp uh difference from
 
04:36:13.830 --> 04:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
how new hampshire was growing say 20
 
04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
years ago when we were growing between
 
04:36:18.551 --> 04:36:18.561 align:start position:0%
50 and 20 000 people a year a new
 
04:36:20.789 --> 04:36:20.799 align:start position:0%
laconia every year in new hampshire not
 
04:36:22.390 --> 04:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
so much anymore it's more like
 
04:36:26.629 --> 04:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:27.670 --> 04:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
but still
 
04:36:29.750 --> 04:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
there is growth going on most of this
 
04:36:32.470 --> 04:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
now and and this is uh influenced by
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
what we see in the boston metro area is
 
04:36:36.551 --> 04:36:36.561 align:start position:0%
growth in the millennial population the
 
04:36:39.349 --> 04:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
largest uh generation when you talk
 
04:36:41.109 --> 04:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
about the baby boomer and how big the
 
04:36:42.949 --> 04:36:42.959 align:start position:0%
baby boomer population was well the
 
04:36:45.429 --> 04:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
millennial uh generation is actually the
 
04:36:47.670 --> 04:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
largest uh generational group that we
 
04:36:50.709 --> 04:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
see so they're entering into this
 
04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:52.959 align:start position:0%
market where they're purchasing homes
 
04:36:54.390 --> 04:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
now starting
 
04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
at maybe a later age than their their
 
04:36:58.470 --> 04:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
prior generations had but they are
 
04:37:00.869 --> 04:37:00.879 align:start position:0%
purchasing homes and they're moving to
 
04:37:03.109 --> 04:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
places where they want to work and where
 
04:37:04.949 --> 04:37:04.959 align:start position:0%
they want to live and that includes new
 
04:37:04.959 --> 04:37:06.390 align:start position:0%
they want to live and that includes new
hampshire

04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:37:08.709 --> 04:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
but recognize that even as new hampshire
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
is the fastest growing state in new
 
04:37:10.480 --> 04:37:11.349 align:start position:0%
is the fastest growing state in new
england

04:37:11.349 --> 04:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
england
 
04:37:14.470 --> 04:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
new england and the northeast as overall
 
04:37:16.390 --> 04:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
is a slow growing region so we're the
 
04:37:18.789 --> 04:37:18.799 align:start position:0%
fastest in this in the slowest growing
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:24.629 --> 04:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
it is buoyed a bit i say by
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
international uh immigration uh and and
 
04:37:29.189 --> 04:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
they'd say that's a good thing
 
04:37:31.269 --> 04:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we we see people coming to
 
04:37:33.670 --> 04:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire who are uh bringing a lot
 
04:37:36.310 --> 04:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
of talent uh to our industries and to
 
04:37:37.590 --> 04:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
our communities
 
04:37:39.750 --> 04:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
um and that is an influence i think that
 
04:37:42.470 --> 04:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
is pretty positive
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
some other growth that's going on and
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
and this is i think particularly in the
 
04:37:47.910 --> 04:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
early days of the pandemic we were
 
04:37:49.349 --> 04:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
reading about it in places like
 
04:37:51.429 --> 04:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
waterville valley and the mount
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
washington valley people
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
coming to occupy the second homes that
 
04:37:57.750 --> 04:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
they already owned or the third or
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
fourth or fifth homes that they already
 
04:37:59.119 --> 04:38:00.390 align:start position:0%
fourth or fifth homes that they already
owned

04:38:00.390 --> 04:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
owned
 
04:38:02.310 --> 04:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
and bring their kids with them because
 
04:38:04.390 --> 04:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
the kids were learning remotely anyway
 
04:38:06.310 --> 04:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
so why not go to the ski condo and the
 
04:38:09.109 --> 04:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
kids can you know be at school
 
04:38:10.949 --> 04:38:10.959 align:start position:0%
during the school days and then they can
 
04:38:12.709 --> 04:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
go out to the slopes
 
04:38:14.390 --> 04:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
that that happened a lot and we saw a
 
04:38:16.150 --> 04:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
dramatic increase in the waterville
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
valley school population for that year i
 
04:38:20.629 --> 04:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
think i i've not
 
04:38:22.230 --> 04:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
seen the actual numbers yet but i know
 
04:38:24.070 --> 04:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
that for the mount washington valley
 
04:38:26.070 --> 04:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
that has come back down to something
 
04:38:28.390 --> 04:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
more normal this year
 
04:38:28.400 --> 04:38:29.429 align:start position:0%
more normal this year
but

04:38:29.429 --> 04:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:38:30.869 --> 04:38:30.879 align:start position:0%
to the extent
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
some of that is
 
04:38:35.910 --> 04:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
a trend that sticks
 
04:38:37.590 --> 04:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
and this is a question how sticky are
 
04:38:39.910 --> 04:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
these trends going to be
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
those will have some implications for
 
04:38:44.551 --> 04:38:44.561 align:start position:0%
local school budgets in those areas
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
and because people already own those
 
04:38:48.629 --> 04:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
homes it's not reflected in sales
 
04:38:48.639 --> 04:38:51.349 align:start position:0%
homes it's not reflected in sales
activity

04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
the last thing i have here before i turn
 
04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
it back over to rob is the building
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:02.230 --> 04:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
this is a big part of the story of the
 
04:39:04.949 --> 04:39:04.959 align:start position:0%
housing market in new hampshire
 
04:39:07.269 --> 04:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
and we see going back to 2000 you see
 
04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
the level of activity that we had in the
 
04:39:11.830 --> 04:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
blue line is single family homes uh the
 
04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
orange line is uh multi-family
 
04:39:16.470 --> 04:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
construction which is highly variable
 
04:39:18.551 --> 04:39:18.561 align:start position:0%
year to year uh but if we were to do a
 
04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
trend line on the single family homes
 
04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%
you'd see a lot of activity going on in
 
04:39:24.709 --> 04:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
the early part
 
04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
of the the 2000s but then with the great
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
recession it dropped off precipitously
 
04:39:33.670 --> 04:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
and has not really recovered it's been i
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
call it a slim recovery and you see it
 
04:39:38.708 --> 04:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
trending upward but it's still nothing
 
04:39:41.110 --> 04:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
like uh the activity in building that we
 
04:39:45.910 --> 04:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
saw in the early part of the 2000s
 
04:39:45.920 --> 04:39:46.708 align:start position:0%
saw in the early part of the 2000s
now

04:39:46.708 --> 04:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:39:50.150 --> 04:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
the big question is why
 
04:39:52.070 --> 04:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
why aren't builders building more why is
 
04:39:54.310 --> 04:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
why don't we have more construction um
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a question that we're
 
04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
wrestling with uh right now and part of
 
04:40:00.628 --> 04:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
it is you know part of its local
 
04:40:04.550 --> 04:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
regulation that we have to address
 
04:40:06.150 --> 04:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
and that that's it for the the market
 
04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to turn it back to rob now to
 
04:40:08.160 --> 04:40:09.510 align:start position:0%
i'm going to turn it back to rob now to
um

04:40:09.510 --> 04:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:11.270 --> 04:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
do a few more
 
04:40:13.350 --> 04:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
closing comments but i think
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
ben would you take another question
 
04:40:17.430 --> 04:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
certainly representative alamedy
 
04:40:18.628 --> 04:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:40:20.470 --> 04:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
when i came home
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
i remember being told that when we had
 
04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
the major crash for new hampshire in the
 
04:40:29.510 --> 04:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
1990 1991
 
04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
that a whole lot of construction
 
04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
companies just gave up
 
04:40:38.310 --> 04:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
and disappeared and that after that
 
04:40:39.910 --> 04:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
they learned
 
04:40:42.830 --> 04:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
not to build on spec
 
04:40:46.070 --> 04:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
anymore and
 
04:40:48.788 --> 04:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of surprised actually that we
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
got up to that level of building in the
 
04:40:55.030 --> 04:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
early 2000s i didn't even
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
notice it in lebanon much
 
04:41:01.030 --> 04:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
that that's a great point representative
 
04:41:01.040 --> 04:41:01.830 align:start position:0%
that that's a great point representative
and

04:41:01.830 --> 04:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:04.868 --> 04:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
you're right uh for new hampshire the
 
04:41:07.270 --> 04:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
the you know 1990 that was our great
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
recession and we saw
 
04:41:11.430 --> 04:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of banks
 
04:41:14.550 --> 04:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
go into bankruptcy and go away
 
04:41:16.628 --> 04:41:16.638 align:start position:0%
you know think of all the names of banks
 
04:41:18.708 --> 04:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
that no longer exist in new hampshire
 
04:41:18.718 --> 04:41:19.830 align:start position:0%
that no longer exist in new hampshire
and

04:41:19.830 --> 04:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:22.708 --> 04:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
with them a lot of builders who
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons decided not to
 
04:41:28.150 --> 04:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
continue building here in new hampshire
 
04:41:31.590 --> 04:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
we had a very
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
high surplus of housing in new hampshire
 
04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
in the first part of that decade but
 
04:41:41.190 --> 04:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
that surplus was eaten up by 1995.
 
04:41:44.550 --> 04:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
and starting in 1995 we saw the prices
 
04:41:46.470 --> 04:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
of homes in new hampshire start to
 
04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
accelerate again and as a result we see
 
04:41:51.990 --> 04:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we saw that activity of home
 
04:41:55.510 --> 04:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
construction in the early 2000s
 
04:41:56.470 --> 04:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
which was
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
really a response to that demand
 
04:42:02.070 --> 04:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
that for for new homes so i'm not sure
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
that there was a lot of spec building
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
going on in the early 2000s
 
04:42:08.470 --> 04:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
but there there was a very high demand
 
04:42:10.708 --> 04:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
and we did not see uh you know
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
tremendously high vacancy rates as a
 
04:42:15.190 --> 04:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
result of the recession these homes were
 
04:42:16.948 --> 04:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
occupied people might have been
 
04:42:18.868 --> 04:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
underwater and so that they might have
 
04:42:20.550 --> 04:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
been compelled to stay in their homes
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
but they were in their homes
 
04:42:24.788 --> 04:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
and it just has not recovered part of
 
04:42:26.708 --> 04:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
the reason you're right is that there's
 
04:42:28.868 --> 04:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
insufficient skilled labor
 
04:42:31.750 --> 04:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
to do this and an insufficient number of
 
04:42:33.910 --> 04:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
smaller scale developers which is the
 
04:42:36.070 --> 04:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
kind of development we have seen we see
 
04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we don't have the
 
04:42:39.510 --> 04:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
massive builders that we see in other
 
04:42:41.350 --> 04:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
parts of the of the country
 
04:42:43.510 --> 04:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
we have smaller developers building
 
04:42:46.150 --> 04:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
smaller developments
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
next with
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative romney followed by
 
04:42:51.190 --> 04:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative aaron i just want to
 
04:42:55.270 --> 04:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay so we know
 
04:42:57.600 --> 04:42:59.190 align:start position:0%
okay so we know
background

04:42:59.190 --> 04:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
background
 
04:43:00.628 --> 04:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
interest rates are low
 
04:43:00.638 --> 04:43:03.110 align:start position:0%
interest rates are low
positive

04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
positive
 
04:43:05.830 --> 04:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
demand is high positive
 
04:43:08.708 --> 04:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
but still no one's building right
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
i mean let's just list the negatives
 
04:43:12.390 --> 04:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
right i mean the cost of the dirt is a
 
04:43:12.400 --> 04:43:13.350 align:start position:0%
right i mean the cost of the dirt is a
lot

04:43:13.350 --> 04:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
lot
 
04:43:15.990 --> 04:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
i mean if you're you're you're a bent
 
04:43:19.110 --> 04:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
builder that that costs a lot so you're
 
04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
not going to tend to build something
 
04:43:21.670 --> 04:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
cheap you're going to build something
 
04:43:21.680 --> 04:43:22.470 align:start position:0%
cheap you're going to build something
big

04:43:22.470 --> 04:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
big
 
04:43:24.708 --> 04:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
i would imagine to get return
 
04:43:25.990 --> 04:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
you'd be mentioned
 
04:43:28.150 --> 04:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
the skilled labor is not there
 
04:43:29.750 --> 04:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
now now
 
04:43:32.310 --> 04:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
in the last year cost the materials just
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
i mean it really went up
 
04:43:37.030 --> 04:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
now has that come back down a little bit
 
04:43:38.708 --> 04:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
do you guys know
 
04:43:40.550 --> 04:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
i hear rumors that it's come down from
 
04:43:42.708 --> 04:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
its peaks of what a what a
 
04:43:45.590 --> 04:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
piece of plywood costs or a 2x4 but
 
04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yeah certainly
 
04:43:49.750 --> 04:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
the cost of lumber peaked uh last year
 
04:43:51.990 --> 04:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
and has come down substantially but what
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
we have not seen uh improved is the
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
supply chain interruptions that have
 
04:43:59.190 --> 04:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
really bedeviled builders so things like
 
04:44:01.510 --> 04:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
appliances and garage doors we've had a
 
04:44:03.590 --> 04:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
number of projects that have been
 
04:44:05.350 --> 04:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
beset by delays and those kinds of
 
04:44:07.350 --> 04:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
deliveries that can result in a
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
certificate of occupancy being delayed
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
by a couple of months it's happening on
 
04:44:12.390 --> 04:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
the single family side as well
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
and as everybody knows time is money in
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
the construction business and so it's
 
04:44:17.750 --> 04:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
really uh driven up cost for the
 
04:44:19.430 --> 04:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
builders which is passed right down to
 
04:44:19.440 --> 04:44:20.470 align:start position:0%
builders which is passed right down to
consumer

04:44:20.470 --> 04:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
yeah my follow-up
 
04:44:23.830 --> 04:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
i mean in my town we had
 
04:44:25.510 --> 04:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
treat farms we have we still have some
 
04:44:27.910 --> 04:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
farms but you know they eventually
 
04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
either they go into conservation
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
or a builder
 
04:44:34.390 --> 04:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know an um developer
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
buys up the property
 
04:44:39.510 --> 04:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
and they built 18 our homes large but
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
big homes
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
not little teeny homes big homes oh just
 
04:44:44.230 --> 04:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
about everyone was over a million
 
04:44:44.240 --> 04:44:45.110 align:start position:0%
about everyone was over a million
dollars

04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:44:47.510 --> 04:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
and they they were gobbled up
 
04:44:50.470 --> 04:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
like you know the sign went up 18 lots
 
04:44:50.480 --> 04:44:52.230 align:start position:0%
like you know the sign went up 18 lots
available

04:44:52.230 --> 04:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:44:54.628 --> 04:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
i drove by like a couple weeks later it
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
was pretty much all sold
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
so i i guess that's
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
i mean i i guess these guys had no
 
04:45:03.110 --> 04:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
problem no choice but to buy build big
 
04:45:04.868 --> 04:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
homes to get the return on their
 
04:45:06.788 --> 04:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
investment but i mean are you seeing
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing i mean i'm just
 
04:45:12.868 --> 04:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
yeah we are and i think the point about
 
04:45:14.550 --> 04:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
larger homes still being built there's
 
04:45:16.470 --> 04:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
still a very strong market for large
 
04:45:16.480 --> 04:45:17.910 align:start position:0%
still a very strong market for large
homes

04:45:17.910 --> 04:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
homes
 
04:45:20.470 --> 04:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
make no mistake about that
 
04:45:23.590 --> 04:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
but in in many communities that's all
 
04:45:25.270 --> 04:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
builders can build because of the
 
04:45:26.948 --> 04:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
regulatory environment that they're
 
04:45:29.190 --> 04:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
they're presented
 
04:45:29.200 --> 04:45:29.990 align:start position:0%
they're presented
so

04:45:29.990 --> 04:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:32.470 --> 04:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have the choice of building
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
large or small even though there is a
 
04:45:37.990 --> 04:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
significantly growing market for smaller
 
04:45:40.788 --> 04:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
homes smaller lots right doesn't mean
 
04:45:42.310 --> 04:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that there isn't still a
 
04:45:44.708 --> 04:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
market for large homes there is
 
04:45:46.310 --> 04:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
but there is also this growing market
 
04:45:48.230 --> 04:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
for smaller homes but developers just
 
04:45:49.830 --> 04:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
can't build it because the regulations
 
04:45:51.910 --> 04:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
don't allow it right and i right and
 
04:45:53.510 --> 04:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
that was the other thing the regulations
 
04:45:54.788 --> 04:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
we've heard this before about the
 
04:45:56.550 --> 04:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
regulations being an issue in town to
 
04:45:56.560 --> 04:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
regulations being an issue in town to
town

04:45:57.510 --> 04:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:45:59.110 --> 04:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:46:01.750 --> 04:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative aaron thank you mr chair
 
04:46:01.760 --> 04:46:02.788 align:start position:0%
representative aaron thank you mr chair
and

04:46:02.788 --> 04:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:05.590 --> 04:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
most of what mr representative ramy said
 
04:46:07.670 --> 04:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
i was going to say but also
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
i want to
 
04:46:11.270 --> 04:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
ask you
 
04:46:14.788 --> 04:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
for this the slide that you had i guess
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
number 18
 
04:46:18.470 --> 04:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
the new new hampshire building permits
 
04:46:18.480 --> 04:46:20.070 align:start position:0%
the new new hampshire building permits
lagging

04:46:20.070 --> 04:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
lagging
 
04:46:22.788 --> 04:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
is included in that is also
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
any kind of modular homes
 
04:46:25.760 --> 04:46:26.868 align:start position:0%
any kind of modular homes
versus

04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
versus
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know like
 
04:46:30.788 --> 04:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
for real new construction because every
 
04:46:33.270 --> 04:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
single time i'm driving back to acworth
 
04:46:35.590 --> 04:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
from concord i'm seeing these modular
 
04:46:39.030 --> 04:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
homes on the on the road
 
04:46:40.948 --> 04:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
presumably being delivered somewhere in
 
04:46:42.150 --> 04:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:46:42.160 --> 04:46:43.190 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
so

04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:45.750 --> 04:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to me there's there's
 
04:46:48.868 --> 04:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of activity for that
 
04:46:51.830 --> 04:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
there is and and i i agree i i've done
 
04:46:53.910 --> 04:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
from warner so i'm you know i see them
 
04:46:55.750 --> 04:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
coming along they see half half of a
 
04:46:59.190 --> 04:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
house or a quarter of a house or uh you
 
04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
know truly modular homes
 
04:47:01.600 --> 04:47:02.390 align:start position:0%
know truly modular homes
so

04:47:02.390 --> 04:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:47:04.628 --> 04:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
just to distinguish legally
 
04:47:07.190 --> 04:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
a modular home would count as a
 
04:47:09.590 --> 04:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
single-family home manufactured housing
 
04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
which is
 
04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
legally different
 
04:47:15.910 --> 04:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
would not be included in this total here
 
04:47:15.920 --> 04:47:16.628 align:start position:0%
would not be included in this total here
but

04:47:16.628 --> 04:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:47:18.150 --> 04:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
but there is a really strong market for
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:23.040 --> 04:47:24.708 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

04:47:24.708 --> 04:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
04:47:27.750 --> 04:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so have land use
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
local regulations change dramatically in
 
04:47:33.990 --> 04:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:34.000 --> 04:47:35.180 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:47:35.180 --> 04:47:35.190 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:47:35.190 --> 04:47:36.550 align:start position:0%
well
[Music]

04:47:36.550 --> 04:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:47:37.670 --> 04:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
i'd say they've
 
04:47:37.680 --> 04:47:39.190 align:start position:0%
i'd say they've
changed

04:47:39.190 --> 04:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
changed
 
04:47:42.830 --> 04:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
over a longer period of time than that
 
04:47:42.840 --> 04:47:44.708 align:start position:0%
over a longer period of time than that
and

04:47:44.708 --> 04:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:46.070 --> 04:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
what we've
 
04:47:46.080 --> 04:47:47.670 align:start position:0%
what we've
seen

04:47:47.670 --> 04:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
seen
 
04:47:51.510 --> 04:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
over the past say 30 to 40 years is a
 
04:47:53.350 --> 04:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
gradual tightening
 
04:47:55.830 --> 04:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
of the land use regulations
 
04:47:55.840 --> 04:47:57.110 align:start position:0%
of the land use regulations
as

04:47:57.110 --> 04:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:47:59.750 --> 04:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
local boards have become
 
04:48:02.868 --> 04:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
more sophisticated uh more knowledgeable
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
about what the
 
04:48:06.868 --> 04:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
their legal constraints are so they're
 
04:48:06.878 --> 04:48:07.830 align:start position:0%
their legal constraints are so they're
acting

04:48:07.830 --> 04:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
acting
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
in many cases legally
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
but they're doing so in such a way that
 
04:48:14.550 --> 04:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
prevents a broader range of development
 
04:48:16.310 --> 04:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
from happening
 
04:48:16.320 --> 04:48:20.230 align:start position:0%
from happening
follow-up

04:48:20.230 --> 04:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:20.240 --> 04:48:21.430 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

04:48:21.430 --> 04:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:48:22.708 --> 04:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at your graph and
 
04:48:24.868 --> 04:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
basically you know things were really
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
sparking along there 2000 2001 was only
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
20 years ago right and then they fell
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
off a cliff
 
04:48:32.150 --> 04:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
so the regulations haven't changed but
 
04:48:35.830 --> 04:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
the implementation has been the thing
 
04:48:37.750 --> 04:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's a good observation
 
04:48:39.990 --> 04:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
yes implementation has changed as as
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
boards have gotten more as i say more
 
04:48:43.750 --> 04:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
sophisticated and how they're using
 
04:48:45.590 --> 04:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
their regulations
 
04:48:45.600 --> 04:48:46.470 align:start position:0%
their regulations
but

04:48:46.470 --> 04:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:48:48.868 --> 04:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
this is also influenced by the lack of
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
builders the cost of materials a variety
 
04:48:54.470 --> 04:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
of different factors um one of the
 
04:48:54.480 --> 04:48:55.270 align:start position:0%
of different factors um one of the
things

04:48:55.270 --> 04:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
a point that we've made a number of
 
04:48:58.310 --> 04:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
times is that
 
04:48:59.830 --> 04:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
there are certain factors we can't
 
04:49:01.510 --> 04:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
control we can't control the cost of
 
04:49:03.190 --> 04:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
materials we can't control the cost of a
 
04:49:05.350 --> 04:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
two by four coming from wherever it's
 
04:49:08.310 --> 04:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
coming from but the local regulations is
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
something we can
 
04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
influence and control and so that's why
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
we focus on that so much
 
04:49:18.150 --> 04:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative alame
 
04:49:20.150 --> 04:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd like to throw something
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
else into the mix that i don't think
 
04:49:24.070 --> 04:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
we've talked about
 
04:49:26.230 --> 04:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
but we deal with in lebanon
 
04:49:27.910 --> 04:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
a lot and
 
04:49:29.830 --> 04:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
other places do too
 
04:49:29.840 --> 04:49:31.110 align:start position:0%
other places do too
on

04:49:31.110 --> 04:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:49:33.750 --> 04:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
water and sewer systems
 
04:49:36.470 --> 04:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
they were built mostly at the turn of
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
the previous century
 
04:49:41.750 --> 04:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
they have been falling apart and they
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
also are in a lot of places
 
04:49:44.638 --> 04:49:45.590 align:start position:0%
also are in a lot of places
near

04:49:45.590 --> 04:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
near
 
04:49:45.600 --> 04:49:47.430 align:start position:0%
near
capacity

04:49:47.430 --> 04:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
04:49:47.440 --> 04:49:48.230 align:start position:0%
capacity
on

04:49:48.230 --> 04:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:49:48.240 --> 04:49:48.948 align:start position:0%
on
and

04:49:48.948 --> 04:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:52.230 --> 04:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
they are in the core areas
 
04:49:52.240 --> 04:49:53.350 align:start position:0%
they are in the core areas
that

04:49:53.350 --> 04:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:53.360 --> 04:49:55.910 align:start position:0%
that
on

04:49:55.910 --> 04:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:58.550 --> 04:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
that are restricted into how much land
 
04:49:59.670 --> 04:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
is left
 
04:50:02.070 --> 04:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
that you can build in unless
 
04:50:05.990 --> 04:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
you can convince your constituents to
 
04:50:06.000 --> 04:50:07.350 align:start position:0%
you can convince your constituents to
allow

04:50:07.350 --> 04:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
allow
 
04:50:07.360 --> 04:50:08.628 align:start position:0%
allow
towers

04:50:08.628 --> 04:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
towers
 
04:50:12.550 --> 04:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
as versus single-family homes and uh
 
04:50:15.670 --> 04:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's pretty difficult
 
04:50:18.230 --> 04:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
do you do you think that the water sewer
 
04:50:21.430 --> 04:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
costs of upgrades which are huge uh
 
04:50:23.190 --> 04:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
we've been doing this for some time now
 
04:50:24.310 --> 04:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be doing it for the
 
04:50:27.190 --> 04:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
next 50 years
 
04:50:28.948 --> 04:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
is part of this
 
04:50:30.788 --> 04:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry is is what
 
04:50:33.910 --> 04:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
is part of oh yes this
 
04:50:36.628 --> 04:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
this problem of having to restrict to
 
04:50:39.830 --> 04:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
the areas that have water and sewer now
 
04:50:42.070 --> 04:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
but not to overload them
 
04:50:44.868 --> 04:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
it is part of it and in fact we
 
04:50:47.590 --> 04:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
recognize that the the presence of
 
04:50:51.190 --> 04:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
public water and public sewer systems
 
04:50:53.910 --> 04:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
is important i don't want to say
 
04:50:56.470 --> 04:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
essential but it is important
 
04:50:56.480 --> 04:50:57.270 align:start position:0%
essential but it is important
for

04:50:57.270 --> 04:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
increasing the housing supply because
 
04:51:00.868 --> 04:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
that's where you can do denser
 
04:51:03.990 --> 04:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
development and i i would i would say it
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the alternatives are not
 
04:51:09.190 --> 04:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
single-family homes and towers there are
 
04:51:11.750 --> 04:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
some things in between as well
 
04:51:14.070 --> 04:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
that can be accommodated
 
04:51:16.390 --> 04:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
by municipalities with public water and
 
04:51:16.400 --> 04:51:17.430 align:start position:0%
by municipalities with public water and
sewer

04:51:17.430 --> 04:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
sewer
 
04:51:19.350 --> 04:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
without you know
 
04:51:21.030 --> 04:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
substantially changing the character of
 
04:51:29.110 --> 04:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:30.628 --> 04:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:51:30.638 --> 04:51:31.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
sorry

04:51:31.990 --> 04:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
so i'll provide a few concluding
 
04:51:35.270 --> 04:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
comments before i do that while we're
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
still looking at this building permits
 
04:51:38.948 --> 04:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
slide i just wanted to add one other
 
04:51:40.550 --> 04:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
thought with respect to your question
 
04:51:42.788 --> 04:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
representative irf and i think that is
 
04:51:44.150 --> 04:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
it would be a mistake to assume that
 
04:51:46.390 --> 04:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
because 20 years ago there was a robust
 
04:51:49.110 --> 04:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
pace of construction that at that time
 
04:51:51.030 --> 04:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
communities had zoning regulations that
 
04:51:52.628 --> 04:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
were appropriate to keep pace with the
 
04:51:55.350 --> 04:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
rate of growth that was occurring
 
04:51:56.550 --> 04:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
you know i've heard people say their
 
04:51:58.628 --> 04:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
community is built out and while that
 
04:52:01.030 --> 04:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
may be somewhat true based on their
 
04:52:04.150 --> 04:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
current zoning and 30 000 square foot
 
04:52:06.628 --> 04:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
minimum lot sizes you know every one of
 
04:52:08.788 --> 04:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
those 30 000 foot
 
04:52:10.470 --> 04:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
lots could accommodate
 
04:52:11.830 --> 04:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
more units than is currently being
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
accommodated on it so it may just be
 
04:52:15.430 --> 04:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
that the capacity based on the current
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
zoning regulations which have been in
 
04:52:18.390 --> 04:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
place for some decades
 
04:52:20.708 --> 04:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
has been absorbed and so the market's
 
04:52:22.230 --> 04:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
ability to respond to the increased
 
04:52:22.240 --> 04:52:23.430 align:start position:0%
ability to respond to the increased
demand

04:52:23.430 --> 04:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
demand
 
04:52:25.830 --> 04:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
is no longer there
 
04:52:27.910 --> 04:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so
 
04:52:30.150 --> 04:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
i believe this is our last our last
 
04:52:32.230 --> 04:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
content rich slide and so i'll
 
04:52:33.910 --> 04:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
as i said provide a few other comments
 
04:52:36.390 --> 04:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
on the topic of interest rates i wanted
 
04:52:37.830 --> 04:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
to actually provide a little bit of
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
additional sort of late breaking news
 
04:52:41.510 --> 04:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
and more recent developments and it's
 
04:52:42.788 --> 04:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
hard to see
 
04:52:44.948 --> 04:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
exactly where this will go from here but
 
04:52:45.910 --> 04:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:52:47.110 --> 04:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
historically low interest rates of
 
04:52:48.310 --> 04:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
course are a double-edged sword because
 
04:52:50.550 --> 04:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
they help with affordability uh they're
 
04:52:52.390 --> 04:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
great if you're selling a house as ben
 
04:52:52.400 --> 04:52:53.270 align:start position:0%
great if you're selling a house as ben
said

04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:52:53.280 --> 04:52:54.310 align:start position:0%
said
um

04:52:54.310 --> 04:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
but uh they they fuel the runaway uh
 
04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
home price increases that have made it
 
04:53:00.868 --> 04:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
so hard for people to
 
04:53:03.190 --> 04:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
afford houses uh there it's sort of
 
04:53:05.030 --> 04:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
commonly understood that increases that
 
04:53:07.110 --> 04:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
you hear about in the headlines
 
04:53:10.150 --> 04:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
from the federal reserve will sort of uh
 
04:53:12.150 --> 04:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
advance in lockstep in terms of home
 
04:53:13.510 --> 04:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
mortgage lending rates that's not
 
04:53:16.150 --> 04:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily true it has a lot to do with
 
04:53:18.310 --> 04:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh the flow of capital and so the
 
04:53:19.910 --> 04:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
uncertainty that we're seeing
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
internationally the tragic events in
 
04:53:23.590 --> 04:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
ukraine have resulted in a lot of
 
04:53:25.190 --> 04:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
capital wanting to come out of equities
 
04:53:27.030 --> 04:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
out of the stock market and back into
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
what's perceived as safer investments in
 
04:53:31.190 --> 04:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
bonds and mortgage revenue bonds and so
 
04:53:33.110 --> 04:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
we've actually seen just over the last
 
04:53:36.310 --> 04:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks a marked decline in uh
 
04:53:37.990 --> 04:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
in mortgage rates not back to where they
 
04:53:40.230 --> 04:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
were in december 2020
 
04:53:42.708 --> 04:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
but if the uncertainty persists then it
 
04:53:44.470 --> 04:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
could be with that we're headed back
 
04:53:47.110 --> 04:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
into record territory in terms of uh in
 
04:53:49.270 --> 04:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
terms of interest rates
 
04:53:49.280 --> 04:53:50.070 align:start position:0%
terms of interest rates
so

04:53:50.070 --> 04:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
a number of these uh topics have already
 
04:53:54.868 --> 04:53:54.878 align:start position:0%
been covered and i won't uh belabor the
 
04:53:57.750 --> 04:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
points about the low inventory and and
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
the the ways in which this problem has
 
04:54:01.830 --> 04:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
been some decades in the making i just
 
04:54:04.390 --> 04:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to sort of uh bring it back with
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of comments that may be
 
04:54:07.590 --> 04:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat outside of the scope of this
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
presentation but i think are important
 
04:54:10.708 --> 04:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
for understanding it
 
04:54:13.190 --> 04:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know after a similar presentation
 
04:54:15.190 --> 04:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
five or six years ago where
 
04:54:17.430 --> 04:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
the slide about the percentage of
 
04:54:19.510 --> 04:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
apartment units that were affordable to
 
04:54:21.830 --> 04:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
the median renter household was shown at
 
04:54:23.430 --> 04:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
that time it was nowhere near as bad you
 
04:54:25.590 --> 04:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
saw today it's 13 percent statewide i
 
04:54:27.750 --> 04:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
think at that time it was 20 or 25
 
04:54:29.590 --> 04:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
percent of the apartment units and
 
04:54:29.600 --> 04:54:30.390 align:start position:0%
percent of the apartment units and
somebody

04:54:30.390 --> 04:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
04:54:33.030 --> 04:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
at my table said that makes no sense i
 
04:54:35.110 --> 04:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
live in uh franklin and i drive to
 
04:54:36.868 --> 04:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
concord all the time and i see
 
04:54:38.550 --> 04:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh all these apartment buildings are
 
04:54:40.550 --> 04:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
full so somebody's affording something
 
04:54:42.550 --> 04:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
and of course he's right the apartment
 
04:54:43.990 --> 04:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
buildings are full and people are
 
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
finding ways to make it work but i think
 
04:54:47.110 --> 04:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
what you don't see when you drive by an
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
apartment building with a full parking
 
04:54:50.070 --> 04:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
lot is that
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
increasing number of renters and
 
04:54:54.390 --> 04:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
homeowners and particularly new home
 
04:54:56.390 --> 04:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
buyers are cost burdened
 
04:54:58.070 --> 04:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
that standard in terms of affordability
 
04:55:00.390 --> 04:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
was based on a long-standing federal
 
04:55:03.750 --> 04:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
standard uh that 30 of one's income is
 
04:55:05.430 --> 04:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
an appropriate amount to spend for rent
 
04:55:08.708 --> 04:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
and increasingly we see this uh on our
 
04:55:10.470 --> 04:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh in our home mortgage lending and you
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
see it across the industry that more and
 
04:55:14.230 --> 04:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
more people have uh debt to income
 
04:55:17.190 --> 04:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
ratios approaching 50 percent
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
and what that means in terms of our
 
04:55:21.190 --> 04:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
communities is that
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
those those households are less
 
04:55:24.708 --> 04:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
financially resilient they're less able
 
04:55:26.470 --> 04:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
to respond when
 
04:55:28.470 --> 04:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
inflation occurs when gas prices go up
 
04:55:29.990 --> 04:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
to three
 
04:55:33.190 --> 04:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
350 or four dollars per gallon uh
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
increasingly they have longer commutes
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
that have
 
04:55:38.390 --> 04:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
attended costs child care challenges
 
04:55:40.070 --> 04:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
that in turn affects our labor force
 
04:55:42.070 --> 04:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
participation rate and makes it
 
04:55:43.590 --> 04:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
more difficult for our businesses to be
 
04:55:43.600 --> 04:55:44.788 align:start position:0%
more difficult for our businesses to be
competitive

04:55:44.788 --> 04:55:44.798 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
04:55:44.798 --> 04:55:45.670 align:start position:0%
competitive
so

04:55:45.670 --> 04:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:55:47.670 --> 04:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
i've been at new hampshire housing for
 
04:55:48.868 --> 04:55:48.878 align:start position:0%
seven years
 
04:55:50.550 --> 04:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
we do housing and we've always seen this
 
04:55:51.990 --> 04:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
as a problem that's important to solve i
 
04:55:52.000 --> 04:55:52.788 align:start position:0%
as a problem that's important to solve i
think

04:55:52.788 --> 04:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:55:54.470 --> 04:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
never more than today have we seen how
 
04:55:57.110 --> 04:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
interrelated it is with our uh with our
 
04:55:58.868 --> 04:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
state's economic vitality and
 
04:55:58.878 --> 04:56:00.150 align:start position:0%
state's economic vitality and
competitiveness

04:56:00.150 --> 04:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
competitiveness
 
04:56:02.788 --> 04:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
uh and and and also the public health of
 
04:56:05.190 --> 04:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
our citizens and and i know that you and
 
04:56:06.550 --> 04:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
many of your colleagues appreciate that
 
04:56:08.310 --> 04:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
as well and that's reflected in some of
 
04:56:10.070 --> 04:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
the activity in the legislature that's
 
04:56:12.070 --> 04:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
designed to address the housing crisis
 
04:56:12.080 --> 04:56:13.030 align:start position:0%
designed to address the housing crisis
so

04:56:13.030 --> 04:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that work and we
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time today and we're
 
04:56:16.628 --> 04:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any other questions you
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:23.760 --> 04:56:25.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:56:25.350 --> 04:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
opera money
 
04:56:29.190 --> 04:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
so we got about half we've only
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
encumbered about half of the billion
 
04:56:33.270 --> 04:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
dollars so there's 500 million
 
04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
kind of sitting there waiting for some
 
04:56:37.030 --> 04:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
place to go
 
04:56:39.750 --> 04:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
you have any ideas
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh we do and what helped us spend this
 
04:56:44.708 --> 04:56:44.718 align:start position:0%
money and so does the governor uh so
 
04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
we were pleased with the governor's
 
04:56:47.190 --> 04:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
announcement in the state of the state
 
04:56:48.868 --> 04:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
speech for the invest new hampshire fund
 
04:56:51.830 --> 04:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
which is okay uh 100 million dollars uh
 
04:56:53.670 --> 04:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
that he's intending to use the fiscal
 
04:56:55.350 --> 04:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
recovery funds for
 
04:56:56.470 --> 04:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:56:59.350 --> 04:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh we expect more details soon on
 
04:57:00.868 --> 04:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
exactly sort of the details of that
 
04:57:02.708 --> 04:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
program but that represents a
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
significant investment in in uh creating
 
04:57:07.270 --> 04:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
new housing so you you folks be involved
 
04:57:09.270 --> 04:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
with that a bit is that
 
04:57:11.190 --> 04:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
i believe so we're sort of working with
 
04:57:11.200 --> 04:57:11.990 align:start position:0%
i believe so we're sort of working with
the

04:57:11.990 --> 04:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:57:12.000 --> 04:57:13.030 align:start position:0%
the
uh

04:57:13.030 --> 04:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:57:14.550 --> 04:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
governor's office on learning more of
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
those details all right thank you
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so there goes one there goes
 
04:57:21.190 --> 04:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
one-fifth of what was left
 
04:57:22.230 --> 04:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
right there
 
04:57:23.430 --> 04:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:57:23.440 --> 04:57:25.670 align:start position:0%
thank you
representation

04:57:25.670 --> 04:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
representation
 
04:57:27.510 --> 04:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
 
04:57:29.110 --> 04:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
presentation today
 
04:57:29.120 --> 04:57:33.030 align:start position:0%
presentation today
um

04:57:33.030 --> 04:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:35.910 --> 04:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
i just forgot what my question was
 
04:57:35.920 --> 04:57:37.990 align:start position:0%
i just forgot what my question was
um

04:57:37.990 --> 04:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:39.830 --> 04:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'll have to
 
04:57:39.840 --> 04:57:41.030 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'll have to
okay

04:57:41.030 --> 04:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:57:44.310 --> 04:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
representing almi yeah i was counting up
 
04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
while the governor was speaking and he
 
04:57:49.030 --> 04:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
spent just about all of that 500 000
 
04:57:52.550 --> 04:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
i think about 200 i mean million about
 
04:57:54.708 --> 04:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
200 million of it was something that jeb
 
04:57:57.110 --> 04:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
bradley was going to do
 
04:57:59.430 --> 04:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
04:58:05.190 --> 04:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:08.470 --> 04:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you both for all the
 
04:58:10.788 --> 04:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
amazingly good work you're doing
 
04:58:10.798 --> 04:58:12.708 align:start position:0%
amazingly good work you're doing
um

04:58:12.708 --> 04:58:12.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
so i've been sitting here puzzling over
 
04:58:14.878 --> 04:58:15.910 align:start position:0%
so i've been sitting here puzzling over
why

04:58:15.910 --> 04:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:58:17.990 --> 04:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know the big question why
 
04:58:20.550 --> 04:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
why are things so tight housing is so
 
04:58:20.560 --> 04:58:21.910 align:start position:0%
why are things so tight housing is so
tight

04:58:21.910 --> 04:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
tight
 
04:58:23.350 --> 04:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
um down
 
04:58:25.030 --> 04:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know these slow these numbers that
 
04:58:26.550 --> 04:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
you've gone over
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:58:31.110 --> 04:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
and uh at the same time our population
 
04:58:33.270 --> 04:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
isn't that much greater
 
04:58:33.280 --> 04:58:34.310 align:start position:0%
isn't that much greater
um

04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:36.150 --> 04:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
and we probably got as much housing as
 
04:58:37.590 --> 04:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
we used to have
 
04:58:41.030 --> 04:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
and probably a little bit more um
 
04:58:42.868 --> 04:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:58:45.510 --> 04:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
so we've got uh people buying houses as
 
04:58:48.310 --> 04:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
second homes that's going on and maybe
 
04:58:50.868 --> 04:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
there's a short-term housing
 
04:58:53.190 --> 04:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
activity going on that's
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
taking uh
 
04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
sort of residential housing out and
 
04:59:01.110 --> 04:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
replacing it with uh transit people are
 
04:59:04.310 --> 04:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
going moving through and just here first
 
04:59:06.628 --> 04:59:06.638 align:start position:0%
for vacation or whatever
 
04:59:06.638 --> 04:59:08.390 align:start position:0%
for vacation or whatever
um

04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:10.868 --> 04:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
and then there's the differentials
 
04:59:12.310 --> 04:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
within the
 
04:59:14.230 --> 04:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
housing market of
 
04:59:16.868 --> 04:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
the high end and the low end and uh the
 
04:59:16.878 --> 04:59:18.788 align:start position:0%
the high end and the low end and uh the
workforce

04:59:18.788 --> 04:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
04:59:21.430 --> 04:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh place
 
04:59:23.670 --> 04:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:59:26.230 --> 04:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't all add up to me maybe
 
04:59:27.430 --> 04:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
you can uh
 
04:59:28.550 --> 04:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
try to
 
04:59:30.868 --> 04:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
help me understand so that so that we
 
04:59:30.878 --> 04:59:31.590 align:start position:0%
help me understand so that so that we
can

04:59:31.590 --> 04:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:59:31.600 --> 04:59:32.628 align:start position:0%
can
look

04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
look
 
04:59:35.190 --> 04:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
sensibly at interventions and i know
 
04:59:38.788 --> 04:59:38.798 align:start position:0%
that's much too big a question but
 
04:59:41.190 --> 04:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
maybe you could take a whack at it
 
04:59:43.350 --> 04:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
a household formula for formation is
 
04:59:45.910 --> 04:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
another thing the size of households
 
04:59:45.920 --> 04:59:47.110 align:start position:0%
another thing the size of households
um

04:59:47.110 --> 04:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
if more people are scrunching into
 
04:59:54.550 --> 04:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
a two-bedroom unit then uh
 
04:59:56.470 --> 04:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know you need less housing i guess
 
04:59:58.708 --> 04:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
if more people feel
 
05:00:00.868 --> 05:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
each each of them has to have their own
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
unit then
 
05:00:05.590 --> 05:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
um that leads you to a totally different
 
05:00:07.830 --> 05:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
count of housing needed
 
05:00:10.150 --> 05:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
you have a question that's it i'd just
 
05:00:12.868 --> 05:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
like them to speak to this larger
 
05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:18.868 --> 05:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
we could mr chair if you'd like we could
 
05:00:20.708 --> 05:00:20.718 align:start position:0%
certainly uh
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
respond uh to to that comment and
 
05:00:25.830 --> 05:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
i guess i would just say representative
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
ames uh thank you for those uh
 
05:00:29.590 --> 05:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
for your kind words and and for your
 
05:00:31.590 --> 05:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
comments i think the the last point that
 
05:00:32.788 --> 05:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
you made is actually a very important
 
05:00:34.868 --> 05:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
one which is about household size and
 
05:00:36.550 --> 05:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing did a study in
 
05:00:36.560 --> 05:00:38.150 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing did a study in
2014

05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
2014
 
05:00:39.510 --> 05:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
essentially predicting this trend and
 
05:00:42.070 --> 05:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
observing the change in household size
 
05:00:43.270 --> 05:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:00:44.868 --> 05:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
while our population and our housing
 
05:00:46.390 --> 05:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
stock has increased over the last couple
 
05:00:49.510 --> 05:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
of decades uh you know in in the 70s and
 
05:00:52.070 --> 05:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
80s there were far more households where
 
05:00:53.670 --> 05:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
there was a family of six or seven
 
05:00:55.830 --> 05:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
living in a in a three or four bedroom
 
05:00:55.840 --> 05:00:56.868 align:start position:0%
living in a in a three or four bedroom
house

05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
or in some cases a smaller house and and
 
05:01:01.750 --> 05:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
so that's one housing unit and six or
 
05:01:03.910 --> 05:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
seven people it's far more likely today
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
that you'll have
 
05:01:07.430 --> 05:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh three or four households among those
 
05:01:08.948 --> 05:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
six or seven people if that makes sense
 
05:01:11.270 --> 05:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
and so the number of housing units
 
05:01:13.670 --> 05:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
has not kept pace uh even though you're
 
05:01:16.310 --> 05:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
correct that it has grown uh as our
 
05:01:18.150 --> 05:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
population has grown
 
05:01:18.160 --> 05:01:20.230 align:start position:0%
population has grown
okay

05:01:20.230 --> 05:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
we are out of time on this
 
05:01:24.470 --> 05:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
and if you have any further questions
 
05:01:28.230 --> 05:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
i've talked to them on the side
 
05:01:30.150 --> 05:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
because we do have schedule at two
 
05:01:30.160 --> 05:01:31.110 align:start position:0%
because we do have schedule at two
o'clock

05:01:31.110 --> 05:01:31.120 align:start position:0%

committee in the early days of the
pandemic

05:03:20.230 --> 05:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
05:03:24.628 --> 05:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
so is now yours partition
 
05:03:26.550 --> 05:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so much chair and to the rest
 
05:03:27.910 --> 05:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you so much i
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
realize i'm in the unenviable position
 
05:03:32.708 --> 05:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
of being last on what was probably a
 
05:03:34.390 --> 05:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
very long day i'm glad you have the
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
window the curtains closed there because
 
05:03:38.550 --> 05:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
the sun is beautiful outside even though
 
05:03:40.868 --> 05:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
it is still quite chilly
 
05:03:42.310 --> 05:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
so it's not quite spring although it
 
05:03:43.910 --> 05:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
feels like it
 
05:03:46.390 --> 05:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
before i begin i just want to note that
 
05:03:49.030 --> 05:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
much of our work in public health is
 
05:03:51.030 --> 05:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
only possible with the support and
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
engagement of all of our policy makers
 
05:03:56.150 --> 05:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
you make our budgets
 
05:03:58.230 --> 05:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
and you hold us accountable and
 
05:04:00.150 --> 05:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic the health of
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
many new hampshire residents and the
 
05:04:04.708 --> 05:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
health of our businesses and the health
 
05:04:06.788 --> 05:04:06.798 align:start position:0%
of our health care system has been
 
05:04:09.430 --> 05:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
dependent on the decisions that you make
 
05:04:11.110 --> 05:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you for holding that
 
05:04:14.070 --> 05:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility with care so i just
 
05:04:16.390 --> 05:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that before i started
 
05:04:17.910 --> 05:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
i've got to do too many things at once
 
05:04:20.310 --> 05:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
here i've got to move my slides here so
 
05:04:22.390 --> 05:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
here we go
 
05:04:23.830 --> 05:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
march 2nd
 
05:04:26.150 --> 05:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
was the two-year anniversary of the
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
first covid case in new hampshire and
 
05:04:31.510 --> 05:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
march 13th will be the anniversary of
 
05:04:34.230 --> 05:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
the governor's emergency order
 
05:04:36.470 --> 05:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
those first few months
 
05:04:39.590 --> 05:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
meant was a blur for many of us we had
 
05:04:41.830 --> 05:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
insufficient ppe
 
05:04:44.708 --> 05:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
the country ran out of the testing swabs
 
05:04:46.788 --> 05:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
to stick up your nose
 
05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
there was no vaccine everything ground
 
05:04:52.868 --> 05:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
to a halt and we had no idea what would
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
happen next
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
two years later the unh survey center
 
05:04:59.990 --> 05:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
suggests that seven in eight granite
 
05:05:03.190 --> 05:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
staters likely have some protection
 
05:05:05.590 --> 05:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
against covid19 either through
 
05:05:09.430 --> 05:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination or through recent infection
 
05:05:11.750 --> 05:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
since march 2020 there have been more
 
05:05:15.430 --> 05:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
than three hundred 000 cases of coven 19
 
05:05:17.590 --> 05:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the highest rate
 
05:05:21.190 --> 05:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
continues to be among 20 to 29 year olds
 
05:05:23.510 --> 05:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
prime working age adults
 
05:05:27.830 --> 05:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
january 15 2022 had the highest one-day
 
05:05:27.840 --> 05:05:28.708 align:start position:0%
january 15 2022 had the highest one-day
count

05:05:28.708 --> 05:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
count
 
05:05:28.718 --> 05:05:31.628 align:start position:0%
count
of

05:05:31.628 --> 05:05:31.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:34.070 --> 05:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
5724 new cases
 
05:05:38.430 --> 05:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:42.070 --> 05:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
3571 individuals have been hospitalized
 
05:05:44.628 --> 05:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
from a record one day total of about
 
05:05:44.638 --> 05:05:46.868 align:start position:0%
from a record one day total of about
478.

05:05:46.868 --> 05:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
478.
 
05:05:48.868 --> 05:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
that and that was back in december to
 
05:05:51.190 --> 05:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
the current number which is in the 70s
 
05:05:53.670 --> 05:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
and for that we are all very grateful
 
05:05:56.150 --> 05:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
about 40 kids have been hospitalized and
 
05:05:58.150 --> 05:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
there have been 25 cases of something
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
called misc which is the worst
 
05:06:03.110 --> 05:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
some of the worst outcomes that can
 
05:06:04.788 --> 05:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
happen for kids it's a multi-system
 
05:06:07.350 --> 05:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
inflammatory condition
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
and most devastating there have been
 
05:06:13.030 --> 05:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
about 2 400 deaths of granite staters
 
05:06:15.110 --> 05:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
since 2020.
 
05:06:18.390 --> 05:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
we only have one death of someone age
 
05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
zero to nine year old we only had one
 
05:06:22.708 --> 05:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
confirmed pediatric death
 
05:06:25.750 --> 05:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
we averaged a high of about 12 deaths a
 
05:06:28.628 --> 05:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
day in december and early january
 
05:06:31.430 --> 05:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
and just as vaccine became available and
 
05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
we had about 750 cases per day then
 
05:06:37.110 --> 05:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
one year later we have felt the
 
05:06:39.030 --> 05:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
long-term effect of delta and the
 
05:06:41.590 --> 05:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
beginning of omicron and we at the
 
05:06:43.190 --> 05:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
beginning of omicron we were averaging
 
05:06:46.070 --> 05:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
about 10 to 11 deaths a day
 
05:06:49.350 --> 05:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
and that at that point we had 3 000
 
05:06:51.430 --> 05:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
cases a day and i just mentioned that to
 
05:06:53.030 --> 05:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
sort of look at the difference of where
 
05:06:54.788 --> 05:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
we were and i'll scoot down to the next
 
05:06:58.550 --> 05:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:00.628 --> 05:07:00.638 align:start position:0%
i'll get to in a minute we'll get to the
 
05:07:03.350 --> 05:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
next part so
 
05:07:05.510 --> 05:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
as a public health official i always
 
05:07:07.510 --> 05:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
find it sobering to look at the leading
 
05:07:09.910 --> 05:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
causes of death in our state throughout
 
05:07:12.390 --> 05:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
my career here in public health this
 
05:07:15.750 --> 05:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
list has guided our priorities and our
 
05:07:18.310 --> 05:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
investments and while infectious
 
05:07:20.550 --> 05:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
diseases are commonly found in the top
 
05:07:23.190 --> 05:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
10 leading causes of death in low-income
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
countries never in our recent memory has
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
the u.s had an infectious disease in our
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
top ten never mind as the third or
 
05:07:33.670 --> 05:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
fourth leading cause of death in the
 
05:07:33.680 --> 05:07:35.110 align:start position:0%
fourth leading cause of death in the
state

05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:07:37.270 --> 05:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
covett has taught us that the gains
 
05:07:39.750 --> 05:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
against infectious disease in the 20th
 
05:07:42.550 --> 05:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
century through vaccine and therapeutics
 
05:07:45.430 --> 05:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
cannot be taken for granted
 
05:07:48.150 --> 05:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
due in much part to covid at the
 
05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
national level life expectancy at birth
 
05:07:57.190 --> 05:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
fell 1.8 years in 2020 from 78.8 years
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
in 2019 to 77 years in 2020 this was the
 
05:08:05.590 --> 05:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
largest single year decline in more than
 
05:08:09.430 --> 05:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
75 years since world war ii
 
05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
early in the pandemic there were
 
05:08:13.750 --> 05:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
individuals that questioned the validity
 
05:08:16.230 --> 05:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
of this data of the death data the
 
05:08:18.708 --> 05:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
underlying cause of death is the
 
05:08:21.750 --> 05:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
condition that initiates the chain of
 
05:08:24.550 --> 05:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
events that lead to a death
 
05:08:26.230 --> 05:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
when the death certificate is filled out
 
05:08:27.990 --> 05:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
by a physician the person who's
 
05:08:29.830 --> 05:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
reporting the cause of death is asked to
 
05:08:32.310 --> 05:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
identify that chain of events sort of
 
05:08:34.390 --> 05:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
like a causal pathway
 
05:08:36.550 --> 05:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
and working from that immediate cause
 
05:08:39.190 --> 05:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
takes us to the underlying cause so an
 
05:08:41.590 --> 05:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
example of that chain of event or a
 
05:08:44.470 --> 05:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
pathway would be viral pneumonia due to
 
05:08:47.628 --> 05:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
covet 19. that's the causal pathway
 
05:08:50.948 --> 05:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
covid19 causes the viral pneumonia which
 
05:08:53.510 --> 05:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
would then likely kill the person so
 
05:08:56.470 --> 05:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
covid19 in that instance is considered
 
05:08:59.670 --> 05:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
the underlying cause of death
 
05:09:02.550 --> 05:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
regardless i think we can all agree that
 
05:09:05.190 --> 05:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
more than 2 300 deaths in the state is
 
05:09:08.310 --> 05:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
far can you take questions yes i will
 
05:09:10.070 --> 05:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative i'm glad you touched on
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
that because that's a mystery to a lot
 
05:09:14.230 --> 05:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
of people absolutely um
 
05:09:14.240 --> 05:09:16.788 align:start position:0%
of people absolutely um
and

05:09:16.788 --> 05:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:19.510 --> 05:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
because most people it seemed like most
 
05:09:22.310 --> 05:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
people who who died of covet had
 
05:09:22.320 --> 05:09:24.628 align:start position:0%
people who who died of covet had
co-morbidities

05:09:24.628 --> 05:09:24.638 align:start position:0%
co-morbidities
 
05:09:26.948 --> 05:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
and what comes first the chicken or the
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
egg is it you know was it was a covert
 
05:09:30.868 --> 05:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
that pushed them over the top to pass
 
05:09:30.878 --> 05:09:31.830 align:start position:0%
that pushed them over the top to pass
away

05:09:31.830 --> 05:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
away
 
05:09:33.910 --> 05:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
or was there underlying cancer or heart
 
05:09:35.590 --> 05:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
disease or whatever it might be and that
 
05:09:37.350 --> 05:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
that but you were trying to explain
 
05:09:38.708 --> 05:09:38.718 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of a tree here that
 
05:09:41.590 --> 05:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
you yeah so absolutely so it would be
 
05:09:43.750 --> 05:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
sort of like if you had cancer and you
 
05:09:46.550 --> 05:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
died in a car accident so the cancer
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily cause the car
 
05:09:51.510 --> 05:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
accident that you died in but if you had
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know and i'm not a physician so but
 
05:09:55.750 --> 05:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
if you had some sort of underlying
 
05:09:58.230 --> 05:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
disorder because of that cancer or some
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
other condition that you know the car
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
accident led to that so the car accident
 
05:10:04.948 --> 05:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
still is is there and the cancer is the
 
05:10:07.990 --> 05:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
underlying you know component so you
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
know in the example that i just gave
 
05:10:11.350 --> 05:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
which was around pneumonia people say
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
well you died in pneumonia you didn't
 
05:10:15.910 --> 05:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
die of covet well the covid gave you the
 
05:10:18.150 --> 05:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
pneumonia now in terms of like a chronic
 
05:10:19.430 --> 05:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
disease which is what i think you're
 
05:10:21.190 --> 05:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
talking about like a heart disease or a
 
05:10:23.910 --> 05:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
diabetes again that person would have
 
05:10:26.628 --> 05:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
not likely died that day you know with
 
05:10:28.310 --> 05:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
just everything because
 
05:10:30.868 --> 05:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
without the commit so you know we all
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
many of us in this country and in this
 
05:10:34.150 --> 05:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
state and probably in this room all have
 
05:10:35.990 --> 05:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
some form of chronic disease we're
 
05:10:38.230 --> 05:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
likely not to pass away today from that
 
05:10:40.628 --> 05:10:40.638 align:start position:0%
but with the addition of covid that is
 
05:10:43.670 --> 05:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
what causes the death is that helpful uh
 
05:10:46.948 --> 05:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative mooney
 
05:10:48.550 --> 05:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:10:50.550 --> 05:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
being here and taking my question
 
05:10:52.868 --> 05:10:52.878 align:start position:0%
i see on this list of ten causes of
 
05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
death i don't see any drug related
 
05:10:59.430 --> 05:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
illegal drug related um
 
05:11:01.990 --> 05:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
overdoses right on there so i'm just
 
05:11:04.150 --> 05:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
curious where that fits in sure knowing
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
the problems new hampshire has and
 
05:11:07.670 --> 05:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
fentanyl making its way from the border
 
05:11:09.350 --> 05:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you very much for
 
05:11:10.868 --> 05:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
that question representative mooney that
 
05:11:12.550 --> 05:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
would actually be incorporated into
 
05:11:14.550 --> 05:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
accidents which are unintentional
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
injuries so it sometimes falls within
 
05:11:19.990 --> 05:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
that in fact in that case or you know
 
05:11:22.470 --> 05:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately in intentional self-harm
 
05:11:23.830 --> 05:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
so that's where you would find those
 
05:11:23.840 --> 05:11:25.030 align:start position:0%
so that's where you would find those
drug-related

05:11:25.030 --> 05:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
drug-related
 
05:11:28.910 --> 05:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:28.920 --> 05:11:30.788 align:start position:0%
 
representation

05:11:30.788 --> 05:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
representation
 
05:11:32.708 --> 05:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so the other thing
 
05:11:32.718 --> 05:11:33.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so the other thing
that

05:11:33.510 --> 05:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:11:34.628 --> 05:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
i don't know where it would be in this
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
list but i hear people joke about the
 
05:11:38.868 --> 05:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
flu is gone nobody ever dies with the
 
05:11:41.670 --> 05:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
flu anymore so is the flu
 
05:11:44.310 --> 05:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
in one of these categories
 
05:11:47.670 --> 05:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
um no it isn't so people still die of
 
05:11:49.990 --> 05:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
the flu it tends not to be in our top
 
05:11:53.350 --> 05:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
ten again of straight influenza now if
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
you have the chronic lower respiratory
 
05:11:58.708 --> 05:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
diseases that's typically like copd
 
05:12:01.350 --> 05:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
asthma again that's another example if
 
05:12:03.510 --> 05:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
you have copd and you have the flu those
 
05:12:05.430 --> 05:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
things go hand in hand together
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:12:07.920 --> 05:12:08.948 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
okay

05:12:08.948 --> 05:12:08.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:17.430 --> 05:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
so winter 2021
 
05:12:19.830 --> 05:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
was deadly for our older population i
 
05:12:21.830 --> 05:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
think we'll all remember the scare that
 
05:12:24.550 --> 05:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
we had with long-term care facilities
 
05:12:26.788 --> 05:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
you know the deaths were highest back
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
then in the 2020s which is where that
 
05:12:31.750 --> 05:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
first arrow is was for individuals age
 
05:12:33.670 --> 05:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
80 and older
 
05:12:36.310 --> 05:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines did not become available until
 
05:12:39.750 --> 05:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
late december 2020
 
05:12:41.830 --> 05:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me and did not become available
 
05:12:44.150 --> 05:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
for the public until january through
 
05:12:47.190 --> 05:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
march of 2021
 
05:12:49.270 --> 05:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
so you can see those dips right in there
 
05:12:51.750 --> 05:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't that first arrow there were no
 
05:12:54.150 --> 05:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines we started to get vaccines and
 
05:12:57.110 --> 05:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
the number went down the delta came back
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
however with a hard punch
 
05:13:02.788 --> 05:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
and those that were unvaccinated were at
 
05:13:05.350 --> 05:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
higher risk for hospitalization and
 
05:13:08.070 --> 05:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
death we saw our hospitals begin to
 
05:13:10.628 --> 05:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
reach their breaking point as delta
 
05:13:13.110 --> 05:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
swept through rural areas of the state
 
05:13:16.628 --> 05:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
and then was replaced with omicron
 
05:13:19.750 --> 05:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
omicron was even more transmissible and
 
05:13:21.830 --> 05:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
is still transmissible it is still what
 
05:13:23.910 --> 05:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
is circulating in the state but
 
05:13:26.788 --> 05:13:26.798 align:start position:0%
fortunately it was a little less severe
 
05:13:28.708 --> 05:13:28.718 align:start position:0%
than the delta variant
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
but the sheer number of cases that we've
 
05:13:33.190 --> 05:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
had meant that even though the
 
05:13:35.430 --> 05:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
proportion of people getting severely
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
ill was lower than delta or lower than
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
the strains before the number was higher
 
05:13:43.830 --> 05:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
and we now see that deaths are more
 
05:13:46.868 --> 05:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
likely to be those in their 60s rather
 
05:13:49.270 --> 05:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
than those in their 80s
 
05:13:51.350 --> 05:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
this is due in part to the very high
 
05:13:53.590 --> 05:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine vaccination rates among those
 
05:13:57.430 --> 05:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
age 70 and older lower vaccine uptake
 
05:14:00.310 --> 05:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
among those in their 50s and 60s has put
 
05:14:02.150 --> 05:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
them in higher risk
 
05:14:04.070 --> 05:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
and what our data doesn't show quite as
 
05:14:06.390 --> 05:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
clearly is again i think i mentioned
 
05:14:08.628 --> 05:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
earlier that the unh survey center found
 
05:14:10.470 --> 05:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
in january
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
they believe about 29 percent of
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
residents say they have tested positive
 
05:14:18.868 --> 05:14:18.878 align:start position:0%
for covid at least once
 
05:14:22.470 --> 05:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
let's move on to the next slide here
 
05:14:25.110 --> 05:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to vaccination
 
05:14:27.430 --> 05:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines have been at the center we have
 
05:14:29.430 --> 05:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
another question representative
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
05:14:32.788 --> 05:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
05:14:34.628 --> 05:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
what is this chart showing i can't find
 
05:14:35.990 --> 05:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
the key to it there's a blue line
 
05:14:37.750 --> 05:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's the grays is it all cases
 
05:14:39.430 --> 05:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
there's deaths in there too
 
05:14:41.190 --> 05:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question that is the
 
05:14:43.110 --> 05:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
blue line is the seven day average which
 
05:14:44.868 --> 05:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
just sort of rounds out the numbers so
 
05:14:46.708 --> 05:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
it's the seven day average of and the
 
05:14:48.550 --> 05:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
the gray are the individual case counts
 
05:14:50.310 --> 05:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
for that day so this is strictly cases
 
05:14:52.470 --> 05:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
not deaths yes these are cases thank you
 
05:14:59.430 --> 05:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:02.310 --> 05:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
all right i'll move on to vaccines as
 
05:15:04.628 --> 05:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
you've heard dr chan and others and the
 
05:15:06.788 --> 05:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
governors say vaccines have been the
 
05:15:10.230 --> 05:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
center of our covid19 response because
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
they are the best tool we have to
 
05:15:15.030 --> 05:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
prevent hospitalization and deaths
 
05:15:17.430 --> 05:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
covid19 vaccines are safe they're
 
05:15:20.230 --> 05:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
effective and they're free and more than
 
05:15:22.470 --> 05:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
two million doses of vaccine have been
 
05:15:24.230 --> 05:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
administered in new hampshire in the
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
past year
 
05:15:28.948 --> 05:15:28.958 align:start position:0%
um so i think i just sort of rest on
 
05:15:31.590 --> 05:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
that a little bit one year two million
 
05:15:33.110 --> 05:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
doses of
 
05:15:34.628 --> 05:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
two and about two and a half million
 
05:15:37.270 --> 05:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
doses of vaccine this is really an
 
05:15:40.390 --> 05:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
incredible achievement it is brought to
 
05:15:42.150 --> 05:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
the people by in new hampshire by
 
05:15:44.788 --> 05:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
doctors by nurses by pharmacists by the
 
05:15:47.350 --> 05:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
national guard our community and our
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
municipal volunteers our public health
 
05:15:52.550 --> 05:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
networks and the incredible team that we
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
have at dhhs
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
no one should ever question the
 
05:15:59.430 --> 05:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
dedication the hard work the sacrifice
 
05:16:01.030 --> 05:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
and the competence of all of these
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
people vaccine has saved countless lives
 
05:16:05.670 --> 05:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
05:16:08.070 --> 05:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
and soon vaccines will even be available
 
05:16:10.110 --> 05:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
for the youngest in the state it is
 
05:16:12.550 --> 05:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
anticipated that the data will be
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
brought to the fda and the cdc later
 
05:16:16.948 --> 05:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
this spring for approval for children
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
ages six months to four years old
 
05:16:21.510 --> 05:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
many families who have navigated the
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
tricky waters of child care and
 
05:16:27.030 --> 05:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
quarantine and loss of work and missed
 
05:16:29.110 --> 05:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
work in school are going to welcome the
 
05:16:32.788 --> 05:16:32.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to consider vaccination
 
05:16:36.150 --> 05:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
for their youngest children
 
05:16:36.160 --> 05:16:37.110 align:start position:0%
for their youngest children
so

05:16:37.110 --> 05:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
the other thing i will note as we look
 
05:16:39.990 --> 05:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
at these numbers i think it has been
 
05:16:41.590 --> 05:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
well known
 
05:16:43.350 --> 05:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
both in many of our legislative
 
05:16:45.190 --> 05:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
committees and certainly within the
 
05:16:48.310 --> 05:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
media we have had some difficulty in
 
05:16:50.310 --> 05:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
counting some of our cases of that of
 
05:16:52.708 --> 05:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine one of the things that we are
 
05:16:55.590 --> 05:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
very you know pretty darn sure about is
 
05:16:57.750 --> 05:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
this number of doses
 
05:16:59.670 --> 05:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
because we count each dose of those
 
05:17:02.070 --> 05:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines like they're gold we we track
 
05:17:03.990 --> 05:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
them we make sure we know where they are
 
05:17:06.150 --> 05:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
both at the state and the federal level
 
05:17:08.070 --> 05:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
what becomes tricky is actually the
 
05:17:10.708 --> 05:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
number of people who've received one two
 
05:17:13.990 --> 05:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
three or four doses and how they are um
 
05:17:16.150 --> 05:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
up to date or have had a booster and
 
05:17:18.470 --> 05:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
that simply because is because of the
 
05:17:19.990 --> 05:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
issues that we've had with our
 
05:17:23.350 --> 05:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
immunization information system our iis
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
and the opting in and the opting out
 
05:17:27.830 --> 05:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
process so while we can tell you the
 
05:17:29.270 --> 05:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
number of doses who have been
 
05:17:31.350 --> 05:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
administered there are some cases where
 
05:17:33.510 --> 05:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
we can't link that to a particular
 
05:17:35.750 --> 05:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
person within our current data system
 
05:17:37.590 --> 05:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
because of those opt-outs so i just want
 
05:17:39.190 --> 05:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
to be clear about that those two and a
 
05:17:41.110 --> 05:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
half million doses that's a number that
 
05:17:44.070 --> 05:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
we feel very confident about and
 
05:17:45.430 --> 05:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take questions about
 
05:17:49.270 --> 05:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
let me ask a question right now is
 
05:17:52.320 --> 05:17:53.910 align:start position:0%
let me ask a question right now is
uh

05:17:53.910 --> 05:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:17:55.990 --> 05:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
do you also keep track of the number of
 
05:17:58.150 --> 05:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
doses that get wasted
 
05:18:00.868 --> 05:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
yes we do we do keep track of that and
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
early in the vaccine delivery that was
 
05:18:05.590 --> 05:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
super important because we had so little
 
05:18:07.510 --> 05:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine and that's the reason you may
 
05:18:09.910 --> 05:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
remember it feels like a blur and some
 
05:18:11.830 --> 05:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
of us have ptsd and have blocked this
 
05:18:11.840 --> 05:18:12.628 align:start position:0%
of us have ptsd and have blocked this
out

05:18:12.628 --> 05:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:18:15.190 --> 05:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
but we were dosing out so you'll
 
05:18:17.430 --> 05:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
remember you know those 70 and older
 
05:18:19.350 --> 05:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
started with vaccine and then we started
 
05:18:21.590 --> 05:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
letting in groups we had 1a and 2 would
 
05:18:23.830 --> 05:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
be and all these groups that came in and
 
05:18:25.430 --> 05:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's because we didn't have enough
 
05:18:27.750 --> 05:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine at the time now that production
 
05:18:29.910 --> 05:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
is up and running we have more than
 
05:18:32.868 --> 05:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
enough vaccine but we still keep track
 
05:18:35.270 --> 05:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
of wastage
 
05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:40.310 --> 05:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
all right so vaccine distribution that
 
05:18:41.750 --> 05:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
was one of the questions that you asked
 
05:18:43.670 --> 05:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
us about again it's about two and a half
 
05:18:45.830 --> 05:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
million doses
 
05:18:48.150 --> 05:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
and you know i want to reiterate that
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of granite staters
 
05:18:52.150 --> 05:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
have the protection of this vaccine
 
05:18:54.868 --> 05:18:54.878 align:start position:0%
because of community partnerships we
 
05:18:56.948 --> 05:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
have distributed vaccine at the new
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire motor speedway and inside
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
people's homes we've done it in retail
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacies through our regional public
 
05:19:05.910 --> 05:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
health networks within communities our
 
05:19:07.830 --> 05:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
health care providers you know the
 
05:19:10.230 --> 05:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
national guard have the honor of putting
 
05:19:12.788 --> 05:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
the most shots in arms
 
05:19:14.788 --> 05:19:14.798 align:start position:0%
throughout this pandemic and again you
 
05:19:16.948 --> 05:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
may recall those times and perhaps some
 
05:19:19.670 --> 05:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
of you took part in those and early
 
05:19:21.830 --> 05:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine days where you drove up and they
 
05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
popped you a vaccine in your arm or you
 
05:19:25.910 --> 05:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
know eventually you got to go into like
 
05:19:28.708 --> 05:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
the old sears in concord and it was a
 
05:19:30.868 --> 05:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
monumental task and we could not have
 
05:19:32.470 --> 05:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
done it without the partnership of the
 
05:19:34.230 --> 05:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
guard and the guardsmen and women who
 
05:19:36.070 --> 05:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
were just extraordinary through this
 
05:19:36.080 --> 05:19:37.670 align:start position:0%
were just extraordinary through this
process

05:19:37.670 --> 05:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:19:37.680 --> 05:19:38.470 align:start position:0%
process
so

05:19:38.470 --> 05:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:19:41.350 --> 05:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
as we go through we have also
 
05:19:43.670 --> 05:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
put vans on the road and we brought
 
05:19:46.230 --> 05:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine to workplaces and to people's
 
05:19:48.070 --> 05:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
homes when they were too fragile to
 
05:19:48.080 --> 05:19:48.868 align:start position:0%
homes when they were too fragile to
leave

05:19:48.868 --> 05:19:48.878 align:start position:0%
leave
 
05:19:51.510 --> 05:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
over 5 000 doses have been administered
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
on-site at workplaces from deca to the
 
05:19:56.470 --> 05:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
shipyards in portsmouth
 
05:19:58.550 --> 05:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
we have tried to make it as easy as
 
05:20:01.990 --> 05:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
possible for people to get vaccine when
 
05:20:04.550 --> 05:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
and what when they want it when and
 
05:20:06.550 --> 05:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
where we've tried to accommodate work
 
05:20:08.788 --> 05:20:08.798 align:start position:0%
schedules and people who work you know
 
05:20:11.670 --> 05:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
different shift works um we have an
 
05:20:14.948 --> 05:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
entire team that takes invitations from
 
05:20:17.910 --> 05:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
workplaces communities churches who say
 
05:20:21.270 --> 05:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
could you bring the van out to us for in
 
05:20:23.430 --> 05:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
the early part for those early doses or
 
05:20:25.350 --> 05:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
for a booster now and we still have
 
05:20:26.708 --> 05:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
those vans going out throughout the
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
community now always at the invitation
 
05:20:33.110 --> 05:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
of a community an organization or a
 
05:20:33.120 --> 05:20:37.030 align:start position:0%
of a community an organization or a
workplace

05:20:37.030 --> 05:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:38.708 --> 05:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
so what else have we done to support
 
05:20:40.550 --> 05:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
businesses and you know as your
 
05:20:42.708 --> 05:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
communities know best of all
 
05:20:45.190 --> 05:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
you know our businesses have navigated
 
05:20:47.830 --> 05:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
these complexities of the pandemic and
 
05:20:49.830 --> 05:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
and have had the support of the cares
 
05:20:51.430 --> 05:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
act and go for in the paycheck
 
05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
protection plan and mostly have come out
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
on the other side
 
05:20:58.470 --> 05:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
but early in the pandemic the governor's
 
05:21:00.788 --> 05:21:00.798 align:start position:0%
reopening task force met daily to
 
05:21:03.350 --> 05:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
provide feedback to public health and to
 
05:21:06.070 --> 05:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
develop those universal best practices
 
05:21:10.390 --> 05:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
we had over 2 000 clusters or outbreaks
 
05:21:13.190 --> 05:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
in settings where people work play learn
 
05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
and relax
 
05:21:16.788 --> 05:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
there is not a business community that
 
05:21:19.270 --> 05:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
hasn't been affected by sick workers
 
05:21:23.190 --> 05:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
staff and and quarantine
 
05:21:25.430 --> 05:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
the again that granite state poll
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
recently noted that most granite staters
 
05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
now are comfortable going to hair salons
 
05:21:33.590 --> 05:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
and restaurants and fewer than half are
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
really ready for big large group of
 
05:21:39.510 --> 05:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
events like concerts or big weddings
 
05:21:41.990 --> 05:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
but now with vaccine and therapeutics
 
05:21:44.550 --> 05:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
easily available and people can feel
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
comfortable making their own decisions
 
05:21:49.670 --> 05:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
to protect themselves and to protect
 
05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
their businesses
 
05:21:53.430 --> 05:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
from a public health perspective
 
05:21:56.310 --> 05:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
and because we now have a high level of
 
05:21:59.910 --> 05:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
infection or vaccine induced immunity
 
05:22:02.230 --> 05:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
safe and affected testing and vaccines
 
05:22:05.590 --> 05:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
and therapeutics it is fine to ease up
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
on those restrictions that we all felt
 
05:22:10.310 --> 05:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
early in the pandemic you know we no
 
05:22:13.430 --> 05:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
longer engage in universal case
 
05:22:16.310 --> 05:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
investigation or contact tracing cdc
 
05:22:18.470 --> 05:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
also agrees that that's no longer
 
05:22:21.510 --> 05:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
recommended for covid19 we no longer get
 
05:22:23.990 --> 05:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
daily reports from our schools this was
 
05:22:27.030 --> 05:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
a huge relief to our school nurses
 
05:22:29.670 --> 05:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
who were doing an incredible job again i
 
05:22:31.270 --> 05:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
talk about the national guard of being
 
05:22:33.270 --> 05:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
the heroes of this pandemic our school
 
05:22:35.190 --> 05:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
nurses are really the heroes of this
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic as well they have undergone
 
05:22:39.990 --> 05:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
incredible burdens so we no longer take
 
05:22:42.150 --> 05:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
those daily reports
 
05:22:44.708 --> 05:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
we do prioritize and help specific
 
05:22:46.310 --> 05:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
settings or groups that are increased
 
05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
risk if there's an outbreak in a nursing
 
05:22:51.430 --> 05:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
home a school or a prison so we're
 
05:22:53.190 --> 05:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
always there to help individuals
 
05:22:54.948 --> 05:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
especially in those congregate settings
 
05:22:56.788 --> 05:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
that are more at risk we're there we
 
05:22:58.868 --> 05:22:58.878 align:start position:0%
still have a team but we're not doing
 
05:23:00.788 --> 05:23:00.798 align:start position:0%
the routine
 
05:23:03.270 --> 05:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
case investigation or that contact
 
05:23:04.948 --> 05:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
tracing that you might remember from
 
05:23:08.550 --> 05:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:11.510 --> 05:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
so here's you know there's far more
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
optimism today than there was two years
 
05:23:17.190 --> 05:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
ago we've come through some dark days
 
05:23:21.030 --> 05:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
but our community risk is decreasing
 
05:23:23.750 --> 05:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
omicron is in sharp decline
 
05:23:25.670 --> 05:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals are no longer bursting at the
 
05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
seams and soon even our youngest
 
05:23:30.390 --> 05:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
residents will be able to have the added
 
05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
protection that comes with vaccine
 
05:23:35.670 --> 05:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
not on this slide
 
05:23:37.750 --> 05:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
is the other strategy that will help us
 
05:23:39.670 --> 05:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
through the trajectory of the pandemic
 
05:23:43.110 --> 05:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
which is the widespread availability of
 
05:23:46.708 --> 05:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
therapeutic drugs to treat covid19
 
05:23:49.830 --> 05:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
paxlovid the name of a medication is
 
05:23:52.470 --> 05:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
effective against developing severe
 
05:23:55.750 --> 05:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
illness and it reduces hospitalization
 
05:23:58.390 --> 05:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
it works by stopping the virus from
 
05:24:00.948 --> 05:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
replicating and it remains in the body
 
05:24:02.868 --> 05:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
without breaking down for a longer
 
05:24:04.550 --> 05:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
period than some other previous
 
05:24:04.560 --> 05:24:05.750 align:start position:0%
period than some other previous
treatments

05:24:05.750 --> 05:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
treatments
 
05:24:08.470 --> 05:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
this is a major milestone for us the
 
05:24:10.390 --> 05:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
president recently announced that there
 
05:24:12.788 --> 05:24:12.798 align:start position:0%
will be a new federal test to treat
 
05:24:12.798 --> 05:24:14.070 align:start position:0%
will be a new federal test to treat
program

05:24:14.070 --> 05:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
that will be starting within the next
 
05:24:18.150 --> 05:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
week or so and this is working directly
 
05:24:20.708 --> 05:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
with our retail pharmacies they will
 
05:24:23.670 --> 05:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
have a cachet of effective antiviral
 
05:24:27.030 --> 05:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
drugs making easy access in every corner
 
05:24:28.948 --> 05:24:28.958 align:start position:0%
of the state and quite frankly the
 
05:24:28.958 --> 05:24:30.150 align:start position:0%
of the state and quite frankly the
country

05:24:30.150 --> 05:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:24:32.708 --> 05:24:32.718 align:start position:0%
when an individual gets tested at one of
 
05:24:35.270 --> 05:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
those like cvs urgent care centers they
 
05:24:37.270 --> 05:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
go in they get swabbed or they get
 
05:24:39.430 --> 05:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
swabbed out in the parking lot if it
 
05:24:42.230 --> 05:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
comes back positive if they're using an
 
05:24:45.350 --> 05:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
antigen test you can be sort of moved
 
05:24:47.430 --> 05:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
right over to the pharmacy component to
 
05:24:49.830 --> 05:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
get access to the therapeutics that's
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
the notion is we want to be able to test
 
05:24:54.868 --> 05:24:54.878 align:start position:0%
and treat as soon as possible for those
 
05:24:56.470 --> 05:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
getting their care in their health care
 
05:24:58.550 --> 05:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
providers or other places there will
 
05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
also be and we currently have those
 
05:25:02.628 --> 05:25:02.638 align:start position:0%
therapeutics available in those
 
05:25:04.470 --> 05:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
environments and you would certainly be
 
05:25:06.708 --> 05:25:06.718 align:start position:0%
able to get therapeutics by prescription
 
05:25:08.628 --> 05:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
if you're you went to your family doctor
 
05:25:11.110 --> 05:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
you could go and get a therapeutics very
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
quickly this is again a big game changer
 
05:25:17.270 --> 05:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
because it really will continue to limit
 
05:25:19.430 --> 05:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
the number of people that get so
 
05:25:21.750 --> 05:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
severely ill that they need to end up in
 
05:25:24.070 --> 05:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
the hospital we understand kovit is
 
05:25:26.788 --> 05:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
going to be around for a good time you
 
05:25:28.708 --> 05:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
know we still have cases we're in sharp
 
05:25:31.030 --> 05:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
decline we're no longer at 5000 cases a
 
05:25:33.590 --> 05:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
day we're down to you know under 200
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
cases a day but our goal at this point
 
05:25:38.788 --> 05:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that there's testing
 
05:25:41.030 --> 05:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
availability testing available it's a
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
reason you can get your your antigen
 
05:25:44.470 --> 05:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
test at the liquor store right now we
 
05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
want to make that easy so you know when
 
05:25:48.788 --> 05:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
you're positive and then as soon as you
 
05:25:50.070 --> 05:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
know when you're positive you have
 
05:25:52.070 --> 05:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
access to therapeutics it's sort of like
 
05:25:54.868 --> 05:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
tamiflu for the flu it can if you get it
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
early it really can help we have another
 
05:25:59.750 --> 05:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
question representative rodney thank you
 
05:26:01.670 --> 05:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you thank you
 
05:26:03.910 --> 05:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
additional question the second mystery
 
05:26:05.910 --> 05:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
of covert for me
 
05:26:05.920 --> 05:26:07.030 align:start position:0%
of covert for me
is

05:26:07.030 --> 05:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:26:09.110 --> 05:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
it seems like not all tests were created
 
05:26:09.120 --> 05:26:11.030 align:start position:0%
it seems like not all tests were created
equal

05:26:11.030 --> 05:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
equal
 
05:26:12.708 --> 05:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
i i know so many people who say they
 
05:26:14.550 --> 05:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
were tested in the morning positive but
 
05:26:16.150 --> 05:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
then had a second test in the afternoon
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
and was negative
 
05:26:21.350 --> 05:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
was that because of the type of test and
 
05:26:23.190 --> 05:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
i think we've probably learned a lot
 
05:26:24.948 --> 05:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
over the last year
 
05:26:26.628 --> 05:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
about certain tests not being that
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
accurate is am i telling an untruth here
 
05:26:31.590 --> 05:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
or is that true
 
05:26:33.750 --> 05:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
um i think it's part of the truth um
 
05:26:35.510 --> 05:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's my good bureaucratic answer right
 
05:26:37.910 --> 05:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
there so you know again we stood up
 
05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
those tests pretty quickly we've always
 
05:26:41.110 --> 05:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
known that pcr tests are the gold
 
05:26:42.788 --> 05:26:42.798 align:start position:0%
standard and that's what we started with
 
05:26:44.310 --> 05:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
and that's where you send it out to a
 
05:26:46.310 --> 05:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
lab the lab does its magic with it and
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
it comes up with a an answer antigen
 
05:26:50.708 --> 05:26:50.718 align:start position:0%
tests those over-the-counter tests or
 
05:26:52.390 --> 05:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
the antigen tests that even take place
 
05:26:55.430 --> 05:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
in a doctor's office are less accurate
 
05:26:57.190 --> 05:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
they're still pretty darn accurate but
 
05:26:59.270 --> 05:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
they're certainly less accurate the
 
05:27:01.590 --> 05:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
other component with those those at-home
 
05:27:04.390 --> 05:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
tests and the antigen tests really it
 
05:27:06.550 --> 05:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
you need to be shedding virus pretty
 
05:27:09.030 --> 05:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
actively so in some cases i'll use an
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
example that you told me for early in
 
05:27:12.470 --> 05:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
the morning you test positive in the
 
05:27:14.550 --> 05:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
afternoon you test negative you know
 
05:27:16.470 --> 05:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
that could also be because you might be
 
05:27:19.030 --> 05:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
shedding less virus but you know i think
 
05:27:21.510 --> 05:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
we've all heard about those cases where
 
05:27:23.590 --> 05:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
that might be you know there may be some
 
05:27:23.600 --> 05:27:24.470 align:start position:0%
that might be you know there may be some
question

05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
but for the most part we know um through
 
05:27:30.470 --> 05:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
again follow-up by pcr tests which
 
05:27:32.548 --> 05:27:32.558 align:start position:0%
really are the gold standard that those
 
05:27:34.628 --> 05:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
cases have been out there and you know
 
05:27:37.190 --> 05:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
we had this high peak of omicron i don't
 
05:27:38.868 --> 05:27:38.878 align:start position:0%
think it was the ta the tests that were
 
05:27:40.390 --> 05:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
telling us that we certainly knew that
 
05:27:43.350 --> 05:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
that was um in the in the community and
 
05:27:45.670 --> 05:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
in fact speaking of tests it's one of
 
05:27:47.190 --> 05:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
the reasons that we're no longer
 
05:27:49.990 --> 05:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
accepting and um those at-home tests
 
05:27:51.270 --> 05:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
that was actually part of what was
 
05:27:52.628 --> 05:27:52.638 align:start position:0%
really hard for school nurses they were
 
05:27:54.470 --> 05:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
trying to report back to us every time
 
05:27:56.868 --> 05:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
johnny came in with an at-home test they
 
05:27:58.788 --> 05:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
were required to report that to us we've
 
05:28:01.510 --> 05:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
sort of taken that away and the the
 
05:28:03.510 --> 05:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
count that we use today are the tests
 
05:28:05.110 --> 05:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
that come to us through electronic lab
 
05:28:07.670 --> 05:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
reporting which are the most likely the
 
05:28:10.070 --> 05:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
pcr tests that occur in the lab is that
 
05:28:12.948 --> 05:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
helpful yes uh one follow-up though um
 
05:28:14.470 --> 05:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
so in the program you were just talking
 
05:28:16.070 --> 05:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
about the therapeutics
 
05:28:18.310 --> 05:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
you get swabbed it's positive you go
 
05:28:19.750 --> 05:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
right in you get the therapeutics is
 
05:28:22.150 --> 05:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
that going to be the pcr test um i think
 
05:28:24.788 --> 05:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
it will be probably a mix of tests um i
 
05:28:26.628 --> 05:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
think you know we will continue to
 
05:28:28.628 --> 05:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
monitor i mean all of with all of these
 
05:28:30.150 --> 05:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
drugs we'll continue to monitor we've
 
05:28:32.310 --> 05:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
been sending out lots of support
 
05:28:34.868 --> 05:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
to our healthcare physicians as the data
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
comes in on the effectiveness i think
 
05:28:39.190 --> 05:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
many people noted in the media there was
 
05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
an earlier um therapeutic drug that was
 
05:28:44.788 --> 05:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
not good for omicron paxlovit is the one
 
05:28:47.830 --> 05:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's good for omicron so we are we are
 
05:28:50.708 --> 05:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
learning the science in real time um but
 
05:28:53.350 --> 05:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
i think the the um
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
the risk benefit is greater of making
 
05:28:58.070 --> 05:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
sure instead of saying oh i don't know
 
05:28:59.590 --> 05:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
if that's really positive i'm not going
 
05:29:01.510 --> 05:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
to take that therapeutic you know i
 
05:29:03.510 --> 05:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
think the risk benefit is it's probably
 
05:29:05.990 --> 05:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
better to take it and be sure that you
 
05:29:08.390 --> 05:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
won't have a severe outcome and
 
05:29:10.310 --> 05:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
especially as you were noting we have so
 
05:29:12.430 --> 05:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
many people that with those precondit
 
05:29:14.470 --> 05:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
pre-existing conditions that can put
 
05:29:16.310 --> 05:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
them at higher risk if you had heart
 
05:29:18.310 --> 05:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
disease and you tested positive on an
 
05:29:19.910 --> 05:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
at-home test you should probably take
 
05:29:21.510 --> 05:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
the therapy clinic thank you appreciate
 
05:29:21.520 --> 05:29:24.230 align:start position:0%
the therapy clinic thank you appreciate
that

05:29:24.230 --> 05:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:28.868 --> 05:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:31.190 --> 05:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
so representative element has a question
 
05:29:33.270 --> 05:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry sorry
 
05:29:33.280 --> 05:29:34.868 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry sorry
on

05:29:34.868 --> 05:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:29:34.878 --> 05:29:36.150 align:start position:0%
on
i'd

05:29:36.150 --> 05:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
i'd
 
05:29:39.350 --> 05:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
i've seen in various places including
 
05:29:40.708 --> 05:29:40.718 align:start position:0%
from a
 
05:29:43.590 --> 05:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
internet group in dc that a friend of
 
05:29:43.600 --> 05:29:45.830 align:start position:0%
internet group in dc that a friend of
mine

05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
mine
 
05:29:50.150 --> 05:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
got into a number about a year ago
 
05:29:53.430 --> 05:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:55.910 --> 05:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
the tests
 
05:29:55.920 --> 05:29:56.708 align:start position:0%
the tests
on

05:29:56.708 --> 05:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:29:58.948 --> 05:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
the at-home tests
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
that are sent to us in the mail
 
05:30:05.670 --> 05:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
if they sit in our mailboxes for hours
 
05:30:08.070 --> 05:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
when the temperature outside is 20
 
05:30:08.080 --> 05:30:09.110 align:start position:0%
when the temperature outside is 20
degrees

05:30:09.110 --> 05:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
degrees
 
05:30:12.548 --> 05:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:14.310 --> 05:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question we certainly
 
05:30:15.990 --> 05:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
know that those tests were never meant
 
05:30:18.628 --> 05:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
to sit out in harsh weather um you know
 
05:30:21.270 --> 05:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
we're still finding it it's imperfect
 
05:30:23.430 --> 05:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
and which is again why we say those pcr
 
05:30:25.350 --> 05:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
tests are the gold standard you know if
 
05:30:28.070 --> 05:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
you have symptoms of covid19 and they're
 
05:30:30.230 --> 05:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
not resolving and you have an at-home
 
05:30:32.150 --> 05:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
test and it says that you're you're
 
05:30:34.548 --> 05:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
negative you should probably go to your
 
05:30:37.590 --> 05:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
physician and have a pcr test done
 
05:30:39.670 --> 05:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:30:39.680 --> 05:30:41.910 align:start position:0%
thank you
ames

05:30:41.910 --> 05:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
ames
 
05:30:43.670 --> 05:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:30:45.830 --> 05:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
one of our guests earlier today
 
05:30:48.150 --> 05:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
who was talking to us about
 
05:30:48.160 --> 05:30:49.990 align:start position:0%
who was talking to us about
revenues

05:30:49.990 --> 05:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
05:30:51.830 --> 05:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
and in particular revenues from the
 
05:30:53.670 --> 05:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax
 
05:30:57.510 --> 05:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
suggested that uh we should anticipate
 
05:30:59.670 --> 05:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
quoting larger than normal seasonal
 
05:31:02.310 --> 05:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
swings due to rising cases he's talking
 
05:31:03.510 --> 05:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
about covid
 
05:31:05.430 --> 05:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
in the fall early winter so this
 
05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
seasonal swing
 
05:31:10.390 --> 05:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh idea what's your response to that
 
05:31:12.070 --> 05:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
05:31:14.390 --> 05:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
we agree you know i think if you even if
 
05:31:17.110 --> 05:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
i you know excuse me as i swing back
 
05:31:17.120 --> 05:31:18.070 align:start position:0%
i you know excuse me as i swing back
here

05:31:18.070 --> 05:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:31:21.270 --> 05:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
um if you look at those those bumps
 
05:31:24.150 --> 05:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
those bumps occurred in the winter
 
05:31:26.868 --> 05:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
and we will continue to probably see the
 
05:31:29.750 --> 05:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
seasonality of covet you know our hope
 
05:31:32.070 --> 05:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
again with testing with vaccine with
 
05:31:34.390 --> 05:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutics is we can mitigate the
 
05:31:37.350 --> 05:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
impact of severe disease we anticipate
 
05:31:39.510 --> 05:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
that we'll continue to see some as the
 
05:31:41.430 --> 05:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
variants change i didn't talk too much
 
05:31:43.670 --> 05:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
about this but you know we actively
 
05:31:46.150 --> 05:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
monitor here in new hampshire as well as
 
05:31:47.910 --> 05:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
you know nationally
 
05:31:50.070 --> 05:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
what the variants are over time and each
 
05:31:51.830 --> 05:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the variants as we all learned with
 
05:31:54.310 --> 05:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
delta and omicron
 
05:31:55.750 --> 05:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
are slightly different some are more
 
05:31:55.760 --> 05:31:57.110 align:start position:0%
are slightly different some are more
transmissible

05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
transmissible
 
05:31:59.670 --> 05:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
less severe some are more severe less
 
05:31:59.680 --> 05:32:01.910 align:start position:0%
less severe some are more severe less
transmissional

05:32:01.910 --> 05:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
transmissional
 
05:32:03.030 --> 05:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:32:05.270 --> 05:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
great so as you can see
 
05:32:07.350 --> 05:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
our pandemic response has changed over
 
05:32:09.270 --> 05:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
time you know we started in the
 
05:32:12.310 --> 05:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
beginning everything shut down we had no
 
05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
supplies um people were at real risk we
 
05:32:17.590 --> 05:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
saw that in that first winter when you
 
05:32:18.948 --> 05:32:18.958 align:start position:0%
know um
 
05:32:21.030 --> 05:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
covid ran through our long-term care
 
05:32:23.110 --> 05:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
facilities and we lost so many of our
 
05:32:26.470 --> 05:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
community members um at that time and so
 
05:32:28.548 --> 05:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
the strategies that we put in place
 
05:32:31.510 --> 05:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
change over time so now we have we start
 
05:32:34.470 --> 05:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
with sort of that everyone closed down
 
05:32:37.110 --> 05:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
we we created some mitigation measures
 
05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
those were those universal best
 
05:32:41.270 --> 05:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
practices that we gave to businesses and
 
05:32:43.670 --> 05:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
other infectious infection control
 
05:32:46.230 --> 05:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
practices and then you sort of move
 
05:32:48.548 --> 05:32:48.558 align:start position:0%
through this continuum to when you have
 
05:32:51.030 --> 05:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine and therapeutics and so that's
 
05:32:53.030 --> 05:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
where we are right now
 
05:32:55.670 --> 05:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
um it's we're not over but it certainly
 
05:32:58.230 --> 05:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
is going to help us get to a place that
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
feels a little more normal for all of us
 
05:33:03.590 --> 05:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
so in all of this time
 
05:33:06.868 --> 05:33:06.878 align:start position:0%
we have had this hard balance of
 
05:33:10.230 --> 05:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
competing priorities um you know we have
 
05:33:13.430 --> 05:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
the covid19 control and mitigation
 
05:33:13.440 --> 05:33:14.390 align:start position:0%
the covid19 control and mitigation
versus

05:33:14.390 --> 05:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
versus
 
05:33:16.470 --> 05:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
our mental health our emotional health
 
05:33:18.868 --> 05:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
our economy those things have been the
 
05:33:21.270 --> 05:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
balance over the past two years and what
 
05:33:23.430 --> 05:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
i think we're starting to see right now
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
is a tip from this graphic where those
 
05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
issues around the economy and children's
 
05:33:30.470 --> 05:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
mental health are tipping in the
 
05:33:34.310 --> 05:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
direction because we have the vaccines
 
05:33:36.628 --> 05:33:36.638 align:start position:0%
the therapeutics and the easy
 
05:33:39.670 --> 05:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
access to testing that we didn't have
 
05:33:40.830 --> 05:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
two years
 
05:33:40.840 --> 05:33:42.548 align:start position:0%
two years
ago

05:33:42.548 --> 05:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
ago
 
05:33:44.150 --> 05:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
and so we're not the only ones seeing
 
05:33:46.948 --> 05:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
this the cdc has also acknowledged this
 
05:33:48.150 --> 05:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
and so they
 
05:33:51.670 --> 05:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
realize we're in a new stage and so
 
05:33:53.590 --> 05:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
like we are in new hampshire right now
 
05:33:55.750 --> 05:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
which is really monitoring severe
 
05:33:58.310 --> 05:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
illness and hospitalization
 
05:34:01.990 --> 05:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
the cdc has put together a new way to
 
05:34:05.110 --> 05:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
monitor community risk and that is by
 
05:34:06.948 --> 05:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
really looking aiming at those
 
05:34:10.150 --> 05:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
hospitalization numbers as well as the
 
05:34:12.310 --> 05:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
coveted case numbers so this was just
 
05:34:14.948 --> 05:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
announced last week there's a map on the
 
05:34:17.830 --> 05:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
cdc website that goes county by county
 
05:34:20.628 --> 05:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
and takes this math into consideration
 
05:34:23.110 --> 05:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
and labels each county as
 
05:34:26.470 --> 05:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
red yellow or green or high medium and
 
05:34:29.190 --> 05:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
low i'm very happy to say that as of
 
05:34:31.750 --> 05:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
this morning every state every
 
05:34:34.548 --> 05:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
county in new hampshire is either low or
 
05:34:34.558 --> 05:34:35.750 align:start position:0%
county in new hampshire is either low or
medium

05:34:35.750 --> 05:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
medium
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
according to this new framework
 
05:34:40.708 --> 05:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
hillsboro rockingham and belknap are the
 
05:34:43.190 --> 05:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
ones that are at low the rest are all at
 
05:34:46.310 --> 05:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
medium risk and this is great news
 
05:34:48.708 --> 05:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
that leads us to the other news that i
 
05:34:51.110 --> 05:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
think many people applauded recently is
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
our current face mass recommendation
 
05:34:55.430 --> 05:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
which simply states that with the
 
05:34:57.510 --> 05:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
decreasing incidence and the continued
 
05:35:00.628 --> 05:35:00.638 align:start position:0%
decrease in related hospitalizations
 
05:35:03.910 --> 05:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
public health is no longer recommending
 
05:35:06.470 --> 05:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
universal masking and you know i i sort
 
05:35:08.230 --> 05:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
of took a moment myself even when i
 
05:35:09.430 --> 05:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
walked in this building this is the
 
05:35:10.868 --> 05:35:10.878 align:start position:0%
first time i've been in this building in
 
05:35:13.110 --> 05:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
two years without a mask on
 
05:35:14.310 --> 05:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:35:16.470 --> 05:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that individuals
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
know that universe we're no longer
 
05:35:21.350 --> 05:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
recommending that universal masking but
 
05:35:23.590 --> 05:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
that individually you may have
 
05:35:25.430 --> 05:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
considerations that make you want to
 
05:35:28.150 --> 05:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
choose to wear a mask and we want to
 
05:35:30.628 --> 05:35:30.638 align:start position:0%
ensure that people feel welcome and that
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
they do that because they may have their
 
05:35:35.430 --> 05:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
own personal risk they may have an
 
05:35:35.440 --> 05:35:36.470 align:start position:0%
own personal risk they may have an
additional

05:35:36.470 --> 05:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
additional
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
health condition there may be someone at
 
05:35:40.868 --> 05:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
home who's on chemotherapy there are all
 
05:35:43.270 --> 05:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
sorts of reasons why people may choose
 
05:35:45.510 --> 05:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
to continue to wear a risk that are very
 
05:35:47.830 --> 05:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
val wear a mask
 
05:35:50.470 --> 05:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
that are very valid and but we want to
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that people know that that's
 
05:35:53.590 --> 05:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
where we are right now is that we're
 
05:35:56.150 --> 05:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
assessing our own personal risk and
 
05:35:58.390 --> 05:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
making the decisions that are best for
 
05:35:58.400 --> 05:35:59.110 align:start position:0%
making the decisions that are best for
us

05:35:59.110 --> 05:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
us
 
05:36:00.788 --> 05:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
there are a couple caveats though
 
05:36:02.548 --> 05:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
there's always an asterisk
 
05:36:05.270 --> 05:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
of which is if um
 
05:36:08.070 --> 05:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
the current cdc guidance currently still
 
05:36:11.110 --> 05:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
says if you have covet 19 you stay home
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
and isolate for five days you can come
 
05:36:15.510 --> 05:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
back out if you're feeling well but it
 
05:36:18.070 --> 05:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
does ask and require that you wear a
 
05:36:20.070 --> 05:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
mask for those next five days till you
 
05:36:22.390 --> 05:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
get to 10 days so that's one place where
 
05:36:24.310 --> 05:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
we're really strongly recommending
 
05:36:26.070 --> 05:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
people follow that because we don't want
 
05:36:33.430 --> 05:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:34.868 --> 05:36:34.878 align:start position:0%
so here we are
 
05:36:36.948 --> 05:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
we're gonna continue with our other
 
05:36:39.430 --> 05:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
prevention and mitigation strategies uh
 
05:36:40.948 --> 05:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
we want everybody to still wash your
 
05:36:42.948 --> 05:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
hands you know i was hoping people wash
 
05:36:44.548 --> 05:36:44.558 align:start position:0%
their hands before the pandemic i kind
 
05:36:47.590 --> 05:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
of hope they still wash their hands now
 
05:36:49.030 --> 05:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure you test when you
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
have symptoms and you follow those
 
05:36:53.670 --> 05:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
isolation and quarantine guidelines so
 
05:36:56.070 --> 05:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
as not to make others sick and to put
 
05:36:59.190 --> 05:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
others at risk
 
05:37:02.548 --> 05:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
on the horizon we've got some new ways
 
05:37:05.590 --> 05:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
to think about covet 19 and community
 
05:37:08.708 --> 05:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
spread and monitoring the data and one
 
05:37:11.590 --> 05:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
of these that i think is really exciting
 
05:37:14.390 --> 05:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
is the surveillance of wastewater
 
05:37:16.390 --> 05:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
colleges a couple of towns in new
 
05:37:19.190 --> 05:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire are already doing this
 
05:37:21.670 --> 05:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
dhhs already has a contract with the
 
05:37:23.670 --> 05:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire who monitors
 
05:37:26.708 --> 05:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
the wastewater at new hampshire hospital
 
05:37:29.910 --> 05:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
and this is a cost-effective tool that
 
05:37:32.708 --> 05:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
really complements individual testing of
 
05:37:35.110 --> 05:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
individuals so you can get a you know
 
05:37:37.110 --> 05:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
get into that wastewater get into that
 
05:37:39.270 --> 05:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
sewage and pull that out and actually do
 
05:37:42.548 --> 05:37:42.558 align:start position:0%
a pcr test and it can tell you if
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's covid19 and the degree of coven
 
05:37:48.628 --> 05:37:48.638 align:start position:0%
19 in that wastewater so it really is
 
05:37:51.110 --> 05:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
sort of like just a signal it's a canary
 
05:37:53.110 --> 05:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
in the coal mine it's telling you that
 
05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
even before maybe individuals have
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
tested that there's some covid19
 
05:38:00.628 --> 05:38:00.638 align:start position:0%
circulating out in the community um many
 
05:38:02.390 --> 05:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
of us are pretty excited about this
 
05:38:03.990 --> 05:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
right now i'm excited to be talking
 
05:38:05.270 --> 05:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
about sewage
 
05:38:08.070 --> 05:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
we're working with des
 
05:38:10.470 --> 05:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
and exploring how we might expand this
 
05:38:13.190 --> 05:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
data especially as we see the numbers go
 
05:38:16.310 --> 05:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
down but we get ready for those upswings
 
05:38:22.390 --> 05:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:24.948 --> 05:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
so covet's not going away yet and we're
 
05:38:27.190 --> 05:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
going to continue to have risk we still
 
05:38:29.590 --> 05:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
have 150-ish people a day testing
 
05:38:29.600 --> 05:38:30.708 align:start position:0%
have 150-ish people a day testing
positive

05:38:30.708 --> 05:38:30.718 align:start position:0%
positive
 
05:38:33.270 --> 05:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
but we have reasonable and sustainable
 
05:38:35.750 --> 05:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
approaches on how to manage it those
 
05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
approaches are not free this is ways and
 
05:38:39.590 --> 05:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
means and finance i know you're
 
05:38:41.510 --> 05:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about the money it takes
 
05:38:43.910 --> 05:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
resources and it takes our community
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
partners to make it all work it's really
 
05:38:49.350 --> 05:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
been an extraordinary two years
 
05:38:53.030 --> 05:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
businesses the public have all endured
 
05:38:55.030 --> 05:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
so much sacrifice
 
05:38:58.230 --> 05:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
but because we have tools like easy to
 
05:39:02.150 --> 05:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
access home testing vaccine therapeutics
 
05:39:05.030 --> 05:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
we can get back to our more normal
 
05:39:07.270 --> 05:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
routines safely
 
05:39:09.750 --> 05:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
our job public health will can be to
 
05:39:12.230 --> 05:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
continue monitor that data ensure that
 
05:39:14.628 --> 05:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
we have the supplies and the technical
 
05:39:17.430 --> 05:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
resources to support the community as
 
05:39:20.150 --> 05:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
that data goes up and down
 
05:39:23.110 --> 05:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
so i want to thank you all all of our
 
05:39:25.910 --> 05:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
policy makers that have made it possible
 
05:39:28.230 --> 05:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
for us to use all of these tools in our
 
05:39:31.270 --> 05:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
toolbox to accept and to use the federal
 
05:39:33.030 --> 05:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
funds that have been made available to
 
05:39:35.270 --> 05:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
us to build relationships with our
 
05:39:38.070 --> 05:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
communities and businesses so that we
 
05:39:40.708 --> 05:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
could wade together through the
 
05:39:44.070 --> 05:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
unchartered waters of the past two years
 
05:39:46.868 --> 05:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you all of you for your
 
05:39:48.948 --> 05:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
questions and your engagement and your
 
05:39:50.628 --> 05:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
trust in us
 
05:39:53.110 --> 05:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
to protect the people of new hampshire
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
it's been a privilege um to do this for
 
05:39:58.868 --> 05:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
over two years so that's that's all i
 
05:40:00.628 --> 05:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
have for now i'm i'm happy to take any
 
05:40:00.638 --> 05:40:01.590 align:start position:0%
have for now i'm i'm happy to take any
questions

05:40:01.590 --> 05:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:40:03.030 --> 05:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
mr telly
 
05:40:05.430 --> 05:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
we are certainly appreciative of
 
05:40:07.030 --> 05:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
coming here and providing this
 
05:40:09.270 --> 05:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
information to us it's
 
05:40:11.750 --> 05:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's a great um
 
05:40:13.830 --> 05:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
great to hear that you're even doing new
 
05:40:16.788 --> 05:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
things like checking the waste water
 
05:40:16.798 --> 05:40:17.830 align:start position:0%
things like checking the waste water
that

05:40:17.830 --> 05:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:40:19.990 --> 05:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
who would have thought
 
05:40:22.230 --> 05:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
not me
 
05:40:23.990 --> 05:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
so we appreciate that representative
 
05:40:24.000 --> 05:40:25.270 align:start position:0%
so we appreciate that representative
ernest

05:40:25.270 --> 05:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
ernest
 
05:40:26.868 --> 05:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:40:28.628 --> 05:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
could you clarify the distinction
 
05:40:30.310 --> 05:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
between the immunization information
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
system and the vaccination registry
 
05:40:35.750 --> 05:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
yes sure so those those two terms are
 
05:40:38.708 --> 05:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
used interchangeably when the um
 
05:40:40.708 --> 05:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
legislate when early legislation the
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
rsas were written it was called a
 
05:40:45.030 --> 05:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry
 
05:40:47.030 --> 05:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
as many of us know that have talked a
 
05:40:48.948 --> 05:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
lot about the immunization information
 
05:40:51.590 --> 05:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
system or the vaccine registry work on
 
05:40:53.190 --> 05:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
developing that and that registry
 
05:40:53.200 --> 05:40:54.150 align:start position:0%
developing that and that registry
happened

05:40:54.150 --> 05:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
happened
 
05:40:55.910 --> 05:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
almost two decades started almost two
 
05:40:57.750 --> 05:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
decades ago and has really been in
 
05:41:00.390 --> 05:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
process for the past 10 years so again
 
05:41:01.750 --> 05:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
originally when that was authorized it
 
05:41:03.990 --> 05:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
was called the registry it is now called
 
05:41:05.910 --> 05:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
the immunization information system
 
05:41:07.590 --> 05:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
because it is much more than just a
 
05:41:10.548 --> 05:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
registry of people it also is our entire
 
05:41:12.948 --> 05:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
back end of our service of how you know
 
05:41:15.110 --> 05:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
the questions around wastage it is how
 
05:41:17.430 --> 05:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
we track vaccine when it comes into our
 
05:41:19.270 --> 05:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
building where it goes out into the
 
05:41:21.670 --> 05:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
community to make sure that
 
05:41:22.788 --> 05:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
we can
 
05:41:25.110 --> 05:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
ensure quality and safety for everyone
 
05:41:28.390 --> 05:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
so you know if there were a bad batch of
 
05:41:30.310 --> 05:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
varicella vaccines i don't even want to
 
05:41:32.470 --> 05:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
talk about covid but a bad batch of some
 
05:41:34.470 --> 05:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine early childhood vaccine we would
 
05:41:37.030 --> 05:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
be able to know oh we gave that to
 
05:41:38.948 --> 05:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
concord hospital and we would be able to
 
05:41:40.470 --> 05:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
track it so that's some of the the
 
05:41:43.350 --> 05:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
differentiations between those two terms
 
05:41:46.628 --> 05:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow follow-up
 
05:41:48.708 --> 05:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
so to clarify you're saying it's the
 
05:41:50.788 --> 05:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
same database
 
05:41:53.270 --> 05:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
where you record the vaccine dosage
 
05:41:53.280 --> 05:41:54.390 align:start position:0%
where you record the vaccine dosage
stuff

05:41:54.390 --> 05:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
05:41:56.150 --> 05:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
as will you record
 
05:41:59.830 --> 05:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
the people's vaccination status it it
 
05:42:03.190 --> 05:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
they are components of the same database
 
05:42:05.670 --> 05:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
so different modules this i will be much
 
05:42:07.590 --> 05:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
like i say i'm not a doctor i am also
 
05:42:09.670 --> 05:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
not an i.t specialist but they are
 
05:42:11.670 --> 05:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
components of the same things because
 
05:42:13.910 --> 05:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
those are often interrelated
 
05:42:13.920 --> 05:42:15.190 align:start position:0%
those are often interrelated
again

05:42:15.190 --> 05:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:42:18.470 --> 05:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
managing just the process of managing
 
05:42:21.350 --> 05:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know in this case two million doses
 
05:42:22.788 --> 05:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
all of those doses didn't all come
 
05:42:24.708 --> 05:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
through um the state of new hampshire
 
05:42:27.590 --> 05:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
but still a million plus doses has come
 
05:42:29.430 --> 05:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
through that system just the management
 
05:42:32.230 --> 05:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
side of it and then we have sort of the
 
05:42:34.070 --> 05:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
registry component which is the part
 
05:42:35.190 --> 05:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
that i think there's been lots of
 
05:42:37.110 --> 05:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
conversation about which is where you
 
05:42:39.670 --> 05:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
know patricia tilley had a vaccine dose
 
05:42:44.390 --> 05:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:44.400 --> 05:42:48.708 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:53.310 --> 05:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:56.230 --> 05:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
26 years ago when i joined the
 
05:42:59.350 --> 05:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
legislature on i was appalled to learn
 
05:42:59.360 --> 05:43:00.470 align:start position:0%
legislature on i was appalled to learn
that

05:43:00.470 --> 05:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:43:03.510 --> 05:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
the only public health officers
 
05:43:05.110 --> 05:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
05:43:09.110 --> 05:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
except for i think one person in hhs
 
05:43:12.390 --> 05:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
were appointed at town level
 
05:43:14.830 --> 05:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
frequently it was a plumber or an
 
05:43:18.150 --> 05:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
electrician or there might be a doctor
 
05:43:20.390 --> 05:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
who lived in town that was kind of told
 
05:43:22.548 --> 05:43:22.558 align:start position:0%
could you do this on the side
 
05:43:22.558 --> 05:43:23.670 align:start position:0%
could you do this on the side
um

05:43:23.670 --> 05:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:23.680 --> 05:43:24.708 align:start position:0%
um
suddenly

05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
suddenly
 
05:43:26.788 --> 05:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
i think it was three years ago before
 
05:43:31.030 --> 05:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic started on the upper valley
 
05:43:33.190 --> 05:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
had a public health council which is
 
05:43:36.628 --> 05:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
apparently part of a network of 15 or
 
05:43:39.110 --> 05:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
something public health councils
 
05:43:41.590 --> 05:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
05:43:44.390 --> 05:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
and the woman running it was
 
05:43:46.788 --> 05:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
doing public health work
 
05:43:48.948 --> 05:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
very well
 
05:43:51.830 --> 05:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
and can you tell me how
 
05:43:54.230 --> 05:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
how is this being financed and is it a
 
05:43:56.470 --> 05:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
one-time thing that's going to disappear
 
05:43:58.788 --> 05:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
again or
 
05:44:01.750 --> 05:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
until the next pandemic
 
05:44:03.830 --> 05:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question so
 
05:44:05.750 --> 05:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
um you've touched on a couple of things
 
05:44:07.910 --> 05:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
we still have health officers in all of
 
05:44:09.990 --> 05:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
our community and those are you know
 
05:44:10.000 --> 05:44:10.788 align:start position:0%
our community and those are you know
again

05:44:10.788 --> 05:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:44:12.868 --> 05:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
it depends community community sometimes
 
05:44:14.708 --> 05:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
they're a doctor sometimes they're a
 
05:44:16.070 --> 05:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
fire person
 
05:44:17.270 --> 05:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
and they really work with the
 
05:44:19.350 --> 05:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities on a lot of the
 
05:44:21.910 --> 05:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory issues or coding or nuisance
 
05:44:24.628 --> 05:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
issues they are also providing expertise
 
05:44:26.150 --> 05:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know and recommendations and
 
05:44:27.350 --> 05:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
especially in the beginning part of the
 
05:44:29.190 --> 05:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic they were working with
 
05:44:31.430 --> 05:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
businesses around restaurants around how
 
05:44:34.708 --> 05:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
to manage um the guidelines around covet
 
05:44:37.350 --> 05:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
19. but i think what your you really
 
05:44:39.350 --> 05:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
spoke about was our public health
 
05:44:41.830 --> 05:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
networks which are separate from that so
 
05:44:43.190 --> 05:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
the health officers are part of the
 
05:44:44.788 --> 05:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
municipal government
 
05:44:47.030 --> 05:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
our public health networks we have 13 of
 
05:44:48.788 --> 05:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
them around the state are really
 
05:44:51.670 --> 05:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
community based organizations we fund
 
05:44:55.030 --> 05:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
them with mostly federal dollars
 
05:44:57.270 --> 05:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that do go up and down
 
05:44:57.280 --> 05:44:58.150 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that do go up and down
but

05:44:58.150 --> 05:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:44:59.510 --> 05:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
in large part our public health
 
05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness money is called
 
05:45:01.680 --> 05:45:02.628 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness money is called
fep

05:45:02.628 --> 05:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
fep
 
05:45:05.430 --> 05:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
they receive a lot of those dollars
 
05:45:07.590 --> 05:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
as well as some other pieces of money
 
05:45:09.830 --> 05:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
that we've had over time and they're the
 
05:45:11.430 --> 05:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
ones who've really been the boots on the
 
05:45:13.350 --> 05:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
ground right now doing a lot of those
 
05:45:13.360 --> 05:45:14.708 align:start position:0%
ground right now doing a lot of those
community

05:45:14.708 --> 05:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:45:18.310 --> 05:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinics and really engaging
 
05:45:21.030 --> 05:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
with their hospitals and others you know
 
05:45:22.150 --> 05:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things we're thinking about
 
05:45:23.910 --> 05:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
right now are the vaccines for the
 
05:45:25.830 --> 05:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
youngest children for the six month olds
 
05:45:28.470 --> 05:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
to the four-year-olds nobody anticipate
 
05:45:29.350 --> 05:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
you're not going to go through a
 
05:45:31.110 --> 05:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
drive-through with a six-month-old
 
05:45:33.830 --> 05:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
you're not going to go into an old sears
 
05:45:35.990 --> 05:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
with a six-month-old we know that those
 
05:45:37.590 --> 05:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines have to be given by
 
05:45:39.430 --> 05:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
pediatricians those parents have
 
05:45:40.948 --> 05:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
questions they want they need to have
 
05:45:43.670 --> 05:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
answered before they would consider that
 
05:45:45.510 --> 05:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
so our public health networks instead of
 
05:45:46.868 --> 05:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
being the ones to put the shots in the
 
05:45:48.470 --> 05:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
arms are actually now going to be
 
05:45:50.548 --> 05:45:50.558 align:start position:0%
deployed to those health care workers to
 
05:45:52.310 --> 05:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
help do some of the administrative
 
05:45:54.310 --> 05:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
burden like you know getting people into
 
05:45:57.030 --> 05:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
a clinic and and helping so those are
 
05:45:58.868 --> 05:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
the sorts of activities that they do
 
05:46:00.470 --> 05:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's funded by federal dollars the
 
05:46:02.948 --> 05:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
federal dollars go up and down and they
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
do what we can afford to allow them to
 
05:46:05.520 --> 05:46:07.190 align:start position:0%
do what we can afford to allow them to
do

05:46:07.190 --> 05:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:46:10.788 --> 05:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:13.270 --> 05:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:46:14.548 --> 05:46:14.558 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:46:16.150 --> 05:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
i think you mentioned that there's been
 
05:46:17.430 --> 05:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
one death
 
05:46:19.270 --> 05:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
and each death is unfortunate but one
 
05:46:22.310 --> 05:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
death of a child from age zero to nine
 
05:46:24.310 --> 05:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
and i know a lot of a lot of people i
 
05:46:25.910 --> 05:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
talk to a lot of constituents people are
 
05:46:28.150 --> 05:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
very nervous about giving their young
 
05:46:30.310 --> 05:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
children the vaccine
 
05:46:34.150 --> 05:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
given this type of data of one death
 
05:46:35.910 --> 05:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
is and then of course you hear how
 
05:46:38.230 --> 05:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know a child won't react
 
05:46:40.390 --> 05:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
well and it can be life-threatening to
 
05:46:41.830 --> 05:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
get the shot i mean
 
05:46:43.830 --> 05:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
how what what do you recommend is a good
 
05:46:46.548 --> 05:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
thing to to tell anxious parents
 
05:46:48.470 --> 05:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
given that data that that's a great
 
05:46:51.110 --> 05:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
question um this is this is a balance
 
05:46:53.430 --> 05:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
for each family you know i think i've
 
05:46:54.948 --> 05:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
been in several committees not
 
05:46:57.670 --> 05:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily this committee but um others
 
05:46:59.910 --> 05:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know the the department at this time
 
05:47:02.150 --> 05:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
has no intention of requiring covet 19
 
05:47:05.190 --> 05:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine for schools because we know um
 
05:47:08.230 --> 05:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
families have questions we also know
 
05:47:10.708 --> 05:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
that um you know children typically
 
05:47:13.270 --> 05:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the most severe outcomes of
 
05:47:15.990 --> 05:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
covid19 there was a death of a child
 
05:47:17.830 --> 05:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
we've had 24 cases of this really
 
05:47:21.270 --> 05:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
significant outcome however we know that
 
05:47:23.670 --> 05:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
covid19 spreads easily when your kids
 
05:47:25.990 --> 05:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
have it you know that grandma grandpa
 
05:47:28.390 --> 05:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
yourselves your parents are at higher
 
05:47:30.948 --> 05:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
risk if there's more more disease in
 
05:47:32.548 --> 05:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
your house or more infections in your
 
05:47:34.708 --> 05:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
house we also don't know what the
 
05:47:36.948 --> 05:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
long-term effect of covid19 will be on
 
05:47:36.958 --> 05:47:38.310 align:start position:0%
long-term effect of covid19 will be on
children

05:47:38.310 --> 05:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:47:40.628 --> 05:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
that's still up in the air and so i
 
05:47:43.750 --> 05:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
think parents with their physicians make
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
the decisions that are best for them
 
05:47:48.230 --> 05:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
given all weighing all of those odds you
 
05:47:50.390 --> 05:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
know many parents have just like the
 
05:47:53.030 --> 05:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
freedom that comes with a vaccine it's a
 
05:47:55.110 --> 05:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
little less of something to worry about
 
05:47:57.190 --> 05:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
from just a very logistical standpoint
 
05:47:59.350 --> 05:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
they want to go to florida on vacation
 
05:48:01.270 --> 05:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
and they want to make sure they have an
 
05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
extra layer of protection that they
 
05:48:04.470 --> 05:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
don't have to stay back home because
 
05:48:06.708 --> 05:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
somebody is ill
 
05:48:06.718 --> 05:48:09.990 align:start position:0%
somebody is ill
follow-up

05:48:09.990 --> 05:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:11.590 --> 05:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that people might want to
 
05:48:13.350 --> 05:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
do it so that they wouldn't spread the
 
05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
disease but
 
05:48:16.310 --> 05:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
05:48:16.320 --> 05:48:18.150 align:start position:0%
it seems like
um

05:48:18.150 --> 05:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:19.830 --> 05:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
whether you're vaccinated or not i mean
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm vaccinated i got covet my wife
 
05:48:24.310 --> 05:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
is vaccinated she got covered i know all
 
05:48:25.830 --> 05:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
sorts of people that are vaccinated and
 
05:48:27.350 --> 05:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
got copied so
 
05:48:30.230 --> 05:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not does that i mean
 
05:48:31.990 --> 05:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
everything else you said you know makes
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
sense but in terms of not spreading it
 
05:48:36.628 --> 05:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
as much if you're if you're vaccinated
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
is that really what data do we have for
 
05:48:40.548 --> 05:48:40.558 align:start position:0%
that so the data really is around viral
 
05:48:43.110 --> 05:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
spread so it depends how much um you
 
05:48:45.670 --> 05:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
know it we know if you are unvaccinated
 
05:48:48.310 --> 05:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
you have greater viral shed than if you
 
05:48:51.270 --> 05:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
are vaccinated so it has been suggested
 
05:48:54.070 --> 05:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
that a number of people who have who are
 
05:48:57.110 --> 05:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
protected by vaccine who get sick um
 
05:48:59.990 --> 05:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
got it from someone who was unvaccinated
 
05:49:02.948 --> 05:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
because they were had a bro a more viral
 
05:49:05.750 --> 05:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
shed than others we also know that
 
05:49:07.030 --> 05:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
there's a reason we had to do the
 
05:49:10.150 --> 05:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
booster because we needed another little
 
05:49:13.270 --> 05:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
bump up so those are all the
 
05:49:15.670 --> 05:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
all of it is somewhat imperfect as we're
 
05:49:17.590 --> 05:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
learning and that's why people just need
 
05:49:18.708 --> 05:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
to make a
 
05:49:20.948 --> 05:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
a decision based on their own personal
 
05:49:23.590 --> 05:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
risks and the risks of their family
 
05:49:24.470 --> 05:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:49:26.150 --> 05:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know i'll just finish you know if
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
you have a family member who's going
 
05:49:30.230 --> 05:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
through chemotherapy or is very immune
 
05:49:32.070 --> 05:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
compromised you're gonna you might make
 
05:49:33.430 --> 05:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
a different
 
05:49:36.868 --> 05:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:39.590 --> 05:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:49:42.310 --> 05:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much thank you
 
05:49:44.628 --> 05:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
and for the committee members that are
 
05:49:47.030 --> 05:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
still left here
 
05:49:50.150 --> 05:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
enjoy your weekend yes you do
