00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh call a Mee to
 
00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 align:start position:0%
order so um first step uh let's let's do
 
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
the pledge John alers and Pledge of
 
00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
here United States of
 
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
America stands one
 
00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
nation indivisible with liberty and
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
justice for all thank
 
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.789 align:start position:0%
justice for all thank
you

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
so since the uh last meeting the uh we
 
00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
had formed a subcommittee to look at as
 
00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 align:start position:0%
we all know we had money to uh bring in
 
00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
consultants and uh the original
 
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee was uh the
 
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
chair uh
 
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
goo uh Fred Charlie and Aaron but then
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
joining us that day were Tim Senator
 
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
Lang and representative Ames as well so
 
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
we had a pretty good group there um
 
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
where we talked through the issues and
 
00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 align:start position:0%
decided I think on the basic framework
 
00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
of an RFP that will be going out and
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
then Charlie thankfully
 
00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
volunteered to to put put the meat
 
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
around the put the meat around the bones
 
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
and then all the boiler plate that goes
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
with a state RFP which most of us don't
 
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
know so uh Charlie do you just want to
 
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
just talk to it and then since since
 
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
Charlie uh got this now everybody
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
received that in advance you have it in
 
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
front of you anyway but um since then
 
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
Aaron Aaron got back to us I think Fred
 
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh the games got back to us with some
 
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts on on this as well so Charlie
 
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
sure I'll jump in start um Mr chair the
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
um was a basic draft of what an RFB
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
looks like for a gaming consultant um it
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
was based on the conversations we had at
 
00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee at our offices um and
 
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
it was forwarded to the subcommittee
 
00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 align:start position:0%
last Wednesday I believe for comments
 
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
and uh input um and soly I'll leave it
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
there um and happy to take any input
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
obviously this is a document created for
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
the for the membership not just us uh
 
00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
and but it is a state RFP so does have
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
to comport to State RFP requirements but
 
00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
it does not in terms of the the guts of
 
00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:30.270 align:start position:0%
it does not in terms of the the guts of
it

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
the it's open for a discussion and
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
revisions so okay I think I think Aaron
 
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
you were the first to weigh in if you'd
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
like to just uh make your comments about
 
00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
see right and I I think the key thing
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
there is other HHR jurisdictions I mean
 
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
there are difference between slot
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
machines and these historic racing
 
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
machines so I think we we do want to
 
00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
compare apples to apples as best we can
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
so uh I I I don't have a problem with
 
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
expanding it I don't know about anybody
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
else who else would like to weigh on
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
that dick just to say just to say that I
 
00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
concur thank you for picking that
 
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
up Fred Fred you had some comments too
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
that you had shared
 
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
exactly it you know it just be repeating
 
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
the same we need to compare apples to
 
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
apples you know uh we can't compare the
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh the slot machines I'm sure the
 
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
operators would love slot machines but
 
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
um you know we need to compare what we
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
have if I
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
recall the two that was specifically
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.909 align:start position:0%
 
Virginia

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 align:start position:0%
Virginia
 
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 align:start position:0%
oh there we go uh yeah they're the two
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
largest I think most comparable in terms
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
of number of properties and number of
 
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
scale just a question see you seem to be
 
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
do what about West Virginia what's West
 
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
Virginia got West Virginia has full slot
 
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
machines and I don't know if they're
 
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
technically slot machines or VTS but
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
they're full gaming okay and and they
 
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
operate like 24/7 correct correct
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
okay so I think they might be a good
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
somebody for us to look at those are lar
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
there some very large scale conss I
 
00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 align:start position:0%
think thousands of games and and some of
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
the ones near DC so size may be
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
different but I think sure I mean I
 
00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
think the more jurisdictions we compare
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
it to the better that way it doesn't
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
allow people to poke holes through it
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
right sure sure thank you thank you m
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I tend to agree with that last
 
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.189 align:start position:0%
yeah I tend to agree with that last
statement

00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
too I mean for a consultant I shouldn't
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
take them that long to figure out all
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
these other states they probably already
 
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
know the information about uh we should
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
have as large a sample as we can get oh
 
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
yeah sure I mean I gaming across the
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
country takes all kinds of
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
forms you know whether it be class two
 
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
or you know slot machines and HHR
 
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
machines are both class three they just
 
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
are and so you shouldn't limit it to
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
just HHR machines you should see what
 
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
the if we're worried about saturation
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
you should see what other jurisdictions
 
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
have for saturation
 
00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:31.519 align:start position:0%
as well as what the revenue is per
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction per device it shouldn't be
 
00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
limited by state it should be limited by
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
revenues being drawn from the populace
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
around it so I would in the interest of
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
opening it up I think I can redraft it
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
so that it's comparable jurisdictions or
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
comparable gaming jurisdictions because
 
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
401 gaming jurisdictions something like
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
that so they would have this data at
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
hand so I can open it up liter just not
 
00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
limit it to two other states but but
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
also but but do emphasize
 
00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
that let's make sure we have enough uh
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
historic racing yeah no question
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
yeah hisor racing in Arkansas this hisor
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
racing in
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
Wyoming I know I'm missing
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
one uh those are the big ones but
 
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
certainly V I think Virginia and
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
Kentucky have a similar model of number
 
00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:23.079 align:start position:0%
of I think and I think Senator delandro
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
brings up a great Point too whether it's
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
calculated into what comes back from
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
from these reports hours of operation
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
there there's a difference there
 
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
definitive difference and how do they
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
calculate that into a 24hour day
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
operation compared to the model we have
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
so there's a component there I'm sure
 
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to have to play in right so
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
the RFB process we're going to bring
 
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
bring these um unclone vendors
 
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
in uh before us uh to describe what
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to do or what they're
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
proposing to do yeah we may we may
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
narrow that down a little B beforehand
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
but we we'll see who kind of meets the
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
criteria if I could propose a schedule
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
because time is the essence rfps take a
 
00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
while we have to get GNC approval um
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
because it is a state contract so I
 
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
would propose that I'll take a redraft
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
based on this conversation send it out
 
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
today's Monday you should get it by
 
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and then if there's no
 
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
objection we'll go with it and I'll
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
we'll release it next
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
Monday um there's a time there's a

of companies and I know spectrum is an
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
obvious one and and you mentioned
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
Innovation there's a couple others I
 
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.629 align:start position:0%
Innovation there's a couple others I
know

00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:58.030 align:start position:0%
know
but

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
yeah and so Mr chairman if you want to
 
00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
appoint an RFP committee versus the
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
group as an RFP sort of questions and
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
answers and the like or you rather do it
 
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
as as the committee of the whole oh as
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
as we get questions from the vendors
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think the whole I think it
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
should be limited maybe you and I
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%

you've done our fees before I've done
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
thousands you'll get a lot of questions
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
I had sent out last night sorry it was
 
00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
so late um also with the wrong email
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
heading but uh I managed to get it out
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
um some additional language for the RFP
 
00:12:55.189 --> 00:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
as a suggestion and Charlie I hope you
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
got that maybe you didn't no I'm just
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
sorry I right the meetings this morning
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
all right um I got some I made some
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
copies I don't know whether there's
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
why yeah that's is fine the uh
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
but you see in uh huge black
 
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
letters um at the bottom and then over
 
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
the next is is what I'm suggesting this
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
isn't a big deal by the way it's
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
just I in section two of the RFP there's
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
a description of charal gaming and it's
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
basic basically the games and um and I
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
thought since we're asking the uh
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
respondents to this RFP to give us a a
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
proposal um related to charitable gaming
 
00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:05.759 align:start position:0%
that we needed to flesh this out and
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
reference the regulatory structure the
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
fact that these games can uh uh live and
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
Thrive hopefully in the same setting as
 
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.269 align:start position:0%
Thrive hopefully in the same setting as
other

00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
games um and um that we do have some
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions related to responsible gaming
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
including a
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
Council um and just flag that so that
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
the respondents will respond to
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
the the context that we live in get the
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
idea and and Charlie you can do a better
 
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
job than I can so feel free
 
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.310 align:start position:0%
job than I can so feel free
to

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
obviously yes and the other thing that
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
dick uh did send to us is
 
00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:01.959 align:start position:0%
uh you s everybody I I forward that to
 
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
all members of the commission this is Ed
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
talber who's uh one the co-director of
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
the Council on on what on responsible
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
gaming um and uh he wrote a letter about
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh self-exclusion
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh and the process which he he's and
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
others have found frustrating um and uh
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to flag that issue for the
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
commission uh he it's a letter to the
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
commission members it's not a letter to
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
me but he's dealt with me before so uh
 
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
he found it easier to send it to me and
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
asked me to forward it so that's what
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
you got there uh just being forwarded by
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
me and it's a very interesting letter by
 
00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:50.759 align:start position:0%
the way about sort of the uh the
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
Grassroots issues that arise around uh
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
responsible gaming this is again in as
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
side this is nothing to do with the P
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
but uh without objection I think we'll
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
we'll invite the council in one of our
 
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
meetings to discuss this yeah that would
 
00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:09.069 align:start position:0%
meetings to discuss this yeah that would
be

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
great i' I've I've noticed uh it maybe
 
00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
some of my colleagues have noticed that
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
now responsible gaming and how you do it
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
is now part of the the message that's
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
coming across with the ads I don't bet
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
too much be careful to do this do this
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
do this to this bag bag bag bag you know
 
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
points that are noted uh by let's call
 
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.829 align:start position:0%
points that are noted uh by let's call
responsible

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
individuals I think it's it's important
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
it seems to be that's coming all all of
 
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.870 align:start position:0%
it seems to be that's coming all all of
a

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
sudden there's a re there's a reason why
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
that's coming and uh I I I I think with
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
the tremendous expansion of activity and
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
how you do it uh there are problems that
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh come along with that and we all we
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
all have to face that that's all I yeah
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
I think that the the industry the
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
industry understands that and is looking
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
for a way to deal with it right think
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
within our scope of what we're going to
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
do we're going to be addressing this and
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
I think this is they they
 
00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
volunteered their thoughts I think we
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
should invite them in to discuss it
 
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
further so that'll be great uh what I
 
00:17:29.789 --> 00:17:29.799 align:start position:0%
neglected to do was uh to mention that
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
um uh attorney general from all hasn't
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
been able to make our meetings and U
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
he's uh agreed to have a substitute
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
which we allow we do allow
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
substitutes uh to come before us and
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
this is Mark
 
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
theofano that it right you got it right
 
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
there you go okay Mark Mark turns to do
 
00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:54.039 align:start position:0%
turns out he does a lot of work with
 
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
with the lottery uh so so he knows the
 
00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.430 align:start position:0%

topic

00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
got so all right I wanted to keep the
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
number the same uh given the fact that
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
General attend good all right so uh I
 
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
think we're going to move forward as we
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
discussed that uh Charlie take another
 
00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
crack at this with the input that we got
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
from the members uh it sounds like we're
 
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
all agreeing with the changes that were
 
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.110 align:start position:0%
all agreeing with the changes that were
being

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
proposed uh and then uh you'll send it
 
00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:51.799 align:start position:0%
out to the
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
members and then we'll do a quick a it's
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
got to be a quick response if you have
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
any other comments respond on that day
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
you get it please uh when you think it's
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to go on Wednesday or something
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
like that because we we want to get this
 
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
RFP out and wheels Mo in motion on this
 
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:11.799 align:start position:0%
one uh so that we have enough time for
 
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
them to do their work that the
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
Consultants do their work and then for
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
us to uh digest hear what they have to
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
say and formulate any recommendations
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
that we need to down the
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
road GNC yes get on the calendar for the
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
governor and Council for
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
right uh yeah explain how that works
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
again I think it's going to be you and I
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
right uh likely yeah you and I uh we'll
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
go up and um it's submitted through
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
Department of adment Services there's a
 
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
calendar which you have to get below be
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
in front of a certain date to on the
 
00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
regular calendar I would suggest not
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
being on the sort of emergency calendar
 
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
the council doesn't like that they just
 
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
don't they like would they want to have
 
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
a time to think about it read it um they
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
may have questions about it so in the
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
past this RFP has been proposed to them
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
and we've had questions from the
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
counselors which I imagine we'll have as
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
well so so this is the the RFP itself or
 
00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.039 align:start position:0%
who we decide to select it's the who we
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
select and the request to contract with
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
that person has to be approved by the
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
executive Council okay so that that
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
would be the back end of the RFP process
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
correct there would be the last step
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
before they're engaged right right
 
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
they're usually it's a very small subset
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
of the group goes um
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
usually sort of in past it's been the
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
three people in this side of it's the
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
AG's office the head of the lottery and
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee okay all right so
 
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
but that's your call to sort of if you
 
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
want to appoint folks to go there's no
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
magic to it it's just that's how it's
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
worked because I have to go because it's
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
out of our budget right so so if they
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
decide to have a meeting in Coos County
 
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.270 align:start position:0%
decide to have a meeting in Coos County
that

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
day if you to go to p
 
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
I know they make I know they take the
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
road the show on the road so ums that's
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
why I want to get this our meeting oh
 
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
right all right so that's the RFP I
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
think we're all set
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
there um since our last
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
meeting uh the
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
house uh Ways and Means Committee voted
 
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
out an amendment to Senate Bill
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
112 and I thought it important that we
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
understand what was in Senate Bill 112
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
and U Fred set on our commission here
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
was the Prime sponsor of that Amendment
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
so Fred I I ask Fred to just kind of
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
walk through what that that Amendment
 
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
will sure and thank you Mr chairman just
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
keeping to the the two major points
 
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
because there is some housekeeping stuff
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
relative to employee residency and other
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
things what what it comes down to is uh
 
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:06.919 align:start position:0%
um the HHR machines and Licensing them
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
um the moratorium language that we've
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
all talked about we don't necessarily
 
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
all agree on but we can agree that this
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
the formation of this commission doesn't
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
negate us going forward as far as uh
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
pushing legislation it um what I did
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
with this was allow for the present
 
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
operators who have applied for is or who
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
are in the process of uh securing HHR in
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
their charitable Gaming facilities and
 
00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
also anyone else in the queue that may
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
have an application in with Lottery at
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
present uh up until October 18th of this
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
past year so that window uh is closed on
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
the 18th from what uh director McIntyre
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
has told me there's five applications in
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
the queue so that would bring us up up
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
to about 19 operators with the ability
 
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.029 align:start position:0%
to about 19 operators with the ability
for

00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
HHR um also uh another major component
 
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
that we've discussed at this commission
 
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
is the component of rent to the
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
Charities and this basically in a
 
00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:16.039 align:start position:0%
nutshell eliminates the ability of any
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
of these operators to collect rent from
 
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
stop okay so um so let's go back to the
 
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
first item
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
so what your bill does it says Uh
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
there's a is this a temporary
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
moratorium um as it's written no it's a
 
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.149 align:start position:0%
moratorium um as it's written no it's a
permanent

00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
moratorium um and we all know that one
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
legislature does not bind the hands of
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
another but it's my my belief and the
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
people that I represent in Salem who
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
believe that that this needs to be hard
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
stopped at this point because of uh
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
saturation and and and uh what the
 
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
possibility of the future in relation to
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
this particular game may or may not be
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
well this certainly is topic that this
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
commission is going to be addressing
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
anyway I mean you you you you moved
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
forward with a bill still hasn't passed
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
the house so let's go to the Senate so
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh but obviously this is a a ma one of
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
the major things we have to talk about
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
as commission as we move forward uh and
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
like you said I mean it's it's a bill so
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
the next legisl you can we always change
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
it so um dick yeah thank you um well I'm
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
also on ways and means uh as are others
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
here and um house ways means um and uh
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
uh supported this amendment uh and uh
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
continue to support it and one uh under
 
00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
understanding that we all have just
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned by representative set is that
 
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:08.919 align:start position:0%
um that what is uh done today can be
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
changed tomorrow by uh the legislature
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
and um in this case I think this is an
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
issue that the commission will be
 
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:22.919 align:start position:0%
looking at um and um essentially this
 
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
provision keeps alive our options uh to
 
00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
to look at uh whether there should be uh
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
additional expansion or tighten probably
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
not tightening up very much CU it's hard
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
to go back once you've opened the door
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
and this uh this closes the door but
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
that door can be open a crack
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
or a little more and um so we can look
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
at it in that regard we're not uh we're
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
not uh facing a um complete opening of
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
the door such that when we get around to
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
making our
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations um you know the barn
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
door has been opened and it'll be hard
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
to close it I didn't say that very
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
clearly but I do I do um uh support this
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh change that we're going to be voting
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
on pretty soon and um and see it as
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
preserving the uh
 
00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:25.430 align:start position:0%
preserving the uh
um

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh the situation so the commission can
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
speak to it um and do de a deeper dive
 
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
than we were able to do at Ways and
 
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
Means okay thank you dick um any other
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
comments on that okay back to the back
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
to the rent
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
issue uh um I think we probably would
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
have wound up there at this point uh
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
that we would we would get rid of the
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
rid of the R again my only
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
concern is for the smaller places I'm
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
this big picture now there was a reason
 
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
why there was rent and that this is
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
before HHR HHR times and all of that and
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
that was that you know this is evolved
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
from m i call Mom and Pop mom and pop
 
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
facilities that were hey Charities come
 
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
help us come we're we're going to create
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
a place we have table games and you you
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
come in and in your charity can sponsor
 
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
nights and by the way it's a risk to us
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
and to hedge against the risk I must
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
some of the legislators at the time must
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
said okay well I'll rent to protect the
 
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
bad days in other words it could be that
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
we're you know we're having a couple of
 
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
days there was snow days whatever they
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
still stay off the tables and they
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
didn't make any money on it so so they
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
decided that okay they could charge
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
rent uh I think we're beyond that when
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
you look at the numbers the numbers the
 
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
revenues are really getting bigger and
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
bigger uh but there's still a few small
 
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
ones uh when I look at at North
 
00:28:15.399 --> 00:28:16.750 align:start position:0%
ones uh when I look at at North
Northwoods

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
Northwoods
 
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
Casino who's that who's
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
Northwoods burin right so they uh from
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
the data that Charlie provided us the
 
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
$106,000 uh for one year and the and I
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
did the math backwards so that meant uh
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
that that was the 35% allocation so the
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
other 65% was about
 
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
197,000 so combined that's around I
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
don't know down about
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
300 uh about yeah around three just call
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
300,000 in Revenue
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh it seems
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
like I've talked to some people about
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
this it seems like the association of
 
00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:09.519 align:start position:0%
these these locations these
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
organizations has support of of all all
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.509 align:start position:0%
of the
facilities

00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
uh what I'm getting at is
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
that I think we I think we in a position
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
right now to take a position on this uh
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
do we want to hear from some of smaller
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
locations uh before we we weigh in on
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
the rent issue because my goal is to try
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
to take one of these issues at a time
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
and and take it off the table and say
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
look let's vote on it and move on to
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
something else to talk about um um so I
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
think we're pretty close to saying yeah
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
I mean Fred your bill trying to jump the
 
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
gun a little bit that's fine but as
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
commission I think rent the time of
 
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
rents is long gone it sounds like the
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
association is agreeing with that
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.789 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:05.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
yeah so again I think that apologize for
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
my voice but I think that um Again The
 
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
Operators have come to an agreement that
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
this is an okay provision they're okay
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
with removing rent as an organiz as a uh
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
organization so you know we can take our
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
position of what we want but just
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
understand the people are going to be
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
getting the money or saying no we're
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
okay with not take getting the money so
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
right so I yeah I just say one thing on
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
that so I think the association if I'm
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
not mistaken is good with it but tied to
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
the moratorium if the moratorium doesn't
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
happen then it could be a financial
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
burden on some of the smaller properties
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
okay so that's an interesting piece of
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
information because I mean I can
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
um without the
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
moratorium I mean this is a big issue
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
for us to discuss as we move forward I
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
mean how how many these facilities do we
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
really want in the state I mean if if we
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
weren't talking charitable gaming we're
 
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
talking real casinos we wouldn't be
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
talking about 19
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
casinos um and and then the other issue
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
is not just casinos but how many how
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
many historic racing machines how many
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines do we think is
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable now we know in the
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
legislature we know that there's free
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
market let the market dictate that let
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
the market dictate how many machines let
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
the doet dictate how many
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
locations but we know the more there are
 
00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
and there going to be survival of of
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
Fitts out
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
there uh but but when we look at other
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
states they all restrict the number of
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
locations no okay Charlie help me out it
 
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
does huh L it does Nevada you can get a
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
license in Nevada on Nevada okay so
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
there's one on Nevada is Nevada and also
 
00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
the number of states it's limited Tri
 
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
tribal as well likeed trib we have to
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
word we don't have that issue so but
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
those those are isses we got to address
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
um so dick I know you had your okay your
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
I I think two things become having been
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
around this business for a few years I I
 
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
would I would say to you that
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
proliferation has always been a
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
concerned we we were opposed more than
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
one for 20 years so uh now we're talking
 
00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:29.029 align:start position:0%
one for 20 years so uh now we're talking
about

00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
19 uh how much how much will will this
 
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
community will this community called do
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
him should bear in terms of the number
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
of entities that that are are in place I
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's imperative that we put a
 
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
number in place we're talking about pop
 
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about the number of
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
dispensaries that that we can have so
 
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
we're we're in the we're in the habit of
 
00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
of of creating a situation where there's
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
a certain number that are that that
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
required I I think it's an imperative
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
and with regard to the red boo boo Dell
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
put all of this together in the in the
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
Senate a number of years ago that's
 
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
where the 35% came from and that's where
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
all of the abilities that were were put
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
in place were were developed we did that
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
in set it ways and meanss and I think
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
the house accepted
 
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
that I I I don't think that there was
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
any appreciation for the expansion that
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
has taken place over the last few years
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
and and certainly with the Advent of
 
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing machines you got
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
another entity that's in the mix now
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
that uh plays a significant
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
role and whether you equate it with a
 
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
with a slot machine or or or or not it
 
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
is what it is and uh I I I think
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
proliferation certainly the the vendors
 
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
I mean those who are who are operating
 
00:33:55.149 --> 00:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
are going to have a distinct opinion of
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
this you got to limit this thing to a
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
certain number chis otherwise it's it
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
just gets out of hand I I mean how many
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
how many chly do we really have an
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
operation as we
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
speak uh it's 10 now and I think I sent
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
out to the sub committee there are 1,00
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
machines in activity currently uh that
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
number is proposed to grow um and I
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
would submit you know do 10 hot dog
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
stands at 10 restaurants I I don't know
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
I would the machines are what concern me
 
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the number in the
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
proliferation more than the number of
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
facilities does um that to me is a
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
bigger concern than um the number of
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
facilities like I to me there should
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
almost be a quota system for machines
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
like but then again you're getting
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
protectionist or do we set a set a limit
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
on locations and times
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
and it seems to be on one hand we're
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
being protectionist and the other hand
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
we're saying let the free market decide
 
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
well well I think look at if I might Mr
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
look at what we've done with the time
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
the the time element that's now
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
available you can open at 8:00 in the
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
morning you could go until what 2 3
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
4: that that's that's an enormous
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
movement in in one One Direction that
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
was never Vision uh in in the early
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
stages of of this activity so I I I
 
00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:29.079 align:start position:0%
agree with you when you talk about
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
machines and the number and the number
 
00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.589 align:start position:0%
machines and the number and the number
of

00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
machines that becomes another I think a
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
very interesting situation here you if I
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
good Mr chairman the the vast bulk of
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
the machines that are proposed will be
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
on the southern border and so the to
 
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
representative Jet's point about Salem
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to Bear the brunt of the
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
activity yeah versus like for example
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
North Country yeah just because of the
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
population density population density is
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
a given in gambling it's a variable that
 
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.069 align:start position:0%
a given in gambling it's a variable that
matters

00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
tremendously um ter for the math and for
 
00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.470 align:start position:0%
tremendously um ter for the math and for
the

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
revenues yes so again I I think we
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
recognize this when we put rules in
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
place the idea was using the revenue
 
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
multiplier as a way of controlling um
 
00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
the difference between a game of chance
 
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
and a historical horse racing and how
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
much that balance could look like and
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
maybe that's the appropriate place we
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
look maybe not the number of locations
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
but how that balance plays out right
 
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
again the idea was we wanted to
 
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
encourage more games of chance but allow
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
for uh HHR and so a multiplier was put
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
in to keep a ratio between those two
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
things um so that was the way I think we
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
looked at it um when we when we passed
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
this was a way of managing and
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
controlling this was using that ratio of
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
gaming table games and GES a chance to
 
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.550 align:start position:0%
gaming table games and GES a chance to
machine

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
machine
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
B okay again we're not going to solve
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
this today but this this is this is
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
going to be the Crux of
 
00:36:58.829 --> 00:36:58.839 align:start position:0%
again the information we get from the
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
Consultants will be helpful too on this
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
issue um Charlie pend
 
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
out yeah it's just a sort of a breakdown
 
00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
sorry it's a breakdown of the number of
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
machines per capita and where we lie on
 
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
that Spectrum we are less saturated than
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island we are more saturated than
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
Maine in terms of machines per person
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
already right the 19 we you say we have
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
1900 23 machines yes that's correct that
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
that'll fluctuate given the day there
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
not that's just a snapshot when we got
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
that day I think from a day two days
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
before so it'll be around there but
 
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
it'll be growing over time I don't
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
imagine that number to get low lower so
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
without the without the gross that we're
 
00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
anticipating in the state yes we're at
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
725 machines per capita all the way
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
around people per machine people's
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
people per machine correct and
 
00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.270 align:start position:0%
people per machine correct and
Massachusetts

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
1353 P machine yeah and the average in
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
New England of those States was I
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
believe 788 so we're slightly more
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
saturated than average so Mr chair yeah
 
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm curious as to why Connecticut
 
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't included was curios they're
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
tribal they're tribal casinos and their
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
relationship is not statutory based it
 
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
was it's limited wholly by
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what the machines are
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
currently but there was the time
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
Foxwoods and we some with the two
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
biggest casinos in the world so they
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
would probably have upwards of 10,000 I
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
believe and so they would be 10,000
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
divided by 3 million you're talking 300
 
00:38:41.069 --> 00:38:41.079 align:start position:0%
per person 300 people per machine no
 
00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:42.990 align:start position:0%
per person 300 people per machine no
just

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
curiosity was their their growth and
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
derivation was litigation number of
 
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuits the tribes Su the state of
 
00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.790 align:start position:0%
lawsuits the tribes Su the state of
concut

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
so okay so uh I think the discussion on
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
the on on rent
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
uh I think we are in agreement but I I'm
 
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
going to hold off to maybe the meeting
 
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
at two from now we we'll actually vote
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
on that as to that we we think R should
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
should uh be eliminated although there
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
was a little caveat
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
here uh that it would be tied the folks
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
from the especially the small location
 
00:39:28.589 --> 00:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure there was a cap on
 
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
it so maybe we will hold off a little
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
too yeah Mr chairman I just wanted to
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
mention you know given that tie that tie
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
is effectively in s sp12 because while
 
00:39:44.829 --> 00:39:44.839 align:start position:0%
we're putting a moratorium in um you
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
know you and removing rent it's not like
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
if that passes you can suddenly you know
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
what I mean it's already tied it's
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
already so if that's why that's why I
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
was thinking about it saying we'll hold
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
off on that because it's part of the
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
larger discussion at the end right okay
 
00:40:01.319 --> 00:40:02.309 align:start position:0%
larger discussion at the end right okay
thank

00:40:02.309 --> 00:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
you all right so let's anything else on
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
on those okay so uh last meeting Charlie
 
00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.430 align:start position:0%
on those okay so uh last meeting Charlie
handed

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
handed
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
out this
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
document we never really went through it
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
which is kind of like it really it
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
covers main massachusett Rhode Island
 
00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire and pairs them uh what
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
those States have
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
States but I don't know the folks bring
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
those with them good yep yep with the
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.109 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:50.839 align:start position:0%
so I just I just thought we could go
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
through this real quick Charlie
 
00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:56.740 align:start position:0%
um first off what's a racino
 
00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.390 align:start position:0%
um first off what's a racino
[Laughter]

00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's a term of Art in the industry
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
where based on the having been a track
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
horse track mostly before sometimes Dog
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
Tracks the operat the owner operator is
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
able to get machines and it's often used
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
to to support the
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
indigenous racing industry for example
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
like a Kentucky or
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
um um West Virginia it was actually used
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
West Virginia casinos part of their
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
requirement is that they fund dog racing
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
in West Virginia in fact West Virginia
 
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
is the only state in the US that still
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
has live dog racing and it was used to
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
fund and part of the requirement to get
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
the license to open a casino is you
 
00:41:46.109 --> 00:41:46.119 align:start position:0%
spend seven figures supporting dog
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
racing in the state that's sort of what
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
a Racino is so that was Hollywood Casino
 
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
and correct and similar to Oxford Casino
 
00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
had been a racetrack by Mr Bear right uh
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
and which he sold to churel Downs Church
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
Downs now owns that facility right
 
00:42:04.359 --> 00:42:08.069 align:start position:0%
Downs now owns that facility right
okay

00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh so we have main key if we go to main
 
00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.550 align:start position:0%
uh so we have main key if we go to main
key

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
key
 
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
facts uh it seems like every state taxes
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
differently every state uh and then
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts of course they figured out
 
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
how to tax every little thing you know
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
everybody has their fingers in who's
 
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.710 align:start position:0%
 
Maine

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh did this Define the difference
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
between the gross slot revenue and the
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
net I think I know what it is but can
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
well I actually don't know it but I'm
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
sorry this was prepared for by one of
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
the folks I work with in terms so I
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
actually don't know how I'm being
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
defines it because that would matter i'
 
00:42:58.109 --> 00:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
have to check with them and he's not
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
here right now he's not here right now
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
no I know net slot income is what's left
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
at the um in the machine at the end of
 
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
the day in terms of what is gets divied
 
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
up uh and how that gets divied up Maine
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
as I recall has about
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
seven tributaries off of their revenue
 
00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
as to where the money goes and I have to
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
bring them for you get them for you I
 
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
literally just did this as sort of
 
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
something as a reference point I wasn't
 
00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:23.079 align:start position:0%
happy to have gone through it um a
 
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
little more detailed but not prepared to
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
do it today right
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
okay um and then you give a table of
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
what the total taxes
 
00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.470 align:start position:0%
what the total taxes
are

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
um but then on top of the taxes and this
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
something that that we don't have in New
 
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire correct me if I'm wrong I mean
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
we have license
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
fees for certain things but I'm sure
 
00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:52.559 align:start position:0%
there just reasonable license fees yeah
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
there's no commas H there are no commas
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
in license fees no
 
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
no uh but in Maine you want a casino
 
00:44:04.549 --> 00:44:04.559 align:start position:0%
operator's license that's 225,000
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
what's a what's a slot machine
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
distributor license if you distributor
 
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
of slot machines right so it would be
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
answorth Konami so if they Wonder all so
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
so if they if they want to do business
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
in Maine that's
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
$200,000 and well these are annual or
 
00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.510 align:start position:0%
$200,000 and well these are annual or
this

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
I guess the casino operator licensees an
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
initial and then and then future years
 
00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:34.559 align:start position:0%
right yeah so if you looked on the table
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
Yeah renewal renewals Z 75,000
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
yep we don't have any of that correct
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay like I said there are there are
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
fees I think the license fee Val come
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
wrong for operator is
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
$750 yeah
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
$750 for an operator
 
00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:56.250 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh
 
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:59.349 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh
[Music]

00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
um table game fees 100,000 you know okay
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
so that's just one example main um
 
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which invents every tax in
 
00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:11.910 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which invents every tax in
the

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
world um they have three casinos we know
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
all know about Encore and the
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
Springfield location and then they
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
basically have a a a slot paror I would
 
00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
call it uh plane ridge they still just
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
slot machines there yes right
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
um so let's go through the
 
00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:39.109 align:start position:0%
um so let's go through the
numbers

00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
um so just just for comparison I mean
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
Encore I guess Encore in uh in the
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
Springfield their initial fee was 85
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
million yeah yep
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh but and they also had a guarantee
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
that their minimum investment that
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to build a nice facility
 
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
was $500 million hotel with
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
Hotel um so there were certain
 
00:46:17.069 --> 00:46:17.079 align:start position:0%
restrictions in it and then a tax of 25%
 
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
on on net slot machine and table gain
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
revenues yeah it also if I recall
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
correctly there's also a requirement
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
that the Juris get something too U from
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
each of those as well but there's a
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a takeout for them as
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
well it's a couple of percent per I
 
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
think it's three for the host and 1% for
 
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
the surrounding so that they can deal
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
with the social issues and pay
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
lake in the category two license looks
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
like it's just slot is a plane field
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah so plane field just for
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
slot machines was prage was uh $25
 
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
million up front and minimum investment
 
00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.630 align:start position:0%
million up front and minimum investment
125

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
125
 
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.030 align:start position:0%
125
million

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
um actually it was their ones saw
 
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
Garfield of Simon and gar Garfunkle s
 
00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.589 align:start position:0%
Garfield of Simon and gar Garfunkle s
golle

00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
golle
 
00:47:14.599 --> 00:47:16.670 align:start position:0%
golle
fame

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
fame
 
00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
um I I didn't play the machines but I
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
wanted the event there uh and then
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
there's 49% net on the uh on the net
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
slot machine
 
00:47:28.319 --> 00:47:30.750 align:start position:0%
slot machine
income

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
so Pat can I ask a question yeah sure
 
00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:34.839 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be for Aaron because
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's a gaming operator question so
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
interesting I'm looking at Massachusetts
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
facts I look at encor I look at MGM
 
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
Springfield right two two significant
 
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
casinos one seems to almost have an
 
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
equal distribution between slot revenue
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to for our purposes
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
consider that HHR revenue and table gain
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
revenue right they're they're pretty
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
evenly divided and then you go to MGM
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
and it's nowhere near it's the table
 
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
games are one quarter is that having to
 
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
do with marketing the operator what
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're looking for in a player and what
 
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559 align:start position:0%
we what they're emphasizing in their
 
00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
facility or is that just happen to be a
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
weird coincidence um you know I can't
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
answer that off the top of my head but a
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
lot of it has to do with the
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
demographics and table games players
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
usually eat at more highend restaurants
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
lot machine players
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
buffets um the Asian demographic which
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
Boston assuming has a lot more tends to
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
lean towards table games versus um I
 
00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:31.559 align:start position:0%
know it's a lot smaller in Springfield
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a bunch of factors all
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
build that thank
 
00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:41.589 align:start position:0%
build that thank
you

00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
okay and then then there's a
 
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
whole there's a whole slew of
 
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts there's a whole slew of
 
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.950 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts there's a whole slew of
other

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.710 align:start position:0%
other
fees

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
um and monies that have to go to places
 
00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
here I'm not quite sure I know you
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
didn't pull this together Charlie
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
but uh regulatory
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
costs is that above the percentage from
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
the from the games in the in the slot
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
machines no I think that that's the the
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
budget of the gaming commission I do
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
know that there's an additional tax on
 
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
machines in Massachusetts which is $600
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
per machine per year I think that's what
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
it goes towards if I recall
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
correctly okay so you look down there's
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
a per EG e g under the mass law it's
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
defined as an electronic gaming device
 
00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
if I recall correctly every law
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
considers the machine not every law
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
there are variances amongst laws as to
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
what it's called sometimes it's called a
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
video Lottery terminal some it's called
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
the you know uh EGD R so it's called HHR
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh that just it varies by the definition
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
of of the
 
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.510 align:start position:0%
of of the
statute

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
okay again there's a there's a variety
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
of of fees here above and beyond the
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
normal tax I guess is what it said
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:08.710 align:start position:0%
 
Island

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.079 --> 00:50:20.910 align:start position:0%
 
tton

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
um so again Charlie what's it what's it
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
they have rter they called video Lottery
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
terminals correct um Rhode Island is a
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
story unto itself um that would take me
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
a long time to explain um IGT which is
 
00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:40.799 align:start position:0%
the biggest I think still either the
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
first or second biggest slot
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer in the world is also the
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
biggest lottery vendor in the world is
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
the biggest employer in Rhode
 
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
Island and so um they have
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
a they're very influential on the State
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
House of Rhode Island they've had the
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island contract for lottery and
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
for the systems at the casinos for
 
00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
effort um and they just renewed for 20
 
00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
years based on the terms you have here
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
so they they've been a this it's just
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
been a state that's embraced gambling
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.079 --> 00:51:24.349 align:start position:0%
 
time

00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
okay say the extension to 2043 yeah
 
00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
correct they had previously had a
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
2023 and they they they have again just
 
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
m it too they they want to make sure
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
that there's investment into these
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
facilities to make
 
00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
them probably
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
multifaceted facilities I would
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
imagine um yeah Twin Rivers had actually
 
00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
prior to we been a racetrack as
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
well and so it had the remnants of the
 
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
racetrack just didn't look particularly
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
nice and they wanted to upgrade
 
00:52:05.599 --> 00:52:07.349 align:start position:0%
nice and they wanted to upgrade
those

00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
okay all right so
 
00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
again it's there's a lot of apples and
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
oranges between the
 
00:52:16.079 --> 00:52:18.390 align:start position:0%
oranges between the
states

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and that we've got a and then there's
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
a whole section here on New
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um
 
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
basically we're we're looking at 14
 
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
right now tend to have historic racing
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
machines uh and sports book is at seat
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
book Manchester over in ashaa
 
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
correct and then s cast is it
 
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.750 align:start position:0%
correct and then s cast is it
work

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
um we know about the 10% 35% and all
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
that but then just a nice table at the
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
end here but with the uh
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
as of the caly Year
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
22 for this six there were at the time
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
there were 16 locations I guess now
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
they're down to
 
00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
14 that correct yeah sorry two the two
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
Keen locations merged okay and it was it
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
it was last year right yeah that's right
 
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.829 align:start position:0%
it was last year right yeah that's right
yeah

00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
um and you can see in the chart I mean
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
in total gross
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
revenues um total gross resue was all
 
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
for one year was
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
73 call it 74
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
million of which the commission share
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
does that mean is that the state who's
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
the commission yeah that's us yeah yeah
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
the state 8 8.6 million and then the
 
00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.910 align:start position:0%
the state 8 8.6 million and then the
charities

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
charities
 
00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
benefited 20.5
 
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
million and the the G the uh goes which
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
are the owners of these facilities um
 
00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
again this is their
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
gr not their net revenue this is their
 
00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
gross revenue before expenses 44.6
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
million so um I mean there's a this's a
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
good little chart to get a sense of the
 
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:22.870 align:start position:0%
good little chart to get a sense of the
wide

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
wide
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
range of size of the facil
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
ities if if you if you look at if you
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
look at them they're smaller ones Mr
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
chairman if I could certainly I'm happy
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
to update these numbers the next meeting
 
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
because we will have calendar year
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
presuming we not have a meeting before
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
Christmas uh for calendar year 23 as
 
00:54:44.589 --> 00:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.599 --> 00:54:49.069 align:start position:0%
 
great

00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:56.150 align:start position:0%
 
document

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
shows you how these states I mean they
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
they they micro this I mean you know we
 
00:55:04.349 --> 00:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
tend to send money to the general fund
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
or send it to the education trust fund
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
or whatever here the earmark there's a
 
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
lot of ear marking going on with where
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
the money
 
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
goes I mean they a mark the city of
 
00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:17.720 align:start position:0%
Bangor gets 1% they
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
get um you know we may we may get to
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
that by the way as we discuss this uh
 
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
that because there is some discussion
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
that that some of these these fac especi
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
facilities get
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
larger that some of these communities
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
are saying hey you know it's costing us
 
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
money to to
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh provide police uh coverage in the
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
evening some
 
00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.670 align:start position:0%
evening some
nighttime

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
nighttime
 
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
um I mean they I me they got things like
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
05% goes to the main milk
 
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
pool 0.15% goes to main Maritime Academy
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
you know they really
 
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
earmark um things
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
and then Massachusetts
 
00:56:01.029 --> 00:56:01.039 align:start position:0%
is actually that Maine was even more so
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
than than ma massachus your
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
marks I mean yeah say 40% goes to the
 
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:12.390 align:start position:0%
education trust
fund

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh this two and a half% goes to the
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
racehorse Development Fund um I don't
 
00:56:20.349 --> 00:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
know they do they still have do they
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
still have live
 
00:56:25.029 --> 00:56:25.039 align:start position:0%
racing didn't they close the one yeah
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
there was um that they're closed there's
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.549 --> 00:56:35.559 align:start position:0%
racing so
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
again as far as I know we all the EX's
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
all right now all the excess State
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
money goes to the education trust
 
00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.950 align:start position:0%
money goes to the education trust
fund

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
that yeah I I
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
think I think the pictures a little bit
 
00:56:58.829 --> 00:56:58.839 align:start position:0%
different because um in New Hampshire
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is we're
 
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
allocating the revenues that aren't
 
00:57:09.029 --> 00:57:09.039 align:start position:0%
going to be kept by The Operators to the
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
general fund but also to
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
Charities and so there's a big chunk of
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
money that's going to Charities and no
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
other state is doing that but they're
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of other things and that's
 
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
the long list we're seeing under
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and so forth
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I wanted to say is
 
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
this is exactly the information that I
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
hope the consultant that gets the job
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
helps us um sort through and separate
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
and be able to compare apples to apples
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
and oranges to oranges because it's hard
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
right now and so um New Hampshire
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a big LIC licensing fee and
 
00:57:56.589 --> 00:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
access to the entitlement to to operate
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
these facilities but
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
um we've got other things and other
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
states are getting a lot of money so
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
people say to me well why aren't we
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
getting $25 million for you know for the
 
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
next historic course racing machine
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
operator that's going to have a thousand
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
machines let's say and so forth um we've
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
got to be able to sort through um this
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
I think that there is one other
 
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
state when would when Delaware began
 
00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
this process and Delaware was what the
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
they were the initial entry and they had
 
00:58:40.029 --> 00:58:40.039 align:start position:0%
three tracks They had Delaware Park they
 
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
had they had do downs and Harington
 
00:58:44.829 --> 00:58:44.839 align:start position:0%
they're still running those three tracks
 
00:58:47.789 --> 00:58:47.799 align:start position:0%
are still running uh two years ago or
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
three years ago pressure was put on
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
Delaware to put charitable gabing into
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
all of these facilities so they that
 
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
have charitable gaming they still have I
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
think they still maintain the initial
 
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
situation that existed the big the big
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
ticket items cost but there is a
 
00:59:07.029 --> 00:59:07.039 align:start position:0%
charitable gam component I don't know
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
how that's handled but the woman who
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
runs the delw lottery is a full of
 
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
Representative uh and uh heled uh I
 
00:59:19.029 --> 00:59:19.039 align:start position:0%
don't know what hel's last name is but
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
but anyway she runs and I'm in contact
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
with but I know that they have
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
charitable gabing so at least there's
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
there's somebody who we can look at who
 
00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:31.720 align:start position:0%
deals with charitable gabing in the true
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
sense of the word charitable gabing uh I
 
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
don't know how many other states have it
 
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
as as as we do but it in in Delaware it
 
00:59:46.829 --> 00:59:46.839 align:start position:0%
sits upon an organization that began
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
with with the lottery becoming the place
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
where gaming was expanded bines at the
 
00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
at the track
 
00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
dollarss allocated for horse
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
racing uh uh at at doels there's a car
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
track that that's there so they take
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
care of they take care of that they
 
01:00:09.789 --> 01:00:09.799 align:start position:0%
still maintain standard bread racing
 
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
there and Harington is a fair type of
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
situation which would be more more more
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
like an agrarian situation all right
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's the southern part of of
 
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
the of the T but there's a good example
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
for us to look at of an existing
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
situation that then Place charitable gam
 
01:00:33.549 --> 01:00:33.559 align:start position:0%
on top of it and what's happened as a
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
result of that what the Charities get
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
versus what's the the general the
 
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
general situation with regarding the
 
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
watery and how much do the watery takes
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
out of this and and with where the money
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
goes there because when you look at
 
01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
what's in place at our sister
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
States you you look at the the initial
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
cost to get into the business and
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
getting into the business is quite
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
expensive it's a multi-billion dollar
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
situation for us to get in the business
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's what
 
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
$575 or something like that $750
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
$750 compared to 35 billion there's a
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
huge differential there and that that
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
certainly shows up a bit of better here
 
01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
but on the other side the Charities if
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
you look at what the charities can't
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
here versus there is there aren't any
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
Charities the other jurisdictions other
 
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
than the one that I articulated on
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
Delaware so when you when you give it 20
 
01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
billion to Charities based on the
 
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
numbers that we've seen here uh $2
 
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
billion is a lot of money it's it's a
 
01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
money and we're going to have to look at
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
that because anything that disturbs that
 
01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
would be problematic I I think you know
 
01:01:55.799 --> 01:01:57.430 align:start position:0%
would be problematic I I think you know
quite

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
quite
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
problematic yes Tim so I'm I'm assuming
 
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
we're just talking now about General
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue and revenue sharing and how that
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
Revenue sharing is occurring and as I
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
said in the RFP process the state takes
 
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
a unique process and we take that 35%
 
01:02:14.829 --> 01:02:14.839 align:start position:0%
and give it to Charities we just choose
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
not to do the individual allocations
 
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
we're letting the operators pick the
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
Charities and do those Charities but but
 
01:02:23.269 --> 01:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
make no mistake that un that's still a
 
01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:26.839 align:start position:0%
state required expense or or Draw out of
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
funds that are happening for an operator
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about percentages
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
and what percentages look like the
 
01:02:35.309 --> 01:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
effective rate if you combine HHR and
 
01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
and games of chance the effective tax
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
rate is
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
35% right that's our effective tax rate
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
that we're requiring out of the revenues
 
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
that the that operators make and
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
understand that out of the remaining 66%
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
The Operators keep they still have to
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
pay business profits tax they still got
 
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
to pay business Enterprise tax so I'm
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
not even sure that 35% is an effective
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
rate when you add in all those other um
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
taxes they have to pay that they get to
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
the state local property taxes that go
 
01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
into that as well that come out of their
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
66% so I'm hoping as we talk about this
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
and what that really looks like I I
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to walk around walk out of
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
here thinking that the operators are
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
stealing right they that they're just
 
01:03:15.309 --> 01:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
making money hand over fist because
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
there are a lot more requirements and a
 
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
lot more um expenses that are on the
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
other side and I'm not justifying
 
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
anything other than just to make that
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
statement to make sure we're clear when
 
01:03:26.829 --> 01:03:26.839 align:start position:0%
we talk about our numbers right they
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
have a just on their base gross revenue
 
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
absent all those other expenses they
 
01:03:33.789 --> 01:03:33.799 align:start position:0%
have a 35% tax rate on on their revenues
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
and then on top of that they have all
 
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
those local things and all the other
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
state taxes they've got to pay um and so
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
their effective tax rate is probably
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
much higher than that than it would be
 
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
for other businesses in the same you
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
know just a regular business so I I just
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're taking into
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
account that whole big picture of what
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
that looks like I I look at the 35% they
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
do for charitable gain ging on the on
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
the games of chance side is basically
 
01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.349 align:start position:0%
the games of chance side is basically
the

01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
state saying we're not going to
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
micromanage this we're going to let you
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
deal with it right we're going to just
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
make let you do the grants locally and
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
and and not have to have that at the
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
stakes I can't imagine the finance
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
committee having to figure that out um
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
and so uh and distributing those funds
 
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
so as as we're looking at this I just
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're taking a
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
holistic look at everything and the
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
revenues and the fees being charged to
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
operators um that are Beyond just as
 
01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
simple what what what's the split look
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
like right and understand that I was
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
just going to say uh it's actually 35
 
01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
plus 10 the state so 45 tot right so
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
understand our goal is to look we're not
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
taking anybody's side on this we're
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
saying what's fair to the state what's
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
fair to the organizations that have
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
facilities that have offered these games
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
and what's fair to the
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
Charities and and that's what we're
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
trying to get at uh we're not saying
 
01:04:52.349 --> 01:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
that it's not fair
 
01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:56.839 align:start position:0%
now uh but we don't know uh so we're
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we're going to bring these
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
consultants in help us at least compare
 
01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
as best we can apples to apples to make
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
sure that we're uh you know we are we're
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
being fair look we're not going to
 
01:05:11.549 --> 01:05:11.559 align:start position:0%
dismantle charitable gaming in the state
 
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
no way I mean charitable gaming is here
 
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
to stay and I I know they cars me say
 
01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
this all the time but but it's here
 
01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
today day but it's changed so much that
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
we've we
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's good that we have this Commission
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
because we need to pause and look at at
 
01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
kind of what's going on in the industry
 
01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:35.559 align:start position:0%
here uh we we really don't have any
 
01:05:37.269 --> 01:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
there's only one local owner at this
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
point of all all of them which is fine
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
they're outside
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
owners uh but that's all happened in the
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
last five years where it's it's all
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
changed on us I mean uh and and the
 
01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
whole issue of how many and all of that
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know we can all be free market types
 
01:05:58.269 --> 01:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
and say let the let the market dictate
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
it and uh but you know I don't think all
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
the existing CH locations are really
 
01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
going to be excited about that um
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
but or we could say look let's limit it
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh clearly everybody's going to want to
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
be in the Southern Tier because that's
 
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
what the population
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
is uh but you know maybe we want we want
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
to help more Charities up in North
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
Country and the way we can do that by
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
having more facilities up North so maybe
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
we need to weigh in some of those issues
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
as we as we talked you know maybe maybe
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
Geographic allocation of some of these
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
up north do you want to weigh in on
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
that yes I want you know one of
 
01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
the Geniuses if you want here that out
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
the charal gaming is really distribution
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at that the various other
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
states it goes to government government
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
is taking this and government says these
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
are the good
 
01:06:59.710 --> 01:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
programs with our charal gaming the uh
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
various um organizations if you want are
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
are going over sponsoring 10 days a year
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
but it's going to that little
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
organization if you want okay unknown
 
01:07:14.349 --> 01:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
one that cares for maybe uh Sisters of
 
01:07:16.589 --> 01:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
the blind if you want okay they've got
 
01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
15 volunteers who are putting in
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
countless hours if you want in there but
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
only part of those hours again have been
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
trying to fundraise all of a sudden that
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
$5,000 possibly comes in because they
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
were sponsor H go over Revitalize their
 
01:07:38.589 --> 01:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
their the organization and I can go over
 
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
and provide more service and it's those
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
unknown ones that th those particular
 
01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:44.750 align:start position:0%
unknown ones that th those particular
small

01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:07:47.789 --> 01:07:47.799 align:start position:0%
organizations uh can go to a can knock a
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
Delaware NS if you want door it say hi
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
this is our Delaware North looks at it H
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
not worth it okay we'd rather give our
 
01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
our money to the cancer fund to the uh
 
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
to the big names again you get the
 
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
recognition so it's it's those small
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
ones that really end up by
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
multiplying if you want those dollars
 
01:08:15.189 --> 01:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
because even the local
 
01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:17.719 align:start position:0%
communities are don't have budgets to go
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
over and necessarily fund that
 
01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.030 align:start position:0%
over and necessarily fund that
particular

01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
organizations um services so that those
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
kind of Fall by the wayside because
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
they're small and our teral gaming goes
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
over and is able to go over and address
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
some of those and I would certainly
 
01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
agree that the North country you know
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
again has got to be looked at but the
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
North Country organizations can apply if
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
you want and sponsor if you want the um
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh 10 days in Nash in Salem Manchester
 
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
if you want they're not the the sponsors
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
are not limited as to where they are in
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
the state that just have to be a chable
 
01:09:00.839 --> 01:09:02.950 align:start position:0%
the state that just have to be a chable
organization

01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.470 align:start position:0%
organization
right

01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to spend the rest of the the
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
day talking about the Charities because
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
that's basically why we're
 
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
handout and then I also invited we have
 
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
an invited guest here today
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
um Kathleen Reen who will introduce in a
 
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
minute uh I just want to start the
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
Charities and uh I'm not saying again
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
this is to me this is all a blank sheet
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
of paper um we don't necessarily want to
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
we're helping a lot of Charities now
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
there's no question about it um
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
Charities are making over
 
01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.470 align:start position:0%
Charities are making over
$100,000

01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
$100,000
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
today uh
 
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hard to say to them well
 
01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to pull a rug out from
 
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
you going
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
forward uh but I had a few thoughts
 
01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
about just to get the conversation going
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
and then we'll hear from Mr
 
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
R uh about our Charities and it's um I
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
mean the question of who selects the
 
01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
Charities who schedules the
 
01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
Charities maximum maximum number of days
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
per charity we know it's
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
10 uh in statute but doesn't mean every
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
charity gets 10 days currently it's up
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
to the facility some facilities don't
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
give they give seven days well they may
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
say we only G give you five or we have
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
three extra days who wants the three
 
01:10:36.239 --> 01:10:37.270 align:start position:0%
three extra days who wants the three
extra

01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
extra
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
days um the obligation of the
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
charity we could say well well it's just
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
random we're picking Charities but if I
 
01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
was a facility why why wouldn't I select
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
a charity to be in my portfolio
 
01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.910 align:start position:0%
a charity to be in my portfolio
charities

01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
charities
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
um because they actually work it they
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
bring they bring people in because
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
they're promoting they do a good job of
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
promoting the event that the the 10 days
 
01:11:07.149 --> 01:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:11:07.159 --> 01:11:09.110 align:start position:0%
that they
have

01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
uh and then it was brought up about the
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh daily posting of Charities at the
 
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
facilities I think who was it
 
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
represented brudy did you bring that one
 
01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
up last time about about some of the
 
01:11:25.149 --> 01:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
Charities not properly posted saying the
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.709 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
right right so then
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um the categories of
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
Charities I mean there's different
 
01:12:02.629 --> 01:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
missions different sizes different
 
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
needs that I can see Charlie provided
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
the great list of all the Charities that
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
are being helped right now that are
 
01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
participating and it's a wide broad list
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
of Charities all over the
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
place you know can we categorize those
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
Charities into different groups I was
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
told by potential new Charities that
 
01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
want to be involved when I said well you
 
01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
know you can make a 100 you can make 100
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
if you pick the right facility and they
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
they accept you and you get 10 days you
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
can make a hundred
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
$100,000 they go wow we don't need that
 
01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:36.350 align:start position:0%
$100,000 they go wow we don't need that
much

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
money uh is there again this is all
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
thinking out loud here uh in terms of do
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
we even want to touch the way things are
 
01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
done with the Charities or not um but
 
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
again it's it's a charity is not a
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
charity it's not a charity
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
either um
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
but then how do we accommodate more
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
Charities this is the the problem we got
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
is that as more more Charities find out
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
about this more and more Charities want
 
01:13:06.669 --> 01:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
to be involved now at least we did with
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines is we doubled
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
the number of Charities two two
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
Charities sponsoring one
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
date and by the way a facility can't
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
open unless they have the sponsors there
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
which is different than any other state
 
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
any other location that you can't open
 
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
for business if you don't have a sponsor
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh by a charity so it's really in a way
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
the charity is the kind of weing the dog
 
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
a little
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
bit I mean it's just the way it was been
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
structured I mean that's the way it is
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
no charities no you can't
 
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
open and then uh and then any sealing on
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
annual winnings my concern is if if some
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
of the facilities
 
01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.229 align:start position:0%
of the facilities
grow

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
grow
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know everybody's going to want
 
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
those that that facility to have dates
 
01:14:02.189 --> 01:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
if it's only two dates my gosh you
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
know should there be some kind of a
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
ceiling and I again we're not going to
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
hurt again I would not do anything here
 
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
that was going to hurt any existing
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
Charities uh that that have done a good
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
job all these years I don't think we
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
have to we have we have to make sure
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
that and that's what we did by historic
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
racing by and the way we phased in
 
01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
historic racing we made sure we
 
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
protected the the Legacy Charities that
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
were already
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
involved uh
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
but um but you know there's going to
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
come a point
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
where there there 100,000 or is it
 
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
125,000 should there be a ceiling I'm
 
01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
posing this as a question I don't
 
01:14:44.199 --> 01:14:46.629 align:start position:0%
posing this as a question I don't
know

01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
but is going to come a time that is it
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
better to is it better to say that
 
01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
we limit the days from 10 is that a way
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
you control this to to make sure but
 
01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
like let's let's pick a
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
um look as as some of these Charities
 
01:15:09.149 --> 01:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
grow and they add more
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
machines because we have no restrictions
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
on how many they can add if they decide
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
to add another wing and um and we still
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
have only two dates I mean so now the
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
existing charities make
 
01:15:24.159 --> 01:15:26.629 align:start position:0%
existing charities make
150,000

01:15:26.629 --> 01:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
150,000
 
01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
160,000 uh or is it better to say well
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
let's share the
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
wealth and open it up to more Charities
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
again a way you can do that is by
 
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
reducing the days statutorily from 10 to
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
8 or something like that so this is all
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
open open questions for me uh that we
 
01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
have to deal with as a group here so I
 
01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
just wanted to start that thought
 
01:15:53.709 --> 01:15:53.719 align:start position:0%
process going here
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
by having my short list here of things
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh not that we're going to accomplish
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
that today but what I I'd like to do is
 
01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
to ask Kathleen Reen who's the uh chair
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
or the president the
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
chair of the
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh of the New Hampshire Center for
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofits thank you can just say one
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
thing so two things on that is that I
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
also want to remind everybody that the
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
statute doesn't require 10 days statute
 
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
is up to 10 days operator could split
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
their week up if they chose to and have
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
smaller Charities have two days a week
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
and have M five charities in a 10-day
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
period rather than one so by Statute
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
they already have the flexibility
 
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
operators too to be able to work with
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
smaller Charities if they want to and
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
break up the revenue stream in a
 
01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
different manner um and then on top of
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
that again I just we do have
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions on the number of machines
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
they can have and we do that by the
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
revenue ratio
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
so um so I so we do have a metric that
 
01:16:58.510 --> 01:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
we could control the number of machines
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
that metric is through the revenue
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
ratios and but I can I can add a wing
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
and add more table games too right sure
 
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
but you also have to make the revenue on
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
those table games so you can't if you
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
put the wing in you don't make any money
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
you can't increase your HHR
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
machines Mr chair I'd like to mention as
 
01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
a charity representative as well that
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
the Charities when we doubled up started
 
01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
making at least where we benefit made
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
less the following year once they
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
doubled up because the even though we're
 
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
tier one it still didn't make up for it
 
01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
in revenue from the expansion let's say
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
of the machines right so the doubling up
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
that comes into account and where I work
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
as well there's about 10 Charities that
 
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
I had that ended up benefiting somewhere
 
01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
else because of the doubling up of the
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
Charities if any charity is not
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
benefiting I would urge them to reach
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
out to any room because they're all
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
looking and they're actually scooping up
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
from each other to get Charities on the
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
list in order to be compliant and be
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
said say say that char No So to that
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
point um you're gonna get a saturation
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
point of Charities that want to
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
engage like we're almost to the point of
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
if we were to double the number of rooms
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
we couldn't meet the number of Charities
 
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
like level okay well this was an
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
interesting uh
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
sorry uh um fine you know actually there
 
01:18:29.159 --> 01:18:30.709 align:start position:0%
sorry uh um fine you know actually there
are

01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
Charities that are don't want to raise
 
01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
money through gaming I mean it's just a
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
reality so okay well with that uh M Ren

prices in order to support we need to
 
01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:57.239 align:start position:0%

01:23:59.470 --> 01:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
source and contracts with government and
 
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:01.719 align:start position:0%
philanthropy which often don't cover the

01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
come in so that you can hear um from
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
their experience about how charitable
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
gaming supports them we begun reaching
 
01:24:19.950 --> 01:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
out to some of our members and we would
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
invite a group here that would represent
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
the diversity of mission the diversity
 
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
of geography um working with different
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
game operators as well as the size of
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
the organization so you can understand
 
01:24:34.510 --> 01:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
how important it is to various um
 
01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:35.470 align:start position:0%
how important it is to various um
Revenue

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
mixes as this commission reviews
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
potential changes to charitable gaming
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
laws I urge you to keep in
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
mind that gaming exists in New Hampshire
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
to support our Charities that is the
 
01:24:51.870 --> 01:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
regulational construct that was passed
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
um and these Charities these very
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
Charities are so important to our states
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
and our communities thank
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you for that um let
 
01:25:07.149 --> 01:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
so of your Charities that you represent
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh what what perent would you say are
 
01:25:16.590 --> 01:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
adverse to charitable gaming in terms of
 
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
just because it's it's
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
gambling um or that that they all
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
would like to see Char gaming uh
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
enhanced even more I I don't have data
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
about what charities positions are I
 
01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
think you can see that a number of
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
Charities have seen that revenue is an
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
important part of their mix um certainly
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
every every charity would you know have
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
that conversation with their board about
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
how that aligns with their mission
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
um okay so do
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
you um in terms of knowledge about
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming is it safe to say that
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
your membership is well aware of
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming that it
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
exists um I think that a lot of
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
Charities are aware of that and there's
 
01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
more education um we we had a forum uh
 
01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
last Friday in which we talked about
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming and um representative
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
from the commission came as well and
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
talked about it so it is something that
 
01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
not every organization knows how to
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
access um but you know there's broad
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
awareness increasing awareness of it as
 
01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:28.310 align:start position:0%
awareness increasing awareness of it as
a

01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
option thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um just in
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
general um the 700 members of the New
 
01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.590 align:start position:0%
general um the 700 members of the New
Hampshire

01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
Center are we using the word nonprofit
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
and charity synonymously is every
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofit a
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
charity it so in terms of the 7,000
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
number the 7,000 nonprofits are the five
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire are 501c3
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
is based in New Hampshire providing
 
01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
services in New Hampshire um the center
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
and our members includes nonprofits of
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
various types of nonprofits um the bulk
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
of them are charitable
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
nonprofits is that is that your question
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
does that address your question okay so
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so so it's not necessarily
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
synonymous a lot of nonprofits are
 
01:27:20.189 --> 01:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
Charities but not all not all nonprofits
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
are Charities not all not all nonprofits
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
are Charities but the vast majority are
 
01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
but there are like 20 different um sub
 
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
sectors of the of the
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
charitable um you know there's 51c 3s
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
and sixes and 19s and all of those and
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
this I don't I don't know all of the um
 
01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
this RSA charitable gaming is open
 
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
to I think six different types um so it
 
01:27:49.709 --> 01:27:49.719 align:start position:0%
is primarily charitable but like there's
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
five y Ma and cheating okay
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
but like veterans veterans groups are
 
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
you know have are not
 
01:27:59.470 --> 01:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
all corre eligible I think it's a
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
handful I get you the list if you want
 
01:28:05.229 --> 01:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
sorry no no yeah get you the list it's
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
not all of them but it's closely defined
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
I think we should all see yeah yeah so
 
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
we can we pull the RSC
 
01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.629 align:start position:0%
we can we pull the RSC
okay

01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
good um yeah actually question Charlie
 
01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
just CU I I want to make sure I'm
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
clearing it so again there's no
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
Geographic correlation but between a
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
charity and a gaming operator so someone
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
from Berlin can be working with nsha
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no n there's no
 
01:28:32.430 --> 01:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
required there's almost a natural one
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
though right obviously to come in but if
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
they the Charities can The Operators can
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
accept from anywhere in the state as
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
long as they meet the 50c requirement
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
correct correct thank you Fred Fred has
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
a question uh thank you Mr chair and
 
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question I'm just
 
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
pretty unfamiliar with your organization
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
is there a a resource that I can use to
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
see who the 700 plus members are we
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
folks started how you started that kind
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
of thing you have a website or something
 
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
yep we have a website nhn nonprofits.
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
org um and you can look at uh we have
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
our list of members is
 
01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
there as well as information about all
 
01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
of our programs and services that I
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
referenced quick
 
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
followup do you know off hand how many
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
of your members are currently engaged
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
with charitable
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
gaming I don't have that exact number no
 
01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.189 align:start position:0%
gaming I don't have that exact number no
guess

01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:29:31.629 --> 01:29:31.639 align:start position:0%
um how many how many Charities are
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
are present involved with presently
 
01:29:34.239 --> 01:29:36.990 align:start position:0%
are present involved with presently
involved

01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry there's a strong I I guess
 
01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
what I would say the max the minimum
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
would be 104 per
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
location no I I get that my question was
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
she she represents a group of Charities
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
or nonprofits and I'm wondering how many
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
of those are involved at present to to
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
your knowledge if you don't don't know
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
if we can find that out I'd be
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
you so my thought is
 
01:30:08.830 --> 01:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
that that the that the the commission
 
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
have a u additional public input from
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
Charities uh at some point maybe next
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
meeting or the meeting
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
after uh and I'd like to get a cross
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
section of the charities
 
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
and I was going to ask Miss W to help us
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
with that to give us a
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
cross-section um of the types of
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
facilities or Charities that are out
 
01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:35.390 align:start position:0%
facilities or Charities that are out
there

01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:30:38.669 --> 01:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
um um without objection is that okay
 
01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
with everybody so okay so uh any other
 
01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:45.870 align:start position:0%
with everybody so okay so uh any other
questions

01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
of just for clarity we we have two
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
members on the board here that on on the
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
commission that are representative of
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
the Charities are you saying a component
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
if I'm reading you right Mr chair a
 
01:31:03.109 --> 01:31:03.119 align:start position:0%
component from this group is going to I
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
mean I want to hear from
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
everybody well we can't hear from well
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
we can't hear from everybody well
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
there's 800 plus Charities that are
 
01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
actively involved I think we should hear
 
01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we can but you're not
 
01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
isolating Our Testimony to one group
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
presenting oh oh no no no no the no
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
individual Charities but what I'm
 
01:31:27.790 --> 01:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
looking for is a cross-section of
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
Charities you know I we don't you know I
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
don't want to hear from every Boys and
 
01:31:34.109 --> 01:31:34.119 align:start position:0%
Girls Club but one Boys and Girls Club
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.590 align:start position:0%
 
huh

01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
huh
 
01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
so would perhaps written testimony make
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
sense if we had some Charities maybe
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
write some written testimony and
 
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
everybody can kind of peruse over it not
 
01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:52.870 align:start position:0%
everybody can kind of peruse over it not
their

01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
pleasure yeah I I've been I was in
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
that but I would agree with said I'm
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
just questioning like how many want to
 
01:32:06.669 --> 01:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
have it's better to get people in front
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
of us okay to talk how many how many do
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
you have kind of in mind well if each
 
01:32:14.189 --> 01:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
could go five minutes and we given you
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
know like uh so open it up and give
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
everybody five about about maybe 10 to
 
01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
12 charities okay something like that
 
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
good to know thank
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
you well I guess our charity
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh I mean we have the I
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
mean we technically have the list of all
 
01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:33.470 align:start position:0%
mean we technically have the list of all
the

01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:37.109 --> 01:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
Charities uh so uh but I just wanted to
 
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
look for somebody who has a maybe our
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
two charity members can offer up some
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
thoughts about as well uh the a
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
cross-section of the kind of Charities
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
yeah hello mran uh can you give us an
 
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
idea maybe not today but in the future
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not your membership
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
looks at the current system as being
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
advantageous to their missions in other
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
words would they pre would they prefer a
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
situation where uh there is Mission
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
directed monies from charitable gaming
 
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
versus uh just the luck of the night so
 
01:33:23.629 --> 01:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
if one one charity gets a Wednesday
 
01:33:26.109 --> 01:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
night versus one getting a Saturday uh
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
and I know very little about the
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
statistics of this but if uh that uh
 
01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
that Wednesday night doesn't prove to be
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
a great night for gaming for whatever
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
reason but Saturday nights are fantastic
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh in some cases that might be the luck
 
01:33:42.510 --> 01:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
of the draw what I think we would like
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
to hear a little bit about is is the
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
actual Mission focused aspect of of
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
those monies and whether or not your
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
membership would prefer a system like
 
01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:53.590 align:start position:0%
membership would prefer a system like
that

01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
I think that's a a good reason to bring
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
some Charities here to hear directly
 
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
from them and we can certainly work on
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
on um on that as
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
well because I think the point is that
 
01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:08.430 align:start position:0%
well because I think the point is that
in

01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:34:13.229 --> 01:34:13.239 align:start position:0%
statute there's no direction as to other
 
01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
than maximum of 10
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
days there's no anything about make sure
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
everybody gets a weekend or you know and
 
01:34:24.669 --> 01:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
then you can say well we're we're
 
01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
leaving up the facilities we are leaving
 
01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
just right now we're leaving up
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
facilities to pick
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
which which Charities get which dates
 
01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
and we all know there are good dates and
 
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
there are bad
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
dates uh I think most of them work
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
towards the ones that I talk to trying
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
to balance it out a little bit that
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
everybody gets you know some weekday
 
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
dates and some weekend dates uh you know
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
dates that are
 
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
more which have been more profitable for
 
01:34:56.109 --> 01:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
everybody including the
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
Charities so uh but there's nothing in
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
statue that directs that I mean it's
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
just the way it works
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
um uh you know again as a commission is
 
01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
there something we want to delve into I
 
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to we're going to
 
01:35:13.470 --> 01:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
probably start delving into it a little
 
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
bit uh may not be that there's anything
 
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
different comes out the back end but I
 
01:35:19.709 --> 01:35:19.719 align:start position:0%
think we need to have the conversation
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
about that and I I think having the
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
charity you put would be very valuable
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
to all of us on that um uh but like I
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
said earlier you know all Charities
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
aren't created equal all Charities don't
 
01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
put as much effort into their dates in
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
terms of filling a room up with with
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
people saying promoting promoting their
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
dates hey we got these we got these 10
 
01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
Dates you know people who like boys and
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
girls club in
 
01:35:55.470 --> 01:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
wherever uh come on come on out to the
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
to whatever facility that's holding
 
01:36:01.149 --> 01:36:01.159 align:start position:0%
those dates and and help us out that way
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's the way this was originally
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
work that the Charities would sponsor
 
01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
the date when it used to be in the
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
church basement and the guy with the ru
 
01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
wheel came to the church
 
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
basement that charity was really
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
promoting the
 
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
date you know so so there's value in in
 
01:36:21.629 --> 01:36:21.639 align:start position:0%
that to me that the Charities are loing
 
01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
the date because it's helping everybody
 
01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
out and helps the state out too so uh so
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
again I'm just trying to go from where
 
01:36:33.390 --> 01:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
we were to where we are
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
today and as to what the philosophies
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
are here um as we as we move forward um
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
you know what do we think that we need
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
to adjust our statutes accordingly but
 
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh that that's to be
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
seen um Mr chair just to as a chair to
 
01:36:54.510 --> 01:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
speak to the weekend comment typically
 
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
we get seven days and it includes a
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
Monday to Sunday just for licensing
 
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
posting and those purposes it makes
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
sense to have them be in order um and
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
then typically if you do get up to 10
 
01:37:09.070 --> 01:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
maybe one gets two weekends maybe one
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
gets one but I think everybody for the
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
most part and the lottery could speak
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
better to it with other rooms and
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
experiences but typically everybody gets
 
01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.109 align:start position:0%
experiences but typically everybody gets
a

01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
weekend Charlie yeah certainly if looked
 
01:37:23.709 --> 01:37:23.719 align:start position:0%
at the reports that were sent two
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
meetings ago last meeting you'll see the
 
01:37:28.109 --> 01:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
revenue the revenue generally reflects
 
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
the days you
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
got and so um if you they're all by done
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
by room all that report so you can see
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
which sort of are even and which are not
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
self-evident so again I guess what I'm
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing from Charities
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
about is again are there Charities or
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
have that had a difficulty and what was
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
that difficulty and is it a legislative
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
solution or just a operational problem
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
right so um I mean I think again for the
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
most part the up the the Charities are
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
are fairing well under charitable gaming
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
but the question is what are we missing
 
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
right so those people that had problems
 
01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
wanted a date couldn't get a date people
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
who uh feel like they were short changed
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
in some way shape or form um let's have
 
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
those conversations and find out what
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
bring that to the light let's have that
 
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
conversation see if it's a statutory
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
problem or regulatory problem that that
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
this commission needs to look at but I I
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm struggling to see if we
 
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
just have 10 or 12 Charities show up and
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
say nope things are great what's the
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee can I ask this question would
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
it make sense for us to send out a
 
01:38:47.229 --> 01:38:47.239 align:start position:0%
um questionnaire sort of Survey Monkey
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
type thing we have all the email
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
addresses I
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
think by and large um a series of
 
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
questions and get back responses that
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
seems to be more of a broad-based sort
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
of res a great starting point to get
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
summary of the you know 800 Charities
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
that are out there and what their
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
experience has been working with the
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
operators I mean there are certain folks
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
that you know just don't have email I
 
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
think but yeah by and large I think we
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
could do that pretty
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
effectively okay that's that makes a lot
 
01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
of sense so
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
s Charlie would you need some help with
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
creating the questions you I don't think
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
so certainly um I we do this a lot for
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
lots of things um so I think I can Kelly
 
01:39:32.109 --> 01:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
would you please remind me I promise to
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
do this thank you
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
um um but certainly I I'll send a draft
 
01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:41.719 align:start position:0%
before I send it out okay and so we can
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
add our right we can additional
 
01:39:45.629 --> 01:39:45.639 align:start position:0%
questions I it's you know the way you
 
01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
ask question on Research is incredibly
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
important so right it'll be very U
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
generic okay let this is good this is
 
01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
good all right so I think we we're going
 
01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:57.719 align:start position:0%
to do this first and then we'll then
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
we'll look at maybe inviting some in as
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
well yeah um was a good point Tim that
 
01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
to brought it out so okay great well
 
01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:08.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I have a question for
 
01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:17.550 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I have a question for
the

01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
director we got this sheet with all the
 
01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.470 align:start position:0%
director we got this sheet with all the
um

01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
charity revenues on
 
01:40:26.189 --> 01:40:26.199 align:start position:0%
it I was going to ask the question what
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
was the difference between a nonprofit
 
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
and a charity there's a lot of people on
 
01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.430 align:start position:0%
and a charity there's a lot of people on
the

01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:33.629 --> 01:40:33.639 align:start position:0%
sheet uh I know there's a couple of
 
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
Social Clubs a football club um and
 
01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
they're collecting money mostly on Bingo
 
01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
and Lucky Sevens but would these people
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
be eligible to apply for
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
um days at the casinos
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
yes it is and the the revenue is based
 
01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:57.679 align:start position:0%
if you look at the across the grid the
 
01:40:59.589 --> 01:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
ones that have HHR or the facilities
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
that have HHR so in some cases that
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
charity is not licensed at a facility
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
that has historic horse racing that's
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
why it's limited to Bing all lucky7 okay
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
and only I a followup I only asked
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
because you said not all nonprofits are
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
eligible correct so for example a
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
political action committee is
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
technically a not profit and it's not
 
01:41:25.629 --> 01:41:25.639 align:start position:0%
eligible okay but anybody on this sheet
 
01:41:27.870 --> 01:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
would be cor correct and it's it's
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
delineated in the RSA by the section of
 
01:41:31.199 --> 01:41:31.910 align:start position:0%
delineated in the RSA by the section of
the

01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
501c that it falls under okay 51 C3
 
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
being the most popular but there's a
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
number of all right thank
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
you hey Charlie again maybe to make it
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
easy for everybody you could kind of
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
break out the 50 C's on a single page
 
01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
and say here's an example of a 50c x
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
these are some of the Chri that fall
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
underneath it here and here's ones
 
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
here's the rest of them that don't
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed and here's the type of
 
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
things like the political action
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
committee right so maybe we have just a
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
one sheeter to understand which 5's are
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
eligible and which ones aren't eligible
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
be great can do that actually uh Val you
 
01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
you all right well that'll be helpful so
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll have that for well look at
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
that as well see why commission before
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
yeah right so
 
01:42:25.229 --> 01:42:25.239 align:start position:0%
okay so anyway
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
um and on the agenda I I said that we
 
01:42:31.950 --> 01:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
should start the the conversation on the
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
number and location of charal gaming but
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
I think we've already kind of discussed
 
01:42:38.669 --> 01:42:38.679 align:start position:0%
that and that'll be for another day that
 
01:42:40.709 --> 01:42:40.719 align:start position:0%
we'll have a more more in-depth
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
discussion about that as well um um as a
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
commission so let's talk about the next
 
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:52.790 align:start position:0%
commission so let's talk about the next
meeting

01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
um uh my sense is that not everybody
 
01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
wants Christmas is coming
 
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
up um and I know the the first week of
 
01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
January is a tough one for the
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
legislators in the room because that's
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
when you're both going to be in session
 
01:43:12.669 --> 01:43:12.679 align:start position:0%
dealing with all the retained
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
bills so I'm looking at maybe the second
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
the second week of
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
to so one one a session guys is that the
 
01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:44.669 align:start position:0%
to so one one a session guys is that the
uh

01:43:44.669 --> 01:43:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
33rd so that first week is going to be I
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
know in the Senate we're pushing all of
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
our hearings as fast as possible so I
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
think that second week again on Mondays
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
will be okay um because usually you know
 
01:43:57.550 --> 01:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of that committee
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
activity on Mondays okay Mr chairman did
 
01:44:03.229 --> 01:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
you say um in the last meeting that the
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
10th would be an option of
 
01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:08.030 align:start position:0%
10th would be an option of
December

01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
December
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh I got it in my book that we're going
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
to meet on the 10th at 10
 
01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:14.570 align:start position:0%
to meet on the 10th at 10
o'clock

01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:16.270 align:start position:0%
o'clock
[Music]

01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
um December 10th
 
01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
10 December 10th is a Sunday
 
01:44:36.589 --> 01:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
talking no December I mean if we were do
 
01:44:38.589 --> 01:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
another meeting this month you know
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
pipes it be it'll be like the 18th which
 
01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:42.229 align:start position:0%
pipes it be it'll be like the 18th which
would

01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
Christmas January right to
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
January I didn't think there' be much
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
objection to
 
01:44:57.119 --> 01:45:00.030 align:start position:0%
objection to
that

01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
so well here we go now now now we're
 
01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to be I mean the next six
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
months will be or five months anyway so
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking at January 8th Monday try
 
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
to do this on Mondays most of the work
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
is still in the middle of the week for
 
01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
um I know with Co we it used to be in
 
01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
the house side it was just Tuesday
 
01:45:24.430 --> 01:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays and
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
Thursdays but now it's spread because
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
they've doubled up the rooms so they
 
01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
have to schedule them uh all five days
 
01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:33.229 align:start position:0%
have to schedule them uh all five days
for

01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
hearings there won't be any session days
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
