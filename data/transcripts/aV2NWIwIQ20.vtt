00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
and then on the second page uh number
 
00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 align:start position:0%
two on line four
 
00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 align:start position:0%
it was recommended by Mr head that we
 
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 align:start position:0%
oh what why is that
 
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
uh that's what I was looking for
 
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.869 align:start position:0%
uh that's what I was looking for
um

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 align:start position:0%
okay that's the records
 
00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.770 align:start position:0%
okay that's the records
um

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know what I recall is that
 
00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
um some of the records like for example
 
00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
some of the records that schools may
 
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
have is not their records but
 
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.349 align:start position:0%
have is not their records but
um

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 align:start position:0%
you know medical records from a medical
 
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
facility so it's not actually their
 
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.609 align:start position:0%
facility so it's not actually their
records

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
so for them to give that up was in
 
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
question oh okay because this is
 
00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
could we possibly say that both parents
 
00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 align:start position:0%
uh a right to the same records whatever
 
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
right the parents have and just put your
 
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh speaker on yeah I don't know if we're
 
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
being televised or not
 
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.390 align:start position:0%
being televised or not
um

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's been an issue that in the past
 
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
that both parents aren't getting the
 
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
records only one of the parents gets the
 
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
record and the other one doesn't and I
 
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
didn't know if that was an attempt on
 
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
this bill to do that where it kind of
 
00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
matched up that way
 
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
uh with the rest of it
 
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh bill
 
00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
um otherwise yeah I'm not sure where
 
00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
it's going
 
00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.510 align:start position:0%
it's going
wow

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
wow
 
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
so I was wondering if we could a minute
 
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 align:start position:0%
okay to be cleared as far as what as far
 
00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 align:start position:0%
as that we're not trying to get records
 
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to have which I
 
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
really don't know what those would be
 
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
yeah but if one there if the records are
 
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
available to one parent the same record
 
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
would be available to the other parent
 
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
right there wasn't one time I know in
 
00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
the past that
 
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
the you know the custodial parent when
 
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
we used to do that would get the records
 
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
but then the non-cost oil would not they
 
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
would not be available to them and then
 
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
the school said well you need to send us
 
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
your address to say the other thing
 
00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
if you want them and we thought we
 
00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
settled it that way but I'm I'm hearing
 
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
it didn't get settled but I thought
 
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
maybe a simple something simple in here
 
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.670 align:start position:0%
maybe a simple something simple in here
um

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of the wording
 
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.150 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of the wording
um

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 align:start position:0%
any records available for one parent
 
00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 align:start position:0%
would be available to the other so so if
 
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's one parent that's
 
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know therapy for the child the other
 
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.850 align:start position:0%
you know therapy for the child the other
parent

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
would be able to get those records
 
00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
I would think so as long unless there's
 
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
oh you know what's the score if the
 
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
court said otherwise of course
 
00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
that would be appropriate so so again
 
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
the court would be deciding we might
 
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
whether would you mind asking the
 
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
be back there
 
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have a sponsor here okay
 
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
chart of what is accessible
 
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
um for parents would you like me to
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
print it out real quick yeah that'd be
 
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 align:start position:0%
representative yes uh representative
 
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question this is
 
00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
this bill is on uh based on shared
 
00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
parenting correct
 
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
yep so if you you're always going to
 
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
have one custodial parent so if this is
 
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be a custodial
 
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.749 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be a custodial
parent

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.189 align:start position:0%
parent
correct

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
could be shared right but if it but if
 
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's shared parenting both parents
 
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
should have access to the records
 
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.129 align:start position:0%
should have access to the records
correct

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
again that same uh
 
00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
the same situation that I gave you if if
 
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
if a parent's paying for
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
therapy for their child
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
um what you're saying is that
 
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
the other parents should be able to
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
access those records yes and the reason
 
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
why I'm saying that is
 
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.870 align:start position:0%
why I'm saying that is
um

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
like I I know of an instance where uh
 
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
the father is paying
 
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.070 align:start position:0%
the father is paying
or

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
the services for this child
 
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
um because the finances are a little bit
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
tighter on the mother's side because of
 
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
what she's carried on for her own
 
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.170 align:start position:0%
what she's carried on for her own
burdens

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
burdens
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
the father should have access to that as
 
00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
well too wouldn't you say even though
 
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
the child's living with the mother and
 
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
it's she had parenting time but the
 
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
father was trying to do the the right
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
thing by helping extra by paying for the
 
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
services he should have access for what
 
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
he's paying for right well you should
 
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
have access for what he's paying for
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
yeah but right but in my scenario these
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
you know that one party's not paying for
 
00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.870 align:start position:0%
you know that one party's not paying for
it

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
and it and it was on one of the parties
 
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
to seek that therapy so
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the other party should
 
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
have access to those records
 
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
uh and then you look at the best
 
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
interests of the child with those
 
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
records produce
 
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
something that would make the child uh
 
00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
you know anxious over uh you know saying
 
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
something you know to the therapist
 
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
about one parent or another uh would
 
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.430 align:start position:0%
about one parent or another uh would
that

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is is about represent
 
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and rights based on
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
shared parenting so if they're shared
 
00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 align:start position:0%
doing shared parenting I think
 
00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 align:start position:0%
everything needs to be shared
 
00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.309 align:start position:0%
everything needs to be shared
okay

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 align:start position:0%
because I have to think from the past
 
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 align:start position:0%
might be butting in on you I think I am
 
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I was just going to concur
 
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.430 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I was just going to concur
that

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
um unless there's an uh something in the
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
law that states that the parent should
 
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 align:start position:0%
not be able to access those records
 
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
whether it's 20 80 50 50 60 40 however
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's shared it is a shared parenting and
 
00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be cooperatively
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
working together as parents so I would
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
say it should be
 
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
um well the record should be shared I
 
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
mean we have cases where a person could
 
00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:25.259 align:start position:0%
be deployed and they don't have access
 
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
to the child because they're not even
 
00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
here but yet they do need to know what's
 
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
happening with the child with regard to
 
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
their medical situation so that they can
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
be a part of the decision-making process
 
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.950 align:start position:0%
be a part of the decision-making process
yeah

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah I just I just warn against
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
um ammunition you know if there's
 
00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
another parent looking for something for
 
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
ammunition you know I don't know how
 
00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:49.259 align:start position:0%
that's determined
 
00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:50.699 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there should be an
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
intent yeah I would like I would I would
 
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
like to get you know my child help I
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
understand you're paying for therapy I'd
 
00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
like I'd like I'd like to access those
 
00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
records because I would like to help and
 
00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
I don't want to duplicate it
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's all in that case yes that that
 
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
would be uh well you know as a parent
 
00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
you have a right to the record yeah it
 
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't come on put your speaker on
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
sorry about that as a parent you have
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
right to record regardless who pays for
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
them necessarily
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh what schools public schools public
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
pays for schools but the records are
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
accessible to the parent naturally right
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
um now we're going down the road of this
 
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
bill and the Shared Parenting share
 
00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
apparently we talk about I think mostly
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's about physical but we used to have
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
it divided up it was legal and it was
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
physical and this used to come under the
 
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:48.140 align:start position:0%
but again we don't do we don't do
 
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
custodial anymore we do each parent has
 
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of Rights and
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that's what just comes
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
out of the parenting plan and
 
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.670 align:start position:0%
out of the parenting plan and
uh

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019 align:start position:0%
so we did away with that we're very
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
futuristic here in New Hampshire
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
definitely ahead of the federal
 
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
government which usually which called
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
people either an absent parent or they
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
we or they call them a non-custodial
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
parent and that's where the issue is
 
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
risen in the past is people just want to
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
be involved with their children and know
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
so so shared parenting they would have
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
access to those records especially in
 
00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:28.019 align:start position:0%
school you know if the court didn't say
 
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
you can't have access when you go to the
 
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
school and they say well you know and
 
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
there's one parent that's dropping the
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
child off picking a child up and the
 
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
other parent shows up
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
um you know you just show your dockets
 
00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:41.459 align:start position:0%
and I'm you know your your uh final
 
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
order saying you have a good share
 
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
parenting I have that responsibility
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
and you have access to those records
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know yeah I don't know what you
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
have I I would think we would
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
typically in a shared parenting
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
situation with the schools the schools
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
know that there's a shared parenting
 
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
plan in place and documents are sent to
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
both parents all the time even all the
 
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
notices I know that when I was teaching
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
I would send out one to the mother one
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the father and
 
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
um they always double the communication
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
to make sure both parents are in the
 
00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.530 align:start position:0%
to make sure both parents are in the
loop

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
loop
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
okay so so that's not at issue then uh
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
with respect to school uh how about
 
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:35.090 align:start position:0%
with respect to school uh how about
medical

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
oh each side of the parenting plan
 
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
you're not gonna make her put a
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
microphone on like you made uh yeah I
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah actually uh that's a good idea
 
00:10:59.930 --> 00:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
actually if if uh somebody wants a weigh
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
in on this discussion uh clarify it for
 
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
in on this discussion uh clarify it for
us

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
uh Aaron Justina with New Hampshire
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
legal assistance um in terms of
 
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
information sharing and access to
 
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.370 align:start position:0%
information sharing and access to
records

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
um if you it's already that language is
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
already in uh the current parenting plan
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
form it's on page seven paragraph e
 
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
um and IT addresses unless there's a
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
court order stating otherwise both
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
parents so again regardless of
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
um what the percentage of time is both
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
parents have equal rights to inspect and
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
receive school records
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
um both parents are encouraged to
 
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
consult with school staff
 
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
um both parents have equal rights to
 
00:11:50.329 --> 00:11:50.339 align:start position:0%
inspect and receive governmental agency
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement records both parents
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
have equal rights to consult with any
 
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
person who provides care or treatment
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
for the children and to inspect and
 
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
receive Medical Dental or psychological
 
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
records subject to other statutory
 
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.870 align:start position:0%
records subject to other statutory
restrictions

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
so that that includes medical yes
 
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
medical records yes okay
 
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
and Consulting with providers as well
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
that both parents have access to that
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
under the current parenting plan
 
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
certainly uh parties if it's unsafe for
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
whatever reason in the uh situation you
 
00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
were discussing
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
um representative long if there was a
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
concern uh for example
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
um a child's been abused by a parent
 
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
that there's been a finding of that and
 
00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:37.019 align:start position:0%
a child in a therapeutic environment and
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
is talking about these issues there
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
could potentially I would think be some
 
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
restrictions on uh what the
 
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
the abused parent has access to just in
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
terms of whether or not that's in the
 
00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child to release
 
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
that information but General languages
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
that both parents have equal access to
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
review and have access to all of those
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
Medical Dental psychological school
 
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.790 align:start position:0%
Medical Dental psychological school
records

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
and that would be regardless to the
 
00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
percentage of correct oh parenting
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
rights responsibility correct correct if
 
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh parenting time as
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
well as decision making so residential
 
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
responsibility and decision making
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's joint or soul
 
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:29.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:32.579 align:start position:0%
so so I believe what the issues were
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
with 185
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.269 align:start position:0%
was the
um

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
the presumption of shared parenting
 
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.350 align:start position:0%
the presumption of shared parenting
language

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
and also the uh I believe was there
 
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence in here
 
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.470 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence in here
yeah

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
yeah there was and so so those were the
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
two issues
 
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
what was the third
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
the third issue when we looked at this
 
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
the last time and we were looking at
 
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
when it came in again
 
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
um they wanted a definition for fit
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
parent because the term fit parent is
 
00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
and we did I worked with representative
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
Moulton on a um
 
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
addressing those two issues there was
 
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
the fit parenting issue and then there
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
was another issue
 
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.030 align:start position:0%
was another issue
um

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:32.459 align:start position:0%
um yeah number three in section B
 
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
and we reworded that as well
 
00:14:35.579 --> 00:14:36.949 align:start position:0%
and we reworded that as well
um

00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
we were proposing a rewording of that
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
and then the question
 
00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:42.899 align:start position:0%
um that was coming before the committee
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
was the clear and convincing
 
00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
was the clear and convincing
evidence-based

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.069 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
um

00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:56.459 align:start position:0%
it was um if one of the parties does not
 
00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
request sole primary attorney
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the child yes and
 
00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:02.459 align:start position:0%
then the part that we were changing it
 
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
said one parent lives or Works outside
 
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
the town one lives outside the child
 
00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:10.139 align:start position:0%
School District or one parent is
 
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
convicted of abuse and we've changed it
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
to read one parent lives a substantial
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
distance outside the child school
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
district one parent is committed to
 
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.710 align:start position:0%
district one parent is committed to
frequent

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
frequent
 
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.670 align:start position:0%
frequent
um

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
significant periods of time away from
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
home due to military or employment
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
obligations or one parent is convicted
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
of abuse or neglect
 
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
and those are all agreed upon things
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
between the two parents it was just the
 
00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
wording that representative Moulton
 
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
wanted to do it a little bit more
 
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.129 align:start position:0%
wanted to do it a little bit more
defined

00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
and as far as the fit parenting we could
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
not find a definition in New Hampshire
 
00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:51.740 align:start position:0%
law that defined fit parent
 
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
so we looked at it was actually taken
 
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
from the dcyf motion for parent hearing
 
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
and we went by that and just basically
 
00:16:06.129 --> 00:16:06.139 align:start position:0%
saying fit parent means having a present
 
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
ability to care for a child having the
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
basic necessities of having a home or
 
00:16:13.129 --> 00:16:13.139 align:start position:0%
other shelter a means of supporting the
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
child whether through employment or
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
other income and pose no harm to the
 
00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:28.150 align:start position:0%
other income and pose no harm to the
child

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
the dcyf okay that came from yeah the
 
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
dcyf motion for a fit parent hearing is
 
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
where we came up where there was no
 
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
other definition in New Hampshire law so
 
00:16:41.449 --> 00:16:41.459 align:start position:0%
we're in a in the original bill is uh
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
the reference to fit that parenting
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that would have been just under the
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
definition and I'd have to go back
 
00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:50.579 align:start position:0%
through I know that came up I think it
 
00:16:50.579 --> 00:16:51.530 align:start position:0%
through I know that came up I think it
was

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:59.329 align:start position:0%
was
um

00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond is the one who um
 
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
on the on our committee who had a
 
00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
question about that definition and
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's why we representative Fulton and
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
I uh found a way found a definition for
 
00:17:10.919 --> 00:17:13.010 align:start position:0%
I uh found a way found a definition for
it

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly sure where exactly in
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
the bill that the term fit parent is
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay so it's in the Sydney Amendment it
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
was offered to us and I don't believe
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
the Amendments
 
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.789 align:start position:0%
the Amendments
um

00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we took the amendment up
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
and the full committee does anybody
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
remember because but it is in the it is
 
00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:42.539 align:start position:0%
in the other definition of joint
 
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
parenting it's it it referred to uh with
 
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
a child by both fit parents so then we
 
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%

foreign

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:39.950 align:start position:0%

is Court held unconstitutional a trial
 
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
Court's order requiring a fit parent to

permit visitations with her children
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
grandparents the court recognized that
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
the United States Constitution protects
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
the fundamental rights of parents to
 
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.270 align:start position:0%
the fundamental rights of parents to
make

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
decisions concerning the care custody
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
and control over their children to
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
protect that right a plurality introxel
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
applied a presumption that fit parents
 
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
act in the best interests of their
 
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
children so parents are presumed fit
 
00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:30.419 align:start position:0%
unless proven otherwise in a definition
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
of fit
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
no you're a presumed fit
 
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:38.690 align:start position:0%
no you're a presumed fit
yes

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
so uh okay so somebody who
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
is substantially out of the district or
 
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
somebody who works in another state uh
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
they're assume fit and that doesn't
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
there still remain fit even if they're
 
00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:00.830 align:start position:0%
there still remain fit even if they're
substantially

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
on a district or work in another state
 
00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:06.059 align:start position:0%
correct for Shared Parenting purpose yes
 
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
they definitely would so if I gotta get
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
up at 3 30 in the morning to uh be to
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
work for six
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
um and I have custody of my child I wake
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
up the child at three to take them
 
00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:19.460 align:start position:0%
wherever I gotta take them
 
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
or if I choose
 
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.110 align:start position:0%
or if I choose
um

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
maybe my parents their grandparents take
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
care of them that's all considered fit
 
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
in in that opinion yeah why wouldn't it
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
yeah okay yeah definitely the question
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
yep definitely
 
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
and parents have the right to
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
make arrangements for their children if
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
they live a distance away I mean you
 
00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:48.059 align:start position:0%
would hopefully work that out with your
 
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
other co-parent
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and when you can't you may have a
 
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
family member get your kid to daycare
 
00:20:57.529 --> 00:20:57.539 align:start position:0%
like like married parents do
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
I mean yeah well
 
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
the divorce couples right not always
 
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
line up like married couples not always
 
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.409 align:start position:0%
line up like married couples not always
so

00:21:09.409 --> 00:21:09.419 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
okay but the parents are still presumed
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
fit and less proven otherwise in a court
 
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:23.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh can I make a comment on the records
 
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.789 align:start position:0%
uh can I make a comment on the records
too

00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
Honda wreckage you were talking about
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
the school records and medical records
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
yeah parents do have the right to have
 
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
that but what's happening schools
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
medical they're not allowing one parent
 
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
to have that so I think it needs to be
 
00:21:44.049 --> 00:21:44.059 align:start position:0%
in Statue it is in the parenting plan
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
but if it's not in statute why would why
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
would the school follow that
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay I mean I think we have to have so
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
we need it clarified yeah right
 
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.390 align:start position:0%
we need it clarified yeah right
okay

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
so there's there's four actions we need
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
to recommend to the full committee one
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
is the presumption of shared parenting
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
um is there any discussion on that uh
 
00:22:19.919 --> 00:22:21.649 align:start position:0%
um is there any discussion on that uh
yes

00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
representative ball
 
00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:27.299 align:start position:0%
yes I think that we should
 
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
the presumption of shared parenting I
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
think that we should just stay with the
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
wording as it is in the amendment that
 
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.649 align:start position:0%
wording as it is in the amendment that
was

00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
um presented to us where joint parenting
 
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
schedule means approximately equal
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
and I think that we keep it there I
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't know I know we use the term shared
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
parenting throughout but we do want it
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
to not say presumption of 50 50 but just
 
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.830 align:start position:0%
to not say presumption of 50 50 but just
the

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
that it means approximately equal
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
residential parenting okay and that's in
 
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
that's a knee amended version that was
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
in the second that was in the last
 
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay so I got to figure out
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
it was amazing I don't recall that I I
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
thought we looked at the amendment
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
because I got my red pen all over it it
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
was thinking it was discussed 2023 and
 
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
then it was the um zero seven five eight
 
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
H is the amendment I'm looking at that
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
was the last one same same here uh so
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
that went before the full yes it did
 
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
okay so with respect to the Joint
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
parenting schedule you're talking about
 
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
line five
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
yes it should remain that way as saying
 
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
no I don't have lines I just have the
 
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.730 align:start position:0%
no I don't have lines I just have the
definition

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:36.740 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
6-a correct yeah
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
um where it says joint parenting means
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
approximately equal residential
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
parenting I think it should remain that
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
equal residential parenting
 
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
responsibilities include overnights with
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
okay so recommend uh so we'll recommend
 
00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.149 align:start position:0%
okay so recommend uh so we'll recommend
that

00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
6 Dash a
 
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:10.370 align:start position:0%
6 Dash a
remains

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear potential I think it's
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
going to come up
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
why why it means to be that
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
what we want is the presumption correct
 
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.909 align:start position:0%
what we want is the presumption correct
yeah

00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
okay okay so you want the word
 
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
presumption in there so joint priority
 
00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:38.900 align:start position:0%
schedule means
 
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
approximately equal or the presumption
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
of equal okay so do we want to do we
 
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
need to wear presumption in there I
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe so
 
00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
huh I don't think we need the word a pro
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need the word
 
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
presumption because it right there tells
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
we're taking out I know that we had
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
discussed a lot when we were talking
 
00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:06.419 align:start position:0%
before this went in for an amendment we
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
were talking a lot about a presumption
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
of and they were calling it 50 50 or
 
00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:12.539 align:start position:0%
presumption of equal parenting but this
 
00:25:15.169 --> 00:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
is actually in my opinion
 
00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:16.010 align:start position:0%
is actually in my opinion
um

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:18.500 align:start position:0%
meaning approximately equal
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
it's it means the same thing but we're
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
not trying to cut the baby right in half
 
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
there may
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
it might it might be 51 to 49 just the
 
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:30.539 align:start position:0%
way because every month could be a
 
00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:31.490 align:start position:0%
way because every month could be a
different

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
day so that's what the big discussion
 
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
was how do we how do we get 50 50. it's
 
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
impossible to make sure then you'll have
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
somebody yeah I'm opposed to 50 50
 
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
Assumption of 50 50. right um but but I
 
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
need definition for the I mean it seems
 
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
to me that
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh the presumption word
 
00:25:54.769 --> 00:25:54.779 align:start position:0%
makes me a little more comfortable
 
00:25:54.779 --> 00:25:56.090 align:start position:0%
makes me a little more comfortable
um

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
I I so you're saying instead of
 
00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:00.419 align:start position:0%
approximately just means presumption of
 
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
equal residential
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
to say uh joint parenting schedule means
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
a presumption of equal
 
00:26:08.039 --> 00:26:09.169 align:start position:0%
a presumption of equal
this

00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
a recall parenting
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:15.539 align:start position:0%
we've always intended and tried to do
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
this in the past
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
because we wanted a legal thing
 
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
something legal that would say you've
 
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
got a presumption that you get your
 
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
parental rights will give you 50 of the
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
time however that didn't mean that we
 
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
expected everyone to utilize it or even
 
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
be able to utilize it but it gave them a
 
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
uh an ability to appeal
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
right now there's not much of an ability
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
to appeal because you're you're stuck
 
00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:42.010 align:start position:0%
to appeal because you're you're stuck
with

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:42.020 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.549 align:start position:0%
with
presumption

00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
presumption
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
and such so
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
that's really what we always
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
where we wanted to go with this
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
this is actually physical it's it's more
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
a right
 
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
to try to utilize
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
legal right to utilize yeah I know this
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
presumption are out the window if
 
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
there's if there's an issue with uh you
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
know an abuse and neglect uh domestic
 
00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:15.710 align:start position:0%
know an abuse and neglect uh domestic
violence

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
violence
 
00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
um so those those presumptions would be
 
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
out so I don't know what protects that
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know what protects
 
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
or dimension of violence
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
um or a mental health issue with a
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
parent or a substance use issue with a
 
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.190 align:start position:0%
parent or a substance use issue with a
parent

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
under the current joint parenting
 
00:27:39.169 --> 00:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
approximately equal to a presumption
 
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
that's why I thought the presumption
 
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
word being in there would
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
help that and it would I have to agree
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that we just put in
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
joint parenting schedule means a
 
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
presumption of approximately equal
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
parenting and just put in a presumption
 
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
of actually I I don't know what language
 
00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:00.020 align:start position:0%
protects what I'm looking to protect
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
could you advise as to
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
you might have to get up there though
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
because I I don't know if they're
 
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
legal assistance
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
um we would be opposed to any language
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
regarding presumption of shared
 
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
presumption of equal or approximately
 
00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.250 align:start position:0%
presumption of equal or approximately
equal

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:24.260 align:start position:0%
equal
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
we believe that the current language of
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
frequent and continuing contact already
 
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
that that's the starting point and that
 
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
there are then factors to consider
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
including whether domestic violence is
 
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.950 align:start position:0%
including whether domestic violence is
present

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
we feel strongly that any mention of
 
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
presumption of equal or approximately
 
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
equal or shared or 50 50 will in fact
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
prevent victims from coming forward
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
to leave a relationship because they
 
00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
will feel that it is better for them if
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
if they know that the court is
 
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
automatically going to apply a 50 50
 
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
standard of parenting time then they
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
will consider that it is safer in fact
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
for them to remain in the home
 
00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:15.539 align:start position:0%
to have eyes on the children to make
 
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
sure that the children are protected if
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
they know that otherwise if they go to
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
court that 50 percent of the time then
 
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:24.539 align:start position:0%
they will not have eyes on the children
 
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
they will not be able to protect their
 
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
children 50 percent of the time that
 
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:30.779 align:start position:0%
will be a huge barrier for victims to
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
leave a domestic violence relationship
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
so we're in strong opposition of
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
um moving beyond the current language
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
and statute which is promoting
 
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
continuing and frequent contact okay now
 
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
does the language fit parent change any
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
of that I mean somebody who's domestic
 
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
violence or abusive neglect on a child I
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
mean they wouldn't be considered a fit
 
00:29:57.889 --> 00:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
parent so they wouldn't be
 
00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
assumed or
 
00:30:00.659 --> 00:30:01.490 align:start position:0%
assumed or
um

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be
 
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be a presumption that
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
they'd get the equal time because then
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
I I haven't really thought about
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
defining the term fit parent I think
 
00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
that that creates another set of
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
obstacles for a judge certainly to
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
consider then you're going to have
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
what does that look like exactly what
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
evidence is going to be required to
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
present in order to demonstrate whether
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
you are or are not a fit parent
 
00:30:35.399 --> 00:30:36.289 align:start position:0%
you are or are not a fit parent
um

00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:36.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
I think the language that we currently
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
have in statute works it needs to be
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
applied consistently
 
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
um but I don't know if adding a
 
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
it's possible that adding a definition
 
00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:51.799 align:start position:0%
of fit parent could create
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
additional issues
 
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it would correct the
 
00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:56.769 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it would correct the
problem

00:30:56.769 --> 00:30:56.779 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:30:59.510 --> 00:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay because a fit Baron could also
 
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
frequent or continuing contact that that
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
that could go to the current language
 
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
right um
 
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.830 align:start position:0%
right um
okay

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:12.769 --> 00:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
okay I I can't say as I agree with all
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
that first of all it um
 
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
it'll present now we're working with a
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
presumption that people with batteries
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
and if somebody's going to stay back
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for at least I'm
 
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
looking for is right now you're going to
 
00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
court and you have zero you have nothing
 
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
then they have to build it up I'd like
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
to see it started 50 50. and then chip
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
it back and re relayer it and that's
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
what this we've been working on this 25
 
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.350 align:start position:0%
what this we've been working on this 25
years

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:42.299 align:start position:0%
yeah we've made really good progress but
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
we haven't quite got to that
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
right this gives you
 
00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
rights and
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
in in that under that same uh statement
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
you know I'm looking for where because
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
when we change something I like to look
 
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:04.909 align:start position:0%
when we change something I like to look
at

00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
what's the potential of some of these
 
00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
becoming conflicts you know adding
 
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
conflict to the current conflict uh
 
00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
you know cases we have now
 
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.350 align:start position:0%
you know cases we have now
um

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
you know but but there's a clear
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
listening to testimony for all these
 
00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:24.059 align:start position:0%
years there's a clear
 
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
uh frequent and or continuing contact
 
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
that's just not happening
 
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
you know so what is it that we have to
 
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.230 align:start position:0%
you know so what is it that we have to
do

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.090 align:start position:0%
uh to
um

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
you know to make that happen
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh I think adding a fit parent
 
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
um you know not putting in the
 
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
definition is already a couple
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
definitions already heard that's good
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
enough for me
 
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.789 align:start position:0%
enough for me
um

00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
fit parents assume that there's no
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
domestic vial there's there's the
 
00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:57.059 align:start position:0%
violence there's no
 
00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
um abuse and neglect on a child there's
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
no substance or mental health
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.130 align:start position:0%
um I
so

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
yeah frequent or continuing contact
 
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
uh to me
 
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.870 align:start position:0%
uh to me
seems

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
seems
 
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.130 align:start position:0%
seems
um

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
seems what the problem is
 
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
it does I hate to say that but it but it
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
does it does seem to uh you know because
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
we're hearing testimony of people that
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
just aren't getting the frequent or
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
continued contact and their fit parent
 
00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:36.299 align:start position:0%
you know uh as far as I could know you
 
00:33:36.299 --> 00:33:37.549 align:start position:0%
you know uh as far as I could know you
know

00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
um not that they just tell me but you
 
00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:42.059 align:start position:0%
know it seems consistent with their
 
00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
testimony year after year so
 
00:33:45.179 --> 00:33:49.130 align:start position:0%
testimony year after year so
uh

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
what do you think I agree with you
 
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
um that that frequent and continued
 
00:33:57.529 --> 00:33:57.539 align:start position:0%
visits has been
 
00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:00.059 align:start position:0%
a problem in the court for years I think
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
there is no definition of what is
 
00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:03.059 align:start position:0%
frequent and what is frequent to one
 
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
person seeing their child every other
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
week is not frequent it's not enough to
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
maintain a relationship and I think the
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
whole point is to do what's in the best
 
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
ensure that the child and all evidence
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
points to having the child maintain a
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
relationship with both parents equally
 
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
is what is Works what works and of
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
course we're not talking about cases
 
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
where Devi and we have other things but
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
in a case where we have nothing we're
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with a fit parent two parents
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
who have always had access to their
 
00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
children have been good parents that we
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that for in the
 
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
child's best interest that the
 
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
relationship with both parent continues
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
actually could I have you sit over there
 
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
and just put the mic on I don't know
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
who's recording or if it's even being
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh so if you consider those cases where
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
prior to the separation prior to the
 
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.050 align:start position:0%
prior to the separation prior to the
divorce

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
divorce
 
00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.310 align:start position:0%
divorce
the

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's possible that somebody was
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
traveling for work or was on the road a
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
lot or
 
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.950 align:start position:0%
lot or
um

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
may have been deployed uh so those
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
situations where they were not in the
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
home all of the time it wasn't 50 50. it
 
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
was it was more like a 75-25 split right
 
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
even when they were in the home
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
so that should that change once the
 
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
marriage ends once the relationship ends
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
and you're looking at two different
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
households what if what they were used
 
00:36:07.609 --> 00:36:07.619 align:start position:0%
to Prior when the relationship was still
 
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:11.099 align:start position:0%
intact was a 75-25 split that's what the
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
kids are used to that's what everyone
 
00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
felt good about so now they're going to
 
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
go into court and the presumption is
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
going to be 50 50 right which is not
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
what they were practicing
 
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
prior to and I suppose they could come
 
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
to an agreement and that would address
 
00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:28.700 align:start position:0%
it but I think we're looking at
 
00:36:31.849 --> 00:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
situations where an assumption that
 
00:36:31.859 --> 00:36:33.650 align:start position:0%
situations where an assumption that
everybody

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
wants 50 50. everybody had 50 50 when
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
prior to the relationship ending and
 
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
so when we use frequent and continuing
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
contact IT addresses
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
those other types of situations it
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it a standard it doesn't
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
make it an assumption that that's what a
 
00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
family should look like that's what a
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
parenting a fit parent should have 50
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
percent you know somebody could be a fit
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
parent and still have 25 percent of the
 
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
time with the kiddo yeah no yeah we're
 
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
not talking 50 50.
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
I know the presumption of shared
 
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
presumption of shared parenting I I I'm
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
not looking at all at 50 50 because
 
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right you know I I
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
could have a 60 40.
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
um so I would I would want that I mean
 
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
it's when I go from 60 40 and
 
00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:29.339 align:start position:0%
divorce is filed and I go to zero until
 
00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
things get straightened out uh you know
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
that that's the issue that we're looking
 
00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:36.740 align:start position:0%
at so it's not a presumption of 50 50.
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's a presumption of
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
um you know I've shared parenting which
 
00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:44.339 align:start position:0%
hysterically right which which
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
historically has for me has been 60 40.
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
I've been 40 percent
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't yeah so so if we if we
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't assume the 50 50. I think it will
 
00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:02.510 align:start position:0%
don't assume the 50 50. I think it will
be

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
will the equal or Price that's a
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
starting point right it's a starting
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
point that it will be equal parenting
 
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
and yes you are correct that there could
 
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
be a parent that's deployed or has that
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
but let's look at it this way you could
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
have a person that goes into the
 
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
military service at 18 and they're they
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
are um retiring at 38 after 20 years
 
00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:23.339 align:start position:0%
their parent their children can be very
 
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
young at that point and even though they
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
may not have been they may have been
 
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:29.099 align:start position:0%
deployed but why would we be punishing
 
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
them now that they're no longer deployed
 
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
and that they can have a job and be
 
00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:35.099 align:start position:0%
close to home and put in time with their
 
00:38:35.099 --> 00:38:36.290 align:start position:0%
close to home and put in time with their
children

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
um and just because they're not at the
 
00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:40.619 align:start position:0%
home does not mean they are not involved
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
in that child life does not mean they're
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
not FaceTiming that child all the time
 
00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:47.220 align:start position:0%
so even though a parent may be having
 
00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:50.099 align:start position:0%
employment elsewhere that doesn't lessen
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that they are still the 50 50
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
parent whether they're there physically
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
or not emotionally they are so I think I
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
agree with representative uh bigford and
 
00:39:02.089 --> 00:39:02.099 align:start position:0%
we just are looking for a starting point
 
00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:05.099 align:start position:0%
and if need be we we adjust that and
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's also already built in the into it
 
00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
and that's why we were rewording that if
 
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
the parents agree that because of
 
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
employment far away or because of moves
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
that it may not be 50 50. but that
 
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that when we come to
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
reevaluate in three years that we don't
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
look at the parenting plan and say well
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
I've moved back into the area or I've I
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
have retired or I've gotten a new job
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
and now I can be home with my children
 
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
that they should lose that opportunity
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
so I think it's just coming back to that
 
00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
idea that what's in the best interest of
 
00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:38.099 align:start position:0%
the children is as much contact as they
 
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
can have with each parent
 
00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
I think that was the whole intent of
 
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
this bill like to add to that that when
 
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
we worked on a pairing plants and such
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
that it took years to get to that but we
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
said that the scenario of you know
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
somebody doing 60 40 whatever it was
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
during their marriage or whatever it was
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
that they were together when it comes to
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
go to court it's now time for reset now
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
we get to rearrange Our Lives to what's
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
going to work for our children and
 
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
families and often that means the change
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
of sometimes employment
 
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
sometimes a residence and that sort of
 
00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:13.619 align:start position:0%
thing so yeah we want to give them that
 
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
opportunity and it wasn't happening
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
before that because that's what would
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
happen the the justices or the marital
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
masses at the time who just say well
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
this is the way it's been so that's the
 
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
way you wanted it don't Focus continue
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
and we just need to give people the
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity and that and I think the
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
courts has made some progress right but
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
I also agree with the point that I'm not
 
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
sure as frequent as a defined enough
 
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.050 align:start position:0%
sure as frequent as a defined enough
word

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
to go with yeah so so I mean back to the
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child I you know if
 
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
I'm if I'm 60 40 and I'm the 40 and I'm
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
going through a divorce and I'm gonna
 
00:40:52.609 --> 00:40:52.619 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking for 50 50. uh I'm gonna
 
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
sell a 50 50. I'm gonna I'm that child's
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
gonna go to my mother's gonna go to my
 
00:40:59.810 --> 00:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
sisters or brothers and that's
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
disruptive to the child that is not what
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
the child is used to so if we assume the
 
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
50 50 it does change the child's
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
um what the child is accustomed to in
 
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
the case that it's not 50 50 it
 
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
absolutely does I I believe it
 
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
absolutely does a child changes their
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
class in school every single year
 
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
children are the most resilient and
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
adaptable little human beings and so I
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
do disagree with you and also going back
 
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
to the domestic violence
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
um or that type of a situation we also
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
have situations where traditionally and
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
I I'm just going to say traditionally
 
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
fathers did not get as much visitation
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
because they worked outside the home and
 
00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:44.099 align:start position:0%
so they got pushed into this 40 60 40
 
00:41:47.329 --> 00:41:47.339 align:start position:0%
situation and quite frankly there are
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
many men out there and dads who have
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
stayed in very abusive households
 
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to lose access
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
to their children and so they keep
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
putting up with the abuse that they're
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
taking within their home so abuse goes
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
both ways and I think I still go back
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
and I say it is up to the parent it's
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
not just you know you're saying well
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's the way it's always been 60 40 or
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not home but when you're getting a
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
divorce and nothing is going to be the
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
way it's been you're probably going to
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
be selling your house the children are
 
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
going to get new homes everything's
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
going to change and I think that we have
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
to have the reset and say well if
 
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
everything's going to change
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
half that child is came from the mother
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
and half that child came from the father
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
and both parents are equally have rights
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
to that child to raise that child and be
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
a part of that child so I absolutely
 
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
agree that we must stay
 
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:43.140 align:start position:0%
that we have equal as close as possible
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
we start at equal parenting and unless
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's proved otherwise that is the way it
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
should go or unless the parents agree
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and I totally disagree with that so
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
I'll agree to disagree with that it's
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
not what the child is accustomed to to
 
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
your argument if there were 50 50 the
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
child's accustomed to that but now that
 
00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:02.579 align:start position:0%
it's 60 40
 
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
the child's resilient and he could
 
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
adjust to that yeah I don't agree
 
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
um so okay so we're gonna we disagree
 
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh sure
 
00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.650 align:start position:0%
uh uh sure
so

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
um I had a husband who traveled all over
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
yeah could you introduce yourself oh
 
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
Lisa post I'm a representative from
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
lineborough New Boston and Mount Vernon
 
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my statement
 
00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.630 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my statement
here

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.530 align:start position:0%
here
um first

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
um first
 
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
I my husband traveled a lot and I took
 
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
care of the kids and lots of times
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
um when I was working I had to use a
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
babysitter for my kids they get used to
 
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
that my parents used to come down if my
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
husband was gone for an extended period
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
of time and they would take care of our
 
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
children sometimes his parents would
 
00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
come and help us out so all those people
 
00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:00.140 align:start position:0%
in their lives creates
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
a contact with each other that they get
 
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
used to and moving around doesn't change
 
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
that if we send them down to their
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
grandparents for a week in Texas
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
they come back happy they love it and
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
they they develop a relationship that
 
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
lasts a lifetime and so the same thing
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
happens if you get divorced you're
 
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
together and you get divorced and things
 
00:44:28.609 --> 00:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
change those children have made contact
 
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
with both parents and stay in contact
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
with both parents they have them for the
 
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives and while I realize
 
00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
people fight it's it's in the statistics
 
00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
here that approximately equal or 50 50
 
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
or however you want to put it that's
 
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
just a Wordsmith thing but for people
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
who can
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know have the ability to
 
00:44:56.809 --> 00:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
um have something in law where that can
 
00:44:59.450 --> 00:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
say they can have equal or approximately
 
00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:02.339 align:start position:0%
equal or 50 50 that gives them the
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to try this and see if they
 
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
can make it work because they can always
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
go back to the courts but this way this
 
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:14.099 align:start position:0%
gives the family a chance to thrive for
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
everyone moms dads grandparents because
 
00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
you know that if one if they're fighting
 
00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
one won't let their child go to that
 
00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
grandparent right it becomes this huge
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
thing and then become disconnected from
 
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
family members cousins things like that
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
so to keep a family together means a lot
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
and there is so many statistics and I
 
00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
know you guys got
 
00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:40.510 align:start position:0%
know you guys got
um

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
information from the National Parents
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
organization which gives you
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
the information that shows that it
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
children fare better parents feel
 
00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:56.339 align:start position:0%
um are better because they're not
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
stressed out they don't have the same
 
00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
kind of problems because if you have a
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
okay kind of a wiggle room I I have to
 
00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:06.380 align:start position:0%
work late can you keep the kids tonight
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
all those things would happen gradually
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
but it usually and and in all of the
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
literature it shows that it's better for
 
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
all of the family including grandparents
 
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
and cousins and things like that we all
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
want you know our families and our
 
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
children to be the healthiest they can
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
be and I think whatever wording you
 
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
choose equally or approximately equal
 
00:46:35.809 --> 00:46:35.819 align:start position:0%
which I think the presumption of equal
 
00:46:38.569 --> 00:46:38.579 align:start position:0%
or approximately equal gives that wiggle
 
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
room but also gives a standard
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
right so I I mean the only thing is I'm
 
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
not willing to I'm not looking to try
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
anything because yes you can also always
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
go back to court with the child and that
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
the child can't doesn't have that option
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh and my primary interest is with the
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
child uh you know it would be great and
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
by the way ninety percent of the cases
 
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
work out that way it's the 10 that we're
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
looking to
 
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
to try to get some sensibility to right
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
but it is the 10 that we're talking
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
about in these statistics right so so
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
when you say you want you you care for
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
the child yes you do care for the child
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
but it's up to the parents to care for
 
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
the child so yeah and I have no control
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
over that
 
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
they have the soul control over that
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
how are you saying has that I don't have
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
no control over how the parents treat
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
each other or the child that's not in
 
00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
our my control right but that's not our
 
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
job as the government we just give them
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
correct so that's out of my control so I
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
don't consider that what I consider is
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
the best interest of a child so we're in
 
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
these difficult cases
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
where is the child being harmed and
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
and I I don't believe that the
 
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
resilience is as big as sometimes we
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
think it may be uh that a child will
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
adjust quickly
 
00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and it all depends where the parents
 
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
are coming from
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
um as to why they want this 50 50 or all
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
of a sudden if you if you look at all
 
00:48:13.089 --> 00:48:13.099 align:start position:0%
the states that enacted this
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
everything went down domestic violence
 
00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
reports and all of that all went down so
 
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
I think you have to consider that it
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
it's already been enacted in many states
 
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
some that doesn't even have legislation
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
but they enacted it and they are
 
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
thriving so I don't know why we wouldn't
 
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
want that to happen over uh
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
language that is really similarly
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
you know so yeah I mean we beat up this
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
language I I'm in opposition to the to
 
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:50.339 align:start position:0%
this everybody else is in favor of it
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
that's fine we'll have the debate at the
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
full committee level I do want to add
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't be afraid of changing
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances I have uh grandchildren
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
that move every three to four years I
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
don't like that idea I hate it
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
but you know their dad's in the Coast
 
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
Guard and if you're in the military and
 
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
that's just Korea and they get they're
 
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
required to change with the federal
 
00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
government do why can't
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
people do a reset themselves and and
 
00:49:18.849 --> 00:49:18.859 align:start position:0%
realign their situation they have to
 
00:49:22.609 --> 00:49:22.619 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's a serious problem for
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh okay parents so so as as far has the
 
00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
presumption of shared parenting or the
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
50 50 we've discussed that where we
 
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
could just add one one last thing to
 
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
that and I think the purpose of writing
 
00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:38.099 align:start position:0%
this was really to bring our courts
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
together and what we learned when we
 
00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:41.780 align:start position:0%
visited the courthouse which was a
 
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
enlightening to me because I thought
 
00:49:47.089 --> 00:49:47.099 align:start position:0%
judges all thought the presumption was
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
50 50. that that's how they approached
 
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
every case but come to find out the
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
particular judge that we met said no I
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
don't presume 50 50. he goes the
 
00:49:58.250 --> 00:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
opposite way so what I think is we're
 
00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
trying to get all the courts in New
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to act equally because right
 
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
now what's happening to families is it's
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
a roll of the dice it depends upon which
 
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
judge you get and that's not fair to the
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
family it's not fair to anyone but it is
 
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
what is happening and I would not have
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
believed it if I did not hear it
 
00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
directly from the judge who said oh no I
 
00:50:19.609 --> 00:50:19.619 align:start position:0%
don't start that way even though we all
 
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
thought they did it's it really is not
 
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
the case so how does start
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
he doesn't he just does what he feels is
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
right is what he said so there is
 
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
nothing that a person can go back and
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
appeal it or say how this is why we
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
ended up coming up with well what about
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
all the Rules of Evidence how do we if I
 
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
didn't get awarded 50 50 how do I fight
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
that there's no way to even fight it but
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
the bigger situation here and why this
 
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
came forward is because
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the way the language is now the
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
judges are all on different pages when
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
they approach a new case and this is why
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get fairness throughout
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
the courts of New Hampshire and it is it
 
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
is not there and I will outright admit I
 
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
never expected to hear that it was not
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
there already I think we all thought it
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
was and it is not we were told that
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
right is not happening right but yeah
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'm clear on that I actually this
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
discussion is done we already made our
 
00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.430 align:start position:0%
discussion is done we already made our
decisions

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm in opposition to it uh you guys
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
are in favor of it we'll bring that
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
we'll bring it out to the full committee
 
00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:26.339 align:start position:0%
and have and further have this
 
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh no I don't have uh I got four minutes
 
00:51:36.049 --> 00:51:36.059 align:start position:0%
left to go through three more uh issues
 
00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:38.930 align:start position:0%
left to go through three more uh issues
uh

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence are we in
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
agreement that that ought not be in
 
00:51:42.839 --> 00:51:43.790 align:start position:0%
agreement that that ought not be in
there

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:51:47.089 --> 00:51:47.099 align:start position:0%
so everybody's okay with that yeah
 
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
okay that's what really helps you want
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
to appeal
 
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
and then uh the fit parent we already
 
00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
agreed on
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh the the current definitions there's a
 
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
couple of definitions that we heard and
 
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
we're good with that
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
with with the fit parent or did you want
 
00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:21.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
right basically that's what we're seeing
 
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
right correct yeah
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:33.059 align:start position:0%
I believe that was it right it was that
 
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
other minor change on defining
 
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
significant distances and that was in
 
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
agreement with parents but just to say
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
it needs to be significant
 
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
um distance away
 
00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:44.579 align:start position:0%
okay and that's that's in the uh I think
 
00:52:47.089 --> 00:52:47.099 align:start position:0%
that was in the amendment right yes well
 
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
no that was the um that was in the
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
original the amendment to the amendment
 
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
when it came forward oh we reworded it
 
00:52:56.329 --> 00:52:56.339 align:start position:0%
um to address the concerns that were
 
00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
brought forward by some of the committee
 
00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.450 align:start position:0%
brought forward by some of the committee
members

00:52:59.450 --> 00:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
because I got another that was
 
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
representative post Amendment zero five
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
five one h
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
is that the one you're referencing
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
zero seven five eight H and then it was
 
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton and I
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
um we're going to put forward another
 
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.370 align:start position:0%
um we're going to put forward another
amendment

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
to address
 
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.089 align:start position:0%
to address
um

00:53:29.089 --> 00:53:29.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
B number three
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
section B number three two B and then
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
number three
 
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:38.450 align:start position:0%
number three
yeah

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:53:42.049 --> 00:53:42.059 align:start position:0%
secondary hang on a minute on on the on
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment or on the original bill
 
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.290 align:start position:0%
the amendment or on the original bill
we

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
we were making an amendment on the
 
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
amendment Amendment on the amendment
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
okay B
 
00:53:54.049 --> 00:53:54.059 align:start position:0%
B3 I don't think yeah I do she wasn't
 
00:53:54.059 --> 00:53:57.049 align:start position:0%
B3 I don't think yeah I do she wasn't
significant

00:53:57.049 --> 00:53:57.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:58.730 --> 00:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
it was the wording where it said if the
 
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
parent works out of town if you look at
 
00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
number three uh section
 
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
B number three and the wording was just
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
saying if the parent lived out of town
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
and represent representative Moulton
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and I
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
we're working to address that concern
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be a significant
 
00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
difference for instance if a person
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
Works in Boston that's really not
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
we would consider that out of town but
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's not significant and shouldn't
 
00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
interfere with um parenting time
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right so so you and rep Mullen
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
will be bringing an amendment addressing
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
B3 yes
 
00:54:37.319 --> 00:54:52.970 align:start position:0%
B3 yes
okay

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:56.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:56.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:03.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
no that's the one you got it's on the
 
00:55:10.569 --> 00:55:10.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:26.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.530 align:start position:0%
 
connection

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
actually does somebody want to consider
 
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
bringing this into the full committee it
 
00:55:44.569 --> 00:55:44.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
so we're going to change that three is
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
that it for something else we're gonna
 
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
we're gonna they're bringing an
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
amendment to address this three right
 
00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:57.710 align:start position:0%
amendment to address this three right
here

00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
travel you know somebody working out of
 
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
state representative long chairman so
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
would this be something that we would
 
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
consider with the whole committee when
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
we bring forward the other Amendment so
 
00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:11.339 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess we would do that just take
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
I I don't like the outside the school
 
00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
district you taking that out
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
well we'll discuss that at the full
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
committee they're bringing they're
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
bringing an amendment in that will yeah
 
00:56:27.049 --> 00:56:27.059 align:start position:0%
we don't have the amendment now but is
 
00:56:28.609 --> 00:56:28.619 align:start position:0%
that the intent of the amendment because
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just getting caught up on it
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know what you're talking what
 
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
you're referring to I'm sorry I'm
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
looking at I'm just getting caught up
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
with that number three and it talks
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
about the school district to be a
 
00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:42.230 align:start position:0%
about the school district to be a
disqualifier

00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
disqualifier
 
00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:44.540 align:start position:0%
oh I didn't see
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
oh outside of the school district
 
00:56:49.849 --> 00:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
regions may include yeah so that would
 
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
not be a disqualifier it would be up to
 
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
I just
 
00:56:59.450 --> 00:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
so do you guys want more time on this
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
today primary because we we have a two
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:09.500 align:start position:0%
what on What
 
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
306 but at two o'clock I'm supposed to
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
okay so we pretty much know does
 
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
everybody feel confident we know what's
 
00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
going to the full committee yeah
 
00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:24.490 align:start position:0%
going to the full committee yeah
yeah okay

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:24.500 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:57:27.049 --> 00:57:27.059 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford the changing to
 
00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
that wording was
 
00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:29.510 align:start position:0%
that wording was
um

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
one parent lives a significant distance
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
outside of the child school so it's not
 
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
just one town over okay it would have to
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
be philosophical that's fine yeah and
 
00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
that's between these are just things
 
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
that parents kind of agree upon upon as
 
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
why they would have left well I don't
 
00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
want to give the wrong hint of somebody
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
like what about the school district
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
thing well that's what I'm saying so if
 
00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:54.059 align:start position:0%
that's also if it's within reason that's
 
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
the part I'm talking about it would have
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
to be a reason would be a significant
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
difference it can't be well one lives in
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
in Windham and one lives in Salem OR one
 
00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
lives in Atkinson that's close enough to
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
get children to school as opposed to one
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
lives in Salem and one lives up in North
 
00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.890 align:start position:0%
lives in Salem and one lives up in North
Conway

00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
Conway
 
00:58:11.809 --> 00:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
right that might be a significant
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
difference and a reason to say we
 
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
we might need to make a change on school
 
00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.290 align:start position:0%
we might need to make a change on school
nights

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
nights
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
do we even need to suggest it so that'll
 
00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
this will be a discussion we have enough
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
because we don't have that in front of
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
us I think it's already in there I know
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
other than the language that we have in
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
here you're right
 
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh the way they arrange their time that
 
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
they were able to not be in the
 
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
but wait that takes them every weekend I
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
think what they're they're putting it in
 
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
here so it can't be used against the
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
parent and but this is agreement between
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
the parents as to why
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
um it might not be 50 50 because of
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
these reasons
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm dragging my feet on it but
 
00:58:59.930 --> 00:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
but this they would be an agreement with
 
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
the past it would have to be it would be
 
00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
yeah so the parents will agree
 
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
they have to agree that the other ones
 
00:59:08.569 --> 00:59:08.579 align:start position:0%
and the other one would agree that it's
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
a significant distance okay so you know
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
for the child
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
businessman grew oh or reasonings not to
 
00:59:21.119 --> 00:59:23.210 align:start position:0%
businessman grew oh or reasonings not to
yeah

00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
yeah don't need that okay
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe you know reasons may include
 
00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:33.140 align:start position:0%
yeah excited about it
 
00:59:38.329 --> 00:59:38.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you everybody the uh
 
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:44.579 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on 185 is
 
00:59:44.579 --> 00:59:48.770 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on 185 is
adjourned

00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
your your memo will still have
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
I think we had just said the
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's a starting point
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.609 --> 01:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
right because everybody is so
 
01:00:43.619 --> 01:00:46.870 align:start position:0%
right because everybody is so
understands

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:49.849 --> 01:00:49.859 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right it was going to be a
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
legal presumption it needs to be oh 50
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
50. it's not approximately 50 50. that's
 
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
not going to cost us
 
01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:00.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
it's a mismatch okay well then take out
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
the word presumption because it's never
 
01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:12.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
once we get it through she's got a good
 
01:01:15.420 --> 01:12:02.930 align:start position:0%
once we get it through she's got a good
point

01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
at the subcommittee work session on
 
01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:06.199 align:start position:0%

questions but um
 
01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
I thank the committee for having
 
01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
retained the bill with the hope that we
 
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
could have made some fixes to it
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
um I have been in touch with the
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%

a place to actually
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
amend the bill in a way that it's going
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
to work and we hope that we're going to
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
be able to come back next year with
 
01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.110 align:start position:0%
be able to come back next year with
something

and um
 
01:58:34.850 --> 01:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
actually representative uh Raymond did

who's here today and also
 
01:58:46.970 --> 01:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
um uh former representative The
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
Honorable Betty gay about
 
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
um this bill and their concerns about
 
01:58:56.089 --> 01:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
the types of uh treatments and programs
 
01:58:59.810 --> 01:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
I'm using treatments Loosely uh programs
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
that are fall under the umbrella of
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
unification therapy and I'd like to
 
01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
suggest that we consider amending the
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
bill to add some specif specificity to
 
01:59:14.209 --> 01:59:14.219 align:start position:0%
what the concerns are that we have
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
um for what what types of activities
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
would fall under this umbrella that were
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about the judicial grants
 
01:59:24.530 --> 01:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
utilizing so my suggestion is that on
 
01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
the original bill on line six we simply
 
01:59:30.410 --> 01:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
strike through that last line so we keep
 
01:59:33.169 --> 01:59:33.179 align:start position:0%
the part of the bill that says
 
01:59:34.370 --> 01:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
um the course you'll give due
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
consideration to selecting a counselor
 
01:59:37.850 --> 01:59:37.860 align:start position:0%
who is recommended by the parties and is
 
01:59:39.649 --> 01:59:39.659 align:start position:0%
a a participating provider in the
 
01:59:42.770 --> 01:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
party's health insurance period and then
 
01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
I've had a handout we replaced the last
 
01:59:49.370 --> 01:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
line with the paragraph that you have in
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
front of you that says the court shall
 
01:59:52.250 --> 01:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
not order family communication
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
treatments programs or services
 
01:59:55.790 --> 01:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to camps
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
workshops therapeutic Vacations or
 
02:00:00.169 --> 02:00:00.179 align:start position:0%
educational programs that as a condition
 
02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
of enrollment or participation require
 
02:00:04.370 --> 02:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
or results in any of the following a no
 
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:06.540 align:start position:0%

02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
or multi-day stay a transfer of physical
 
02:00:12.169 --> 02:00:12.179 align:start position:0%

02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%

02:00:17.629 --> 02:00:17.639 align:start position:0%

02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%

02:00:21.649 --> 02:00:21.659 align:start position:0%
circumstances or circumstances that
 
02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:24.060 align:start position:0%
place the safety of the child at risk or
 
02:00:26.209 --> 02:00:26.219 align:start position:0%
five the use of threats physical Force
 
02:00:28.729 --> 02:00:28.739 align:start position:0%

02:00:30.530 --> 02:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
from the child's family community or
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
other sources of support or other
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
acutely distressing circumstances and I
 
02:00:37.010 --> 02:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
think number five really gets to the
 
02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
Crux of the concerns about some of the
 
02:00:43.609 --> 02:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
services being provided Under the
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
Umbrella of reunification therapy that
 
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
um I think not just country not just in
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire But Country ride and even
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
internationally we're finding that kids
 
02:00:57.290 --> 02:00:57.300 align:start position:0%
are being subjected to a lot of these
 
02:00:59.330 --> 02:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
behaviors and it's harming them and so
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that when judges
 
02:01:03.410 --> 02:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
are trying to repair family
 
02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
relationships that they don't
 
02:01:08.410 --> 02:01:08.420 align:start position:0%
accidentally stray into making orders
 
02:01:12.169 --> 02:01:12.179 align:start position:0%
for services that in the end end up
 
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
hurting kids
 
02:01:16.609 --> 02:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
so and I know that the prime sponsor and
 
02:01:19.129 --> 02:01:19.139 align:start position:0%

02:01:19.139 --> 02:01:20.149 align:start position:0%

that so
 
02:01:32.330 --> 02:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative is there something uh you
 
02:01:34.729 --> 02:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
want to add to that or just give us your
 
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:42.649 --> 02:01:42.659 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you're going to come up and
 
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
good hello um Francis Nutter Upham um
 
02:01:58.729 --> 02:01:58.739 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 8 Nashua Health and Human
 
02:01:58.739 --> 02:01:59.990 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 8 Nashua Health and Human
Services

02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
Services
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
um what was lacking in my original bill
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
was it clear definition of what
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
um reunification therapy was
 
02:02:12.169 --> 02:02:12.179 align:start position:0%
and you've given the definition that you
 
02:02:13.930 --> 02:02:13.940 align:start position:0%
found that's been used by other states
 
02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
gives a clear definition of of what
 
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
can't happen because uh in the initial
 
02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:23.639 align:start position:0%
hearing for the bill many people got up
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
and said well what's wrong with a
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
therapist trying to put a family back
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
together and I'm like well no nothing's
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
wrong with that that's a good idea
 
02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
um but so then I realized there's like
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
good reunification therapy and the evil
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy so we we want to
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
pass a law against the misuse of
 
02:02:45.119 --> 02:02:46.010 align:start position:0%
pass a law against the misuse of
um

02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
court orders
 
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
affecting families badly and with
 
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
another bill I put in in another
 
02:02:54.060 --> 02:02:55.490 align:start position:0%
another bill I put in in another
committee

02:02:55.490 --> 02:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:02:59.570 --> 02:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
um having courts order families to put
 
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
their children in therapy like real
 
02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
therapy but not on their insurance plan
 
02:03:10.609 --> 02:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
um makes financial hardship and nor do I
 
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
think they have well maybe judges have
 
02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
rights to do whatever they want I don't
 
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
know but none of us would really like it
 
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
if someone said well you can't go to the
 
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
doctor that's on your plan you have to
 
02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
pay out of pocket when you have a plan
 
02:03:26.810 --> 02:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
that should pay for whatever it is that
 
02:03:30.850 --> 02:03:30.860 align:start position:0%
you need so the having a good definition
 
02:03:33.709 --> 02:03:33.719 align:start position:0%
the coverage for that whoever the
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
therapist is
 
02:03:38.930 --> 02:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
um is a real therapist you know a bona
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
fide therapist and I'd like to I am a
 
02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
therapist I'd like to trust that
 
02:03:43.980 --> 02:03:45.410 align:start position:0%
therapist I'd like to trust that
um

02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:49.550 --> 02:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
State licensed social workers Mental
 
02:03:51.770 --> 02:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
Health Counselors licensed clinical
 
02:03:54.609 --> 02:03:54.619 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors family and
 
02:03:59.209 --> 02:03:59.219 align:start position:0%
family counselors would not engage in a
 
02:04:01.550 --> 02:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
destructive kind of therapy as what
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to um
 
02:04:06.169 --> 02:04:06.179 align:start position:0%
pass a law against
 
02:04:09.649 --> 02:04:09.659 align:start position:0%
is that clear yeah so um so I'm very
 
02:04:11.570 --> 02:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
pleased with the amendment thank you
 
02:04:13.390 --> 02:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:04:17.209 --> 02:04:17.219 align:start position:0%
I would like to ask representative
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
um a question sure thank you for taking
 
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
my question uh would you be willing to
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
add also
 
02:04:27.050 --> 02:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
um I just learned about forensic
 
02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:28.430 align:start position:0%
um I just learned about forensic
therapists

02:04:28.430 --> 02:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
therapists
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
is there a way we can add this to the
 
02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
bill so they don't you to the amendment
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
so they will not be using
 
02:04:40.010 --> 02:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
that type of therapy can be specifics so
 
02:04:45.169 --> 02:04:45.179 align:start position:0%
I would have to look up exactly the
 
02:04:48.010 --> 02:04:48.020 align:start position:0%
parameters of a forensic
 
02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:49.570 align:start position:0%
parameters of a forensic
therapists

02:04:49.570 --> 02:04:49.580 align:start position:0%
therapists
 
02:04:51.890 --> 02:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
scope of practice and we could just call
 
02:04:55.609 --> 02:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
Mel Moran because he does that and um
 
02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh he's a former rep and a social work
 
02:05:00.169 --> 02:05:00.179 align:start position:0%
and I know that
 
02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
he gets called upon to evaluate a child
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
or or an adult for a one-time thing
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
to see if they're going to go into
 
02:05:14.450 --> 02:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
prison or treatment so I would need to
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
do a tiny bit of research to know and
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
then if your understanding of it that
 
02:05:22.609 --> 02:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
they are doing some kind of therapy then
 
02:05:25.609 --> 02:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
maybe I wouldn't at all be adverse to
 
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
adding that sentences but I just want to
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
be sure I've defined it correctly
 
02:05:33.530 --> 02:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that forensic
 
02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
therapy is just investigative work it's
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
not really therapy it's just not like
 
02:05:42.770 --> 02:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
what you mean weekly it's not one-on-one
 
02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
clinical therapy it's just investigating
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
what's wrong it's not really treating
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
the problem that's why
 
02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
I'm saying to add not to allow forensic
 
02:05:58.189 --> 02:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
therapy we want to treat the problem if
 
02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to have them pay for
 
02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
treatment we want it to be effective
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
treatment not just more investigative
 
02:06:07.790 --> 02:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
work we want clinical work done right
 
02:06:10.250 --> 02:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
but I suppose we don't want to pass a
 
02:06:10.260 --> 02:06:12.830 align:start position:0%
but I suppose we don't want to pass a
law

02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
um preventing someone from doing
 
02:06:16.850 --> 02:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
forensic research that they need to do
 
02:06:19.550 --> 02:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
into a family's case this is just about
 
02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
clinical this this is just fundamental
 
02:06:26.689 --> 02:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
just so right but what's happening is
 
02:06:29.570 --> 02:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
my understanding and I the way I
 
02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
understood it is that some of the
 
02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
forensic therapists are being
 
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
presented as being clinical therapist
 
02:06:39.770 --> 02:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
and they're not they're just forensic
 
02:06:43.609 --> 02:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
therapists so I am I'm concerned could
 
02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond and I do a little
 
02:06:46.729 --> 02:06:46.739 align:start position:0%
more research on that that would be
 
02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
awesome thank you in the next 10 minutes
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
before since we have time to put this
 
02:06:52.669 --> 02:06:52.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for your
 
02:06:54.169 --> 02:06:54.179 align:start position:0%
concerns yeah they're very valid
 
02:06:56.450 --> 02:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
representative Greg did you have uh yeah
 
02:06:58.010 --> 02:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
I was just looking up really quick on
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
the um forensic psychologist and when
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
they might be utilized to a forensic
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
psychologist has a knowledge of not only
 
02:07:08.089 --> 02:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
um human behavior and stuff but also
 
02:07:10.609 --> 02:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
within the court so it kind of it's a a
 
02:07:12.729 --> 02:07:12.739 align:start position:0%
time when say there's
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or severe accusations
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
of that that they might use a forensic
 
02:07:19.070 --> 02:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
therapist to do that not to actually to
 
02:07:21.649 --> 02:07:21.659 align:start position:0%
perform the therapy but to actually work
 
02:07:23.950 --> 02:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
within the system as far as
 
02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
figuring out what to do in a particular
 
02:07:29.089 --> 02:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
case so I don't I don't see where
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're being used to is like a
 
02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
therapist you have a particular case or
 
02:07:37.209 --> 02:07:37.219 align:start position:0%
no I went to a zoom meeting
 
02:07:41.570 --> 02:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
and they were talking about how forensic
 
02:07:43.609 --> 02:07:43.619 align:start position:0%
therapists are being promoted as
 
02:07:46.490 --> 02:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
clinical therapists and that's not what
 
02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
their job is okay so that would they're
 
02:07:51.169 --> 02:07:51.179 align:start position:0%
not treating the condition they're just
 
02:07:52.970 --> 02:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
doing the investigating nor is that
 
02:07:55.609 --> 02:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
ethical because to treat right
 
02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
I have a child and her husband are both
 
02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
psychologists but they are not clinical
 
02:08:05.689 --> 02:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
psychologists so they would be unethical
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
for them to treat someone you know
 
02:08:11.089 --> 02:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
weekly that they ended up being College
 
02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
professors and um and there's there's a
 
02:08:17.290 --> 02:08:17.300 align:start position:0%
lot of jobs for that but without a
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
clinical license to treat people you
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
can't treat people it's unethical to do
 
02:08:27.770 --> 02:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
so so let us um look a little further
 
02:08:29.810 --> 02:08:29.820 align:start position:0%
into the
 
02:08:32.209 --> 02:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
the hard definition of a forensic
 
02:08:34.370 --> 02:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
psychologist who can make
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
recommendations for something but they
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
don't do clinical treatment so just that
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
we're sure on that and it may already be
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
covered but we'll look into it all right
 
02:08:44.689 --> 02:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative Greg did
 
02:08:46.729 --> 02:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
you have yeah just a quick follow-up the
 
02:08:48.169 --> 02:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
other thing is too I think that we
 
02:08:50.089 --> 02:08:50.099 align:start position:0%
already covered this only because I know
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
a forensic psychologist would not be
 
02:08:55.010 --> 02:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
covered under plans and stuff so by
 
02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
saying that we cannot have somebody that
 
02:08:59.689 --> 02:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
is not covered under a plan we're
 
02:09:01.370 --> 02:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
actually already covering it without
 
02:09:03.709 --> 02:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
saying it because they can't be charged
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:11.450 --> 02:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if anybody had questions
 
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know I tried to cover everything in
 
02:09:16.129 --> 02:09:16.139 align:start position:0%
that email
 
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:22.250 --> 02:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you well thank you and I'm sorry
 
02:09:24.530 --> 02:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
any uh further
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
sure okay yesterday officials so I
 
02:09:39.530 --> 02:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
really like how thorough this amendment
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
is and I think it does speak to the
 
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
original uh kind of theme that
 
02:09:47.209 --> 02:09:47.219 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter Upham was going
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
for so I really think this strengthens
 
02:09:50.810 --> 02:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
it and and brings us into something that
 
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
we can take to the full committee
 
02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:55.209 align:start position:0%
we can take to the full committee
foreign

02:09:55.209 --> 02:09:55.219 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:09:58.129 --> 02:09:58.139 align:start position:0%
like representative Nutter Upham pointed
 
02:09:58.139 --> 02:09:59.330 align:start position:0%
like representative Nutter Upham pointed
out

02:09:59.330 --> 02:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:10:02.089 --> 02:10:02.099 align:start position:0%
um we didn't spell out what what
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy was and in fact
 
02:10:08.209 --> 02:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
that is really an issue because the
 
02:10:10.729 --> 02:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
courts use the term
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
and it it sounds so different from what
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
it is in practice and the courts use it
 
02:10:18.290 --> 02:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
and the insurance knows what it is
 
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
because they say we won't pay for it so
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's nice to have it spelled out
 
02:10:28.010 --> 02:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
but that the way they practice it
 
02:10:31.609 --> 02:10:31.619 align:start position:0%
so any other questions on or questions
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
on this proposed language
 
02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:37.310 align:start position:0%
on this proposed language
um

02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah it's not an amendment but it
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
is uh proposed language if if I'll
 
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
insane emotion that we all agree with
 
02:10:49.490 --> 02:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
bringing this proposed language as an
 
02:10:53.149 --> 02:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:56.570 --> 02:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
sure okay I make a motion that we all
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
that we are we going to vote on it that
 
02:10:59.930 --> 02:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
we all agree that this is good language
 
02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
to take to the full committee
 
02:11:03.649 --> 02:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
to amend this bill
 
02:11:07.609 --> 02:11:07.619 align:start position:0%
and I second it okay so uh
 
02:11:09.290 --> 02:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know where to put it on this
 
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
paper I get but I'll put it somewhere so
 
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative Greg what is it 10 30.
 
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
and representative uh panic
 
02:11:21.169 --> 02:11:21.179 align:start position:0%
okay panic
 
02:11:31.870 --> 02:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.490 --> 02:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
to be brought in the form of an
 
02:11:37.910 --> 02:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
amendment by representative uh
 
02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:39.530 align:start position:0%
amendment by representative uh
uh

02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:41.810 --> 02:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh Raymond
 
02:11:41.820 --> 02:11:43.129 align:start position:0%
uh Raymond
okay

02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:43.139 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
so uh any further discussion
 
02:11:50.089 --> 02:11:50.099 align:start position:0%
CNN all those in favor saying the Bible
 
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
saying aye aye all those opposed the
 
02:11:54.169 --> 02:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
eyes have it
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh so it's five of us one two three four
 
02:12:00.649 --> 02:12:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
can ask just a procedural question sure
 
02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'm showing my novice nature here so
 
02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
um when I bring this to
 
02:12:20.209 --> 02:12:20.219 align:start position:0%
um oh well OLS OLS does the entire
 
02:12:22.850 --> 02:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
committee's name go on it does just my
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
name does the prime sponsor uh
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
no yeah they'll make it happen it's
