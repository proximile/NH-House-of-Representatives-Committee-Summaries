representative oh i was going to make
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:43.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
so it is
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
made and seconded do you want to speak i
 
00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:48.469 align:start position:0%
made and seconded do you want to speak i
can

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
since i was planning on saying something
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
i i i could
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
so this is a bill that we we heard in
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
public testimony essentially would
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
reproduce in rsa
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
what is already the policy of the
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
under um
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
under more more general uh guidance from
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
the rsas
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
so from that standpoint i
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
would be redundant and not necessary and
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
so with the agreement of the sponsor
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative huff
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.829 align:start position:0%
public hearing
and

00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
um therefore has made himself available
 
00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:41.269 align:start position:0%
um therefore has made himself available
today

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
if you have a
 
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.269 align:start position:0%
if you have a
statement

00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
that you can make and and be able to
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
answer some questions on that i think
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful to the committee
 
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.310 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful to the committee
there

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful to our committee
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my name is chris
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
nicholopoulos and i'm commissioner of
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
insurance and it's so nice to be back at
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
the state house uh
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
you know it's been two years
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
of of covid hayes and it's nice to be
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
back here um
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
the department of insurance is really
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
excited about the family medical leave
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
proposal that was included in the budget
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
and our team along with several other
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
state departments has been working
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
really hard
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
to get that rfp ready and out
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh i think the the bill that came that
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
came out of the budget was a phenomenal
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
compromise and really is the new
 
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire way
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
to address a nationwide
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
desire to deal with family medical leave
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
availability we've seen a number of
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
states pass
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
state mandated programs
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
mandated on everyone we here in new
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire i think twice passed an income
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
tax to fund a family medical aid program
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
and this this program that was developed
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
is a voluntary program available to
 
00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.269 align:start position:0%
is a voluntary program available to
everyone

00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
in part uh kicked off by the 10 000
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
employees of state government
 
00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:05.910 align:start position:0%
employees of state government
and

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
will make both individual plans
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
available and group market plans
 
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.590 align:start position:0%
available and group market plans
available

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
in a time where
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
that coverage
 
00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
didn't otherwise exist a private market
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
insurance company offering a full family
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
medical leave product um
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
didn't exist when this bill passed and
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
in fact we've had our first filing for
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
what will be a competing product a
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
family medical leave product filed by
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
nationwide this last year it is not
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it is not the same product
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
it is not uh does not provide first
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
person coverage is a group only product
 
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
isn't any there's not an individual
 
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.710 align:start position:0%
isn't any there's not an individual
solution

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
um there's no tap in fact there's no uh
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
tax credit either um
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
and we're at a critical time the rp will
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
be going out soon
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful that many companies will bid
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
on this product and i think the this
 
00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:55.839 align:start position:0%
innovative solution
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
to a nationwide desire
 
00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.829 align:start position:0%
to a nationwide desire
is

00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
a question you mentioned
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
the nationwide plan and some of the
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
things that doesn't have first-person
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
coverage there were some other terms
 
00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:14.310 align:start position:0%
coverage there were some other terms
that

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
us not being familiar with insurance
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
maybe you could explain it in more
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
detail so first person coverages is for
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
the employee and so the nationwide
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
product is a family support uh product
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
and so that if you needed to to be at a
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointment or cancer treatment
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
with your kids you would have a coverage
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
for that but if you needed it for
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
yourself it would not be wage
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
replacement for that and so that's when
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
i talk about first person coverage and
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
is obviously a critical part
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
to it so it's it's kind of half of the
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
sandwich the you know the family support
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
part but not the not the first person
 
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.550 align:start position:0%
part but not the not the first person
coverage

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh when i talk about group i mean this
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
product will be marketed to employers to
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
provide to their to their staff but
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
would not be available to
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
a single person looking to have it for
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
themselves and their family
 
00:16:04.959 --> 00:16:05.910 align:start position:0%
themselves and their family
um

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's the difference it's
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative pro
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
so you said that the the product that
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
you've seen started to come out doesn't
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
have first person coverage is that
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
because that would really be the
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
territory of short-term disability in
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
that type of insurance that already
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
exists for a lot of people
 
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.350 align:start position:0%
exists for a lot of people
um

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful question representative in
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
part the answer to that is yes the
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
simple answer is yes if you
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh if you combined a short term policy
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
and a family medical leave policy that
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
excluded first-person coverage uh
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
possibly you could kind of have an
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
amalgamation of different policies that
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
made that coverage
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
when that happens when you try to put
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
together lots of parts what you end up
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
with unfortunately is
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
inefficiency you're managing two
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
policies for the potential same loss and
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
you also potentially end up with
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
different definitions
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
of what uh what
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
what a serious medical condition could
 
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.069 align:start position:0%
what a serious medical condition could
be

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
um you could end up with different
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
requirements regarding a coordination of
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
benefits which is
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
part of
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
kind of this policy development is how
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
you coordinate benefits
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
do you require an eligible employee to
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
use their second vacation time first do
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
you require them in fact to use a
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
short-term product that might be
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
available to you
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
it could be achieved but it is not a
 
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
seamless one solution pick up one policy
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the answer um does
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
nationwide offer short-term disability
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
and is do you think they're trying to
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
design this as two policies that they
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
both offer for a company to kind of
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
choose a la carte and make a
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
a nice looking
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
uh benefits package for employees is
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
that something that you can see
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
happening is two policies from the same
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
company meshing better
 
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.830 align:start position:0%
company meshing better
um

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
nation first question yes they offer a
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
variety of policies including certain
 
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.350 align:start position:0%
variety of policies including certain
coverage

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
they're looking at it as a a cart
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
thing it's just too early to tell
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
what that will look like
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
and even with that because those
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
products are approved separately the
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
forms are approved separately the
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
underwriting will be different the teams
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
that that kind of manage each type of
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
policy each type of claim are different
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
um and so i do expect that once this
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
product gets off the ground that we may
 
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.029 align:start position:0%
product gets off the ground that we may
see

00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive solutions that compete
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
with the state product i hope that we'll
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
see that
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
i expect that we'll see that
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
but i think creating
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
this model model that we're we're in the
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
middle of creating and finalizing
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
is going to be the impetus for um
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
fully providing
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
what we think of as kind of the minimum
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
level of coverage with all the
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility to add on
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
so that these
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
whether you're the selected um
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
successful uh provider for this this
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
product or you're a competitor you're
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
going to have the flexibility to add on
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
more than the minimum um
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a phenomenal
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
catalyst and we're starting to get calls
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
from around the nation because this is
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
this isn't the appropriate approach
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative bartlett
 
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:39.990 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative bartlett
please

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
welcome commissioner um i just want to
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
make clear that you are speaking in
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill is that correct
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm speaking i'm hoping very
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
much that you don't ought to pass a bill
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
to unwind this critical program right
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
before we go out to rmp thank you for
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan followed by
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
first of all i believe any family paid
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
family medical leave is better than no
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
paid family medical leave um but that
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
said um
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
how concerned are you about um adverse
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
election when
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
especially with regard to the
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who choose um
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
to take it or not to take it um i can
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
see how um the the group coverage where
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
an entire company covers all their
 
00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.909 align:start position:0%
an entire company covers all their
employees

00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
wouldn't involve adverse selection but
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
if i'm out there independent and i
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
decide to take it
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
isn't that a risk
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
100 percent it's a risk when you have an
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
individual product that people can opt
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
in one at a time
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
that that group may be more likely to
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
take a claim
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
than uh than a group
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know somebody who seeks out this
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
coverage for themselves themself
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
probably has a reason to do that
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
maybe they're in the child-rearing years
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
maybe they're worried about
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
care for
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
some one of their family members
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
and i think the critical part of why
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
is viable and why i believe
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
several companies will bid on the rp is
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
because using the three pots the three
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
groups that are going to be covered here
 
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
the state employees as kind of the
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
kickoff start
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
the group policies that people can sign
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
up for
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
and the individual policy is going to
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
allow a company to offer to kind of
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
bake in
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
in their under in their rating
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
for all three and in time as this as the
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
years go on you know three four five
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
years in we're gonna figure that out
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
we're gonna figure out um
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
if if there is adverse selection
 
00:21:53.919 --> 00:21:55.190 align:start position:0%
if if there is adverse selection
um

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
and also i think we're also gonna figure
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
out you know two three years in
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
um because we've heard for five years
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
now how critical this coverage is
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
people want it
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
and once we get this program off the
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
ground we're gonna see
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
if if they're willing to actually get it
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
and and how it works uh i i suspect um
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
as do the experts in my office that it
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be embraced
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
um but uh and
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
i also agree with the position that
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
uh something is better than nothing i
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
think having a tool a comprehensive
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
product that's available to consumers to
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
buy is better than where we are
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
today which
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative mandeville thank you uh
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.510 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
um

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
as i understand it i'm new to this
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
process uh you have an rfp out
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
relative to the plan
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
time frames
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
for the rfp in terms of its start and
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
close time
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
and what in general terms will the
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
department's criteria be
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
qualifications for
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
a potential acceptance of one of the
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
proposals i should also ask too is it
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh the department that will make the
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
final decision among the plans proposed
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
perfect uh so i'm glad you asked that
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
question because i think it's important
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
that we clarify that the rfp is not
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
coming out from the insurance department
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
but it's coming up from department
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
now administrative services is working
 
00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:40.310 align:start position:0%
now administrative services is working
with

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
five four or five state departments to
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
figure this out
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
and so there will be a panel
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
of experts to help
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh score the policies uh there are a
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
couple of there are
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
irrespective of the scoring there are
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
safeguards and one of the primary
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
safeguards is ultimately that my
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
department approves
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
the company the company who wants to
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
sell this product needs to be a licensed
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
and a viable company in new hampshire
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
which means we've we've
 
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.110 align:start position:0%
which means we've we've
we've

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
investigated and approved their finances
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
and their their structure
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
the form the form of each policy will
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
need to be approved by my team the team
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
of department that reuse forms
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
and in preparation for that the
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
department has
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
worked on our rules that will kind of
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
govern what the forum and policies will
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
look like that's been sent out to uh to
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
industry groups for feedback
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
the rfp is going out soon i don't know
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
31st before the 31st
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
and then it'll be several weeks and
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
we'll get back and and the people will
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
i hope that's enough of an answer
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh if if i may follow up just quickly
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
will one of the
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh criteria be
 
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.470 align:start position:0%
uh criteria be
a

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
rating a company rating and if so
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
it will i don't believe the rfp requires
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
a rating though i've
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
not verified that stat to be to be a
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
licensed new hampshire authorized either
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
domestic or foreign insurance company
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
generally that requires a a minus rating
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
with uh with bests it now that's not the
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
same for every company there are comp
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
there are smaller companies that don't
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
have a best rating that have a a minus
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
rated parent and through some guarantees
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
further questions representative avaloni
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner for being here today uh can
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
you define what a group is
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh a group is a employer group
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
simply um
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
so maybe an employer
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
as an employer how many employees would
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
you need to be part of the employer
 
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.510 align:start position:0%
you need to be part of the employer
group

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.029 align:start position:0%
group
two

00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
does that include
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
does that include the owner and
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
employees or is it technically employees
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
would it be a 40-hour
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:12.950 align:start position:0%
you know
minimum

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.750 align:start position:0%
minimum
i

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of experts drafting the
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
definitions i believe it would be any
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
two employees whether they're owners or
 
00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.950 align:start position:0%
two employees whether they're owners or
not

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
could be a group okay and one can you
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
tell me how this is funded
 
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.029 align:start position:0%
tell me how this is funded
uh

00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:30.310 align:start position:0%
uh
primarily

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
primarily
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
it it's funded through the the premiums
 
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
that will be charged um now i say that
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of factors here
 
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
there's a factor um of which the startup
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
cost to kind of get the rfp going and
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
get the experts supporting the state i
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
was funded by general fund
 
00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.590 align:start position:0%
was funded by general fund
um

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
bt tax
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
credit to offset some of the employers
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
portion that they pay
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
so that's funded and ultimately 10 000
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
state employees will be covered under
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
this product and that will be a benefit
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.549 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner for being here uh follow up
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
on uh representative avalani's um the
 
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:24.870 align:start position:0%
on uh representative avalani's um the
ten

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
ten
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred eleven thousand
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
state employees that are going to be
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
covered how is that funded whose pays
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
for that uh
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
the state the state will be paying for
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
that under the from the employees
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
benefits line item um and that that
 
00:27:38.559 --> 00:27:39.430 align:start position:0%
benefits line item um and that that
group

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
um because because of the draft of the
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
bill that passed uh the state employees
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
don't have first person coverage and
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's because the state benefit package
 
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
is such that they already have that
 
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.269 align:start position:0%
is such that they already have that
coverage

00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
and so the state group
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
cheaper ultimately we'll see when the rp
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
comes out but it should be cheaper than
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh than the traditional products that
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
will be on the sides of it
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
um but that will you know for my
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
department it will be funded from our
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
administrative assessment
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
through uh staff salaries i
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
it should not
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
i guess a lot of money is is it depends
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
on who's saying those words but
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
should not be allowed
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
so in effect you're saying that uh the
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would be actually funding
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
indirectly the cost of the state
 
00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:31.510 align:start position:0%
indirectly the cost of the state
employees

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
yeah like all state benefits
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
well in my in my case the department is
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
funded with administrative assessment on
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
but who pays for insurance companies i
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
guess the insureds and those are
 
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.669 align:start position:0%
guess the insureds and those are
taxpayers

00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:49.430 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
follow

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
for the state employees that are covered
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
by collective bargaining agreements
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
would that require bargaining it does
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
not it does not thank you
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
follow it
 
00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:02.070 align:start position:0%
follow it
um

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
there were two bills this year
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
to remove fmli
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
one in this committee and one in
 
00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:09.830 align:start position:0%
one in this committee and one in
commerce

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
i was in this one when it was presented
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
and i was also
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
testified in the commerce committee
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
i'm curious as to why nobody from your
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
department was at either one of those
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
public hearings and why at the last
 
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.110 align:start position:0%
public hearings and why at the last
minute

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
minute
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
we are hearing from you now thank you uh
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
i i apologize that i wasn't uh here i i
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
in fact for your committee meeting i was
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
traveling out of state
 
00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.350 align:start position:0%
traveling out of state
um

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.789 align:start position:0%
um
i

00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
wrongfully assumed
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
i wrongfully assumed that other people
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
who were interested would be here to say
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
all these things
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
and when i heard they weren't i
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
made the offer to
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
uh to both chairmen that i would make
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
myself available um
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
i think it's clear today i'm passionate
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
about this proposal i think
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
as a regulator i want this product to
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
succeed because i want this product to
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
i'll take the responsibility for that
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative prout
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
following up on your answer to
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte you said that
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
the benefit available to state employees
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't include first-person coverage
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
is that unique to the coverage for state
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
employees do we have two different
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
products being bid on one for state
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
employees and a
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
separate distinct product
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
for everyone else
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
could you explain that a little bit more
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
it ultimately won
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
the r1rp and one bidder who will provide
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
three kind of
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
three buckets of coverages
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
almost the exact exact same
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's the individual pool
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
the state pool and the group pool
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
the state pool
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
because we know
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
we know exactly what their coverages are
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
and their benefits we were able to
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
exclude the first person coverage
 
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.070 align:start position:0%
exclude the first person coverage
because

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
because we're in charge of that we're
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
able to mesh those exactly
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
and we're drafting the rfp around that
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
and so it was
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
to provide first-person coverage where
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
they already had it and so that was
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
carved out of the state employees
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
was that the only question or did i miss
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
the second one
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
um i guess my question was if a
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
employer a non-state employer already
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
has first-person coverage either through
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
an insurance contract they're happy with
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
if they've chosen to self-insured and
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know through other
 
00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.070 align:start position:0%
you know through other
benefits

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
would they
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
have the option of getting a plan
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
similar to the state plan is or is their
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
only option
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
terminating their existing self uh short
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
term disability benefit and going with
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
the whole package if they want to
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
i believe the answer to that question is
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
if they want to participate
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
in a product provided under this
 
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.389 align:start position:0%
in a product provided under this
program

00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
they would they would get the first
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
person coverage within this program
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
now that does it because this is an
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
option and no employer is required to
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
get this
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
they they could kind of build that
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
policy at least to some extent with the
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
nationwide and the short-term disability
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
um because it's not as efficient to do
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
that and because the tax credit
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
available to these businesses is
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
available for the state approved product
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's going to be the
 
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.110 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's going to be the
case

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
until until the marketplace has
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
developed sufficiently that
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
all of the unknowns all of the adverse
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
selection unknowns are are known
 
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.909 align:start position:0%
selection unknowns are are known
um

00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
that it'll be hard to compete with the
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh
 
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:54.950 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh
so

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
just to clarify one thing you said if
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
they try to build their own product to
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
keep their existing short-term
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
disability assuming they had it they
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be eligible for the tax credits
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
that were in
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
what was passed in the budget
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
if they
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
adopt if michael if i'm understanding
 
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
your question you're asking if they did
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
if they adopted to find fmli
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
coverage um family coverage outside of
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
the approved product
 
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.230 align:start position:0%
the approved product
um

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
they would not they would not be able
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
i'll recognize representative schiller
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um thank you very
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
much for being here commissioner and
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
i would like to dial back to a statement
 
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
you made a few
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
answers ago
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
for clarification because i i don't
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
think i
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think i heard you correctly um i
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
are you
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
stating that state employees coverage
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
you had said will be paid by the state
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
because it's my understanding that state
 
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.990 align:start position:0%
because it's my understanding that state
employees

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
will be paying for this coverage
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
themselves we're not
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
that is not a state benefit that is a
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
benefit offered to the employees
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
to pay for themselves
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
or the department that yeah working for
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
it will not be charged to the employees
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative babalani
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you commissioner again um why
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
only one company for this product
 
00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:46.069 align:start position:0%
only one company for this product
um

00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
good question it's a complex it's a it's
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
a complicated
 
00:34:50.079 --> 00:34:51.109 align:start position:0%
a complicated
uh

00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
product that we're building with the
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
three parts um
 
00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:55.589 align:start position:0%
three parts um
and

00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
and the kind of the wild card
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
is what potential adverse selection they
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
will be in the individual market place
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
and that is offset by the state
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
employees in the group
 
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.630 align:start position:0%
employees in the group
um

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.589 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
we're confident that insurance companies
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
are sophisticated enough to figure that
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
out to make assumptions on on those risk
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
profiles given that it is it is a
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
limited benefit it's six weeks sixty
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
percent um
 
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.390 align:start position:0%
percent um
and

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
one having one company be able to to do
 
00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.550 align:start position:0%
one having one company be able to to do
that

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
for the for the whole product uh
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
initially is i think the best way to
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that you don't end up with
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
somebody having a product that is gets
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
all the adverse selection and somebody
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
who doesn't
 
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.910 align:start position:0%
who doesn't
um

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
because it will be a guaranteed issue
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.630 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
the

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
one company solution
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
other states
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
um i've worked in this bill several
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
times over the last two three or four
 
00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.829 align:start position:0%
times over the last two three or four
times

00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:36:03.839 --> 00:36:05.030 align:start position:0%
times
um

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
several other states have had a public
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
private partnership and they've offered
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
it through multiple companies have you
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
looked at their products or companies
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
and invited them in before
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
this bill came to be i mean it's been a
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
number of years we've been discussing
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
this and why hasn't a private option or
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
forgive me your office put this product
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
out to
 
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.550 align:start position:0%
out to
open

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
open open the doors to other companies
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
first off
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
i've followed this to
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
through the processes of of the two
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
income tax bills
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
i was not commissioner then and in fact
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
the the bill that most of this language
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
came from was drafted before i was at
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
the department i know they did an rfi
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
before that
 
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.230 align:start position:0%
before that
um

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you i'm i'm not aware
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
of a state that has a
 
00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.589 align:start position:0%
of a state that has a
a

00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
private public partnership
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
that issue that includes mandatory uh
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
an option for employers uh including the
 
00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.109 align:start position:0%
an option for employers uh including the
state

00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh i i believe we are blazing the path
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
for this solution i don't think somebody
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
um new york has a private option um have
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
you looked at their model
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
new york i thought new york had a
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
mandatory option
 
00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.430 align:start position:0%
mandatory option
um

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
and that's different
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know everybody has to have it but
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
you could get it from if you don't take
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
our program you get it from the
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
private market is different
 
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.910 align:start position:0%
private market is different
from

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
we make it available to everybody to
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
why haven't we done that to this point
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
and made it not it made it optional for
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
employees to buy into a program instead
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
of being mandated in other states being
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
on the hook to pay for this for a
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
certain segment of the population and
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
then have
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
a one company come in and draw the line
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
for everybody else
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
if your question is why aren't we
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
mandating that every employer buy this
 
00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:14.790 align:start position:0%
mandating that every employer buy this
coverage

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's what this program is
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
this program is exactly that
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
other than the state employees that the
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
state is deciding the option
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh everybody else is optional we're
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
creating we're creating a mechanism for
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
a company to produce exactly what we
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
want which is a product that covers
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
family medical leave here in new
 
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.230 align:start position:0%
family medical leave here in new
hampshire

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
that is entirely optional other than the
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
state employees but which
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
you all decided to put in the budget so
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
it is 100 optional
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman it'll be my final
 
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.910 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman it'll be my final
one

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
um right optional so why hasn't it been
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
done prior to this bill coming out
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
we've heard this for at least the last
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
10 years for fmli or a product that
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
would cover employers
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
employees i mean everybody has been
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
claiming for some for some option of
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
this and why hasn't been done to this
 
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.790 align:start position:0%
this and why hasn't been done to this
point

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
why isn't there an optional family
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
medical leave coverage that any
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
individual or group
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
could get
 
00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.670 align:start position:0%
could get
correct

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
because of adverse selection because if
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
you cr if you create if you insurance
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
company created a product and now
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
understand that ours also has a cap in
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
it to ensure that the rates are uh
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
obtainable for those individual market
 
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.150 align:start position:0%
obtainable for those individual market
participants

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
participants
 
00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.109 align:start position:0%
participants
um

00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know a company doesn't know that
 
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.910 align:start position:0%
you know a company doesn't know that
they're

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
not only going to get
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
the people who are going to take the
 
00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:41.349 align:start position:0%
the people who are going to take the
benefit

00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
and obviously it's a much more expensive
 
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.310 align:start position:0%
and obviously it's a much more expensive
product

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
one more
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i completely understand the
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
adverse selection but competition breeds
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
savings for
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
customers yeah and
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
this product will i believe will have
 
00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.190 align:start position:0%
this product will i believe will have
competition

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
competition
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
um i've had an opportunity to talk to a
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
number of companies that they could be
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
in this space on their own already
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
at some level and they're not good not
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
no one is going to adopt the individual
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
option plan
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
yet but uh that are talking about me
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
making a competing plan
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
or the ability to have a competing plan
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
if they either don't bid or aren't the
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
successful bidder and i think there will
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
be a lot of copycat plans
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
i hope there'll be a lot of copycat
 
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.430 align:start position:0%
i hope there'll be a lot of copycat
plans

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh first representative cahill and then
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative prout thank you mr chair
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you commissioner getting back
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
to mr pratt's question about an employer
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
who already has short-term disability if
 
00:40:45.839 --> 00:40:46.710 align:start position:0%
who already has short-term disability if
they

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
if they took the state plan as well or
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
sorry the group plan from the state
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
would it be a situation where there
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
would be a primary and a secondary
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
probably not and probably not because
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
um because our short-term policy and
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
this product
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
are the same coverage
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
what you will see
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
is employers who
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
either add endorsements to the state
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
plan to have potentially more weeks of
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
coverage or maybe even a higher weekly
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
return in the you know in the in the
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
group market uh but what we'll likely
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
see is that plenty of companies will
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
still opt for long-term coverage which
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner um
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
you said a moment ago in your answer
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
that uh you thought there would be
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
competition uh in the marketplace in
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
coming after this
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
um we've heard about a little bit about
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
the tax cuts now they're only available
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
to the winner of the state rfp
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
can you quantify in terms of what
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
percentage off the price you expect
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
those tax cuts to represent and
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
how you think there will be competition
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
from other companies
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
with a company that
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
does get that
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
um lower starting baseline because of
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
the tax credits and how other companies
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
could compete with that
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
in a i
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
assume as a low margin environment um so
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
i think the tax credit's 50
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
so that the answer is 50
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
but what that's not taking into account
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
at least initially
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
the unknowns of adverse election or
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
it may not be the best you know until
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
until it develops until
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
insurance companies know how to kind of
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate claims over a long period of
 
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.829 align:start position:0%
anticipate claims over a long period of
time

00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:42:49.839 --> 00:42:52.069 align:start position:0%
time
um

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
it may
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
and you're offsetting some of the group
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
payers with individual markets that they
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
must issue
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
it it
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
may be that a competitor could offer a
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
product or a
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
a cadillac version of it that has a lot
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
more coverages
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
or broader even broader definitions of
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
so i think the insurance companies are
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
innovative and they'll look at trying to
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative you had a question
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thanks again
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
for taking uh hopefully a couple
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions here uh one comment and
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
we've been talking a lot about what
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
adverse selection and
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
that sort of
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
opting in
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
i too have been involved with several of
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
these fmli uh in labor committee and the
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
last one that i was involved with was
 
00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:52.230 align:start position:0%
last one that i was involved with was
the

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
one put forward by senator feltus and in
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
that one that was a going to be a
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory for everybody
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
as that
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
process progressed
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
that was not found to be a very
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
popular plan
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
individuals started looking at an opt-in
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
program which made it
 
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.910 align:start position:0%
program which made it
extremely

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.589 align:start position:0%
extremely
impossible

00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
to go and the reason why is
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
just as you mentioned you brought up the
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
example of the individual and it was
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
always the easy one to to utilize
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
because it was a time frame and that was
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who knew they were going to
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
become pregnant
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
and we determined back then that
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
somebody could put in as little as a
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
couple hundred dollars in
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
in uh premiums and take out several
 
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.069 align:start position:0%
in uh premiums and take out several
thousand

00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
um so what happens is when you go to an
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
opt-in program like that you what ends
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
up happening is it it collapses or
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
becomes so prohibitively expensive
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
that nobody
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
nobody does it
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
the question i have uh next would be
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
that was my statement this the question
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
have we qua have you quantified the 50
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
tax credit that this would give to
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
employers what what the total loss of
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
income tax
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
the difference
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
because you mentioned the the feltes
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
plan which is i think the last one that
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
passed the legislature that was a half a
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
percent income tax
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh or a fee
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
half a percent on wages
 
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
for a product that was mandatory for
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
everyone i believe the last version that
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
and and the state was on the state was
 
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
the insurance company in that in that
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
method and so that meant
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
if something like you know imagine
 
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
if the uh the feltest plan
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
that we we last was last vetoed had
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
passed and something like covid19 hit
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
the warhold
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
there potentially would have been lots
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
of of claims for
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
in that period that we wouldn't have
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
anticipated and the state was the
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
insurance company and i think my fear at
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
that point was the state is not in the
 
00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.349 align:start position:0%
that point was the state is not in the
business

00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:46:17.359 --> 00:46:18.309 align:start position:0%
business
of

00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh of setting rates for its own product
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
and certainly
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
with all the restricted legislature i
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't think deciding that a half a
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
percent income tax and this benefit is
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to be enough was prudent
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
and using a private insurance company a
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
a viable private insurance company who
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
can do that and will take the upside and
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
downside risk
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.670 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
when you say we would take the upside
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
and downside risk are you talking about
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers or uh i'm saying that
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
this plan that's in front of us has an
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
insurance company taking the upside in
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
downside risk under the the last plan
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
that that passed the feltes plan the
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
state was taking the upside and downside
 
00:47:05.119 --> 00:47:09.670 align:start position:0%
state was taking the upside and downside
risk

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the statement you said
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
before you said that people want this
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
how many
 
00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.630 align:start position:0%
how many
uh

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
employers in the state have actually
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
come to the insurance department and
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
asked hey we really want this for our
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
employers and
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
out of those who came and asked how many
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
have not gone out in the private sector
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
and actually looked at doing it thank
 
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.790 align:start position:0%
and actually looked at doing it thank
you

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.990 align:start position:0%
you
so

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't calculate uh
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
employers coming into church department
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
asking but that that's not typically how
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
it would work i attended the hearings
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
where people were in the halls holding
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
the you know we want this sign
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
i know that a lot of employers in new
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire self-fund this already you
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
know employers that have leave for
 
00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.190 align:start position:0%
know employers that have leave for
for

00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
births or leave for short short leaves
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
or a comprehensive vacation and a sick
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
packages that build up and they
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
providing a product like this will allow
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
employers and the reason i believe a
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
group of players will adopt this is
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
because they'll be able to for those
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
that are self-insuring part of this risk
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
they may be using short-term disability
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
for part but they'll be able to get a
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.589 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
commissioner

00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for uh
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
spending your time with us this morning
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
though it felt like a little bit of an
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
inquisition it was so nice to be back
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
that i appreciate it i hope i i hope i
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
was helpful and i'm sorry for not being
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.270 align:start position:0%
thank you again

i would like
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
republicans have heard some new
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
information and i think we'd like to
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
ask for a 10-minute caucus
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
just to discuss
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
what we've heard today
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
so if we could
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
plan to be back in here between noon and
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
i almost lost an hour there 11 and 5
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
after and we can
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
pick up again where we left off
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
plan i call
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
representative proud i apologize

the floor is ought to pass on house bill
 
00:59:04.799 --> 00:59:06.470 align:start position:0%
the floor is ought to pass on house bill
1165

00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
1165
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
potions made by representative prout
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative turcotte
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
representative proud here recognized to
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you mr
 
00:59:13.599 --> 00:59:14.630 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you mr
chairman

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
so what we've seen is that the
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
governor's plan with fmli has already
 
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.109 align:start position:0%
governor's plan with fmli has already
worked

00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
worked
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
private insurance companies are looking
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
to offer this type of fmli
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
this makes the state plan with its new
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
cost to fund fmli for state employees
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to achieve the original goal
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
i'm also concerned that the tax breaks
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
for this program along with the single
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
company getting the contract will create
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
an effective monopoly preventing any
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
other company from entering the market
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um today i am
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
opposing hb 1165 the repeal of what sort
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
of can be called a granite state paid
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
family leave program
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
for the record i do not like this plan
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
that was passed as part of hb2 similar
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
to the way that i didn't like the
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
affordable care act in lieu of a public
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
option or universal healthcare
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
if i were to write a paid family leave
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
program it wouldn't look like this to
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
start it's not universal
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
an employee may only receive the
 
01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.589 align:start position:0%
an employee may only receive the
benefits

01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
of paid family leave if their employer
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
preemptively signs up for the plan
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
there's no opportunity for an employee
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
to sign up and receive benefits under a
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
larger pool if their employer believes
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
that pfml is wrong
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
sure there are tax credits available for
 
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
employers to help convince them to sign
 
01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:31.750 align:start position:0%
employers to help convince them to sign
up

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
but just like we saw in burwell the
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
hobby lobby an employer can often have
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
undue influence over an employee's
 
01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:37.910 align:start position:0%
undue influence over an employee's
choices

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
choices
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
and why did i use scare quotes earlier
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
when talking about benefits well because
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
an employee can only count on 60 of
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
their normal income to be taken care of
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
when they need the benefits in 2020
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
cnbc noted
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
that 65 of americans live paycheck to
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
paycheck and have no room for savings
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
and according to forbes today that
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
number is closer to seven and ten
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
an employee who decides to use this plan
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily sets themselves up for
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
failure because they have to forego
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
forty percent of their regular income to
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
take advantage of a program that they
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
pay into
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
this may be possible for an
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant making about
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
fifty five thousand dollars a year but
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
for a state liquor store employee who's
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
already unfortunately making twelve
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour they would essentially
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
be expected to live on seven dollars an
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
hour again under a program that they are
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
already paying into
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
this program is financially exclusive
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
for lower income granite staters who end
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
up paying the taxes but cannot afford to
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
use the program
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
this plan in my opinion was regressive
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
poorly conceived and poorly executed
 
01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.470 align:start position:0%
poorly conceived and poorly executed
however

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
the above mentioned reasons aren't why
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
some folks want to get rid of this
 
01:01:46.319 --> 01:01:47.270 align:start position:0%
some folks want to get rid of this
program

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
the concern is that it essentially will
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
cost money well yes it does cost money
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
when you have a policy priority you
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
outline it you make a case for it and if
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
you have the public support you pay for
 
01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.109 align:start position:0%
you have the public support you pay for
it

01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
president roosevelt heard the same
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
opposition to the new deal by people who
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
said well we like these things we just
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay for them and during
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
his 1936 re-election campaign fdr
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
described these arguments as just turn
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
these things over to us
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
we will do all of them we will do more
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
of them we will do them better and most
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
important of all the doing of them will
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
not cost anybody anything
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
i do not believe the answer here is
 
01:02:24.079 --> 01:02:25.029 align:start position:0%
i do not believe the answer here is
repeal

01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
just like i didn't think the answer to
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
the repeal the aca in 2017
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
even though i thought it was a weak
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
answer to the issue of health care in
 
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.870 align:start position:0%
answer to the issue of health care in
america

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
america
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
it is my position that paid family leave
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
ought to be provided to folks with as
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
few hurdles technocratic non-solutions
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
and barriers as possible not to scrap a
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
weak plan and go back to nothing
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
we should make this plan better not
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
throw it away
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
as such i will be voting against this
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
repeal and will continue to work for not
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
access to paid family leave
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
not opportunity for paid family leave
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
but paid family leave for everyone and
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
anyone who needs it thank you mr
 
01:03:01.039 --> 01:03:02.470 align:start position:0%
anyone who needs it thank you mr
chairman

01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
anyone else willing to speak
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte you recognize
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
first of all there's so many unknowns in
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.910 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
to begin with i learned a couple more
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
today um we don't even know
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
what the net negative effect is going to
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
be on
 
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.910 align:start position:0%
be on
tax

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
business taxes that are lost by
 
01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.230 align:start position:0%
business taxes that are lost by
employers

01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
who choose to opt into this plan
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
what the cost of
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayers is going to be on the
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
close to 11 000 state employees that
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
this plan will cover at no cost to the
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
employees we've heard very low ball
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
estimates on that we know for
 
01:04:01.119 --> 01:04:02.710 align:start position:0%
estimates on that we know for
or

01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
from previous attempts at this that the
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh the amount is going to be far far in
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
excess of what the bill had in it
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
back during the feltus i've mentioned
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
that before during the feltes plan we
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
had an individual who was a firefighter
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
who bought this type of insurance on his
 
01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:20.549 align:start position:0%
who bought this type of insurance on his
own

01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
that was had fewer benefits than this
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
and he was paying 60 a paycheck
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
so i believe when we get to
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
um the actual cost of this is going to
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
be so exorbitant that number one
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
private insurers uh private employers
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
are not going to be opting into this
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
plan it's just going to be too
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
too expensive for them so where are we
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
going to be we're going to have a plan
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
that exists with 11 000 state employees
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
who are being
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
who their
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
plans are being paid for by the
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and no private employer is
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
going to get into that
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
other public
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
workers throughout the state
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
are going to look at and say
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
the state employees are getting this
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
paid for why aren't we getting it paid
 
01:05:08.559 --> 01:05:09.349 align:start position:0%
paid for why aren't we getting it paid
for

01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
and they're going to demand from their
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
police unions firefighter unions
 
01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.029 align:start position:0%
police unions firefighter unions
whatever

01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
town employees are going to say we want
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
that and that additional cost is going
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
to end up on the backs of the
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so in effect what this is
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
going to end up being is a
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded fmli
 
01:05:32.319 --> 01:05:33.510 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded fmli
plan

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
when it is being touted in the press as
 
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
when it is being touted in the press as
a

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
private employer
 
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.710 align:start position:0%
private employer
option

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
we heard that
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
some i heard something new today
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner that people want
 
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
this well
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
who wants it i haven't heard of anybody
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
who wants it when asked the commissioner
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
really wasn't able to give any
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
anything but an
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
anecdotal we don't have any numbers on
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
that we don't know how many people want
 
01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:02.150 align:start position:0%
that we don't know how many people want
this

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
we've heard that the you know other
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
states do this and it's it's in the
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
preamble of this bill itself the part
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
that came out of hb2
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
that it's a it's a way to attract and
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
retain workers well if that's the case
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
also we've got to look at the states
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
that have these plans now states like
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
new jersey
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
new york
 
01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.109 align:start position:0%
new york
illinois

01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
illinois
 
01:06:27.119 --> 01:06:28.950 align:start position:0%
illinois
california

01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
california
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
those are the states that are for fmli
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
i i would
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
beg to differ that people are flocking
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
to those states in order to
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
become eligible from fmli in fact if if
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
you look at it those states are the
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
those with the highest net negative
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
migrations because they're fleeing those
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
states because of the high taxes and the
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
extent extensive social programs that
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
i'm going to stop there i could go on
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
for a very long time going through this
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
part in hb2 and all the
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
inadequacies that are in there and why
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
this plan is is not something we need
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire but i will leave
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
it at that i am in favor of the otopass
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else like to speak
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
on the motion on the floor
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
so i've been doing this long enough to
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
realize that
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
there's going to be 10 votes one way and
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
10 votes the other
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
and it's going to fall on me
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
to make the tying vote
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
and to say my phone was ringing off the
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
hook yesterday is an understatement as
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
so i will give you my statement
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
i don't like
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
putting legislation in budget bills
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's gotten out of control over the last
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
couple years and it's not right
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be this shouldn't have been in
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
i'm an insurance agent everyone knows
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
i've been doing that all my life
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
i think insurance
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
for better for worse
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
does it better than government when it
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
comes to anything
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
workers compensation
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
with a few problems seems to work all
 
01:08:12.319 --> 01:08:13.670 align:start position:0%
with a few problems seems to work all
right

01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
employment securities with a few bumps
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the road at times seems to work all
 
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.910 align:start position:0%
in the road at times seems to work all
right

01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
i would rather see government or private
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
business do this rather than government
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
as a republican
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
i like the incentive
 
01:08:29.679 --> 01:08:30.709 align:start position:0%
i like the incentive
to

01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
allow businesses to
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
offer this because i think every
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
business should offer some type of
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
disability medical however you want to
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
call it
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
giving them a discount off their
 
01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.510 align:start position:0%
giving them a discount off their
bet

01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
is also something that's
 
01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.349 align:start position:0%
is also something that's
advantageous

01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
advantageous
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
but how much
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
as a legislator i don't like to vote for
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
things when i don't know how much it's
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
going to cost
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
now finally i will applaud the governor
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
for coming up with an idea that was good
 
01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.430 align:start position:0%
for coming up with an idea that was good
enough

01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
that the private sector seems to want to
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
jump on it
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
so while that babe may not be the desire
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
to have it through a private
 
01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:19.030 align:start position:0%
to have it through a private
company

01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's the better way and the
 
01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.749 align:start position:0%
i think it's the better way and the
governor

01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
rung the bell
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
to allow that to happen
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
i have
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
again i am biased here but i have
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
tremendous faith in the insurance
 
01:09:31.759 --> 01:09:33.430 align:start position:0%
tremendous faith in the insurance
department

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
that they will come up with something
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
that um will be at least palatable to
 
01:09:38.719 --> 01:09:39.829 align:start position:0%
that um will be at least palatable to
some

01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
no one's going to get everything they
 
01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.149 align:start position:0%
no one's going to get everything they
want

01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
i will be supporting the um
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
the motion i had to pass
 
01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
frustrates me that we couldn't do
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
something better
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
but you know it's not all up to this
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
committee and we can't solve every
 
01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.350 align:start position:0%
committee and we can't solve every
problem

01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%

01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
that five of us were involved with
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.709 align:start position:0%
we saw as not um
beneficial

01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
beneficial
 
01:13:12.719 --> 01:13:14.870 align:start position:0%
beneficial
um

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
we think that the the end product is uh
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
fairly good we we did not
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
make this apply to private employers as
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
as most you well know on this committee
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
our job we feel is not to get in in
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
between the employer and the employee
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
whenever possible
 
01:13:36.239 --> 01:13:37.189 align:start position:0%
whenever possible
um

01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
what this would
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
do is apply to any public employer or
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
any private employer that receives any
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
kind of public funding or
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
grants or anything like that it would
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
also apply to
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
post-secondary educational
 
01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.870 align:start position:0%
post-secondary educational
institutions

01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
other than that i think
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
everybody has seen the amendment
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
and i ask that you do support the
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.030 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
this spills one of the more dangerous
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
bills that we've
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
dealt with um it's dangerous both on an
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
economic level and a medical level
 
01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.990 align:start position:0%
economic level and a medical level
economically

01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
economically
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
it puts at risk all of the medicare and
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
medicaid funding that goes to our
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals nursing homes
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
and other entities
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
and losing all of that funding
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
is a gigantic economic risk for the
 
01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:46.950 align:start position:0%
is a gigantic economic risk for the
state

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.950 align:start position:0%
state
um

01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
for that reason alone we shouldn't be
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
but in addition it's a medical
 
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.350 align:start position:0%
but in addition it's a medical
risk

01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
risk
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
what this basically says is that anyone
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
who doesn't feel like getting vaccinated
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
against any
 
01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.709 align:start position:0%
against any
disease

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
disease
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
can simply say i don't want to
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
and they then
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
don't get vaccinated
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
and we will see
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
infectious disease rates go up
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
here comes polio
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
here comes smallpox
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
here comes all the various diseases
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
measles this is not a covet bill
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
this is a bill against
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
all vaccines if you just don't want to
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
hugely dangerous
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
we should not do it i will be voting no
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
on ought to pass
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative seaworth
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
i want to respond to that because
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
everyone on the committee has been
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
receiving letters
 
01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.390 align:start position:0%
receiving letters
making

01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
the kinds of points that we just heard
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
i think the importance of this amendment
 
01:16:01.679 --> 01:16:02.470 align:start position:0%
i think the importance of this amendment
is

01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
it resolves those issues
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
first of all well and it
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
it does it both in the same way
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
so if you read carefully the amendment
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
it does provide for the ability
 
01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:18.390 align:start position:0%
it does provide for the ability
to

01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
ask for an exemption
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
based on the right of conscience the
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
right of conscience that's uh part of
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
our constitution and it says that the
 
01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.229 align:start position:0%
our constitution and it says that the
employer

01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:16:28.239 --> 01:16:29.350 align:start position:0%
employer
must

01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
must
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh grant that exemption
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
but then what what happens next
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
does that force these
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated employees to remain at a
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
business that
 
01:16:41.679 --> 01:16:42.870 align:start position:0%
business that
by

01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
federal mandates is required
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
not to allow them to do so no it does
 
01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.430 align:start position:0%
not to allow them to do so no it does
not

01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
because the the last sentence of section
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
two in the amendment says the employer
 
01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.430 align:start position:0%
two in the amendment says the employer
may

01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
then work with the employment employee
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
to see if an agreement for reasonable
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
accommodation can be reached
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
if such an agreement can't be reached
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
or if reaching such an agreement is
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
expensive for example losing all your
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
medicare money
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
then the employer is under no obligation
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
to accommodate that employee
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
the employee can be dismissed problem
 
01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:21.669 align:start position:0%
the employee can be dismissed problem
solved

01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
solved
 
01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:24.390 align:start position:0%
solved
similarly

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
under the current current
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances if there's an impasse if
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
an employer says
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
you know in order to remain employed
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
here you have to get this vaccine be it
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
covet or something else and an employee
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
says you know what no i i don't i
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
believe in
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
you know holistic medicine and only
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
taking things that are natural and i i
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
simply cannot take that vaccine
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
nobody can force that person to take the
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine you can fire them under under
 
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
the current situation
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
they will still remain on facts and
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and likewise once this bill
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
applies the employers may work with the
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
employee to find a situation where
 
01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:12.870 align:start position:0%
employee to find a situation where
they're

01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
removed from facing the public or
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
removed from dealing with medically
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
sensitive patients or
 
01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:21.830 align:start position:0%
sensitive patients or
with

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
medically sensitive fellow employees
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
or not they can say you know what the
 
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
nature of our business is that we can't
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
accommodate your request we've taken
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
your request
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
and we recognize that your right of
 
01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.990 align:start position:0%
and we recognize that your right of
conscience

01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
allows you
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
to be exempted but we cannot accommodate
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
you as employee
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's what's in this amendment that's
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
why i think this amendment is an
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
important change to the bill and it's an
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that addresses
 
01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.070 align:start position:0%
amendment that addresses
uh

01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
by and large
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we've received via
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
email in the last
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
few days or the last week so for that
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
reason i urge you
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
to support this amendment
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you

01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i have two
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
concerns uh one being that
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
litigation that could ensue you know
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
because the employer the employee isn't
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
happy with the decision of the employer
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
and the other is
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
if this doesn't really do anything and
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
the employer is still free to terminate
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
well i got everyone wants the answer
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
you're all welcome to answer the first
 
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
one i saw uh was turcotte then proud
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
then seaworth
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative cahill for the point
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
question i'll give you a prime example
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
how this
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
my company
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
that i work for became a
 
01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.149 align:start position:0%
that i work for became a
became

01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
became
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
put under the federal contractor mandate
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
okay back last fall
 
01:20:06.239 --> 01:20:07.189 align:start position:0%
okay back last fall
now

01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
want to force be forced to fire
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
20 percent of their pilot workforce
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't afford uh the
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
pilot workforce who had at first been
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
essential employees were now being
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
threatened with termination under the
 
01:20:28.159 --> 01:20:29.270 align:start position:0%
threatened with termination under the
vaccine

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
so what the company did
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
is they put out a statement to all of us
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
and they said
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
apply for the medical or the religious
 
01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.990 align:start position:0%
apply for the medical or the religious
exemption

01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:40.790 align:start position:0%
exemption
well

01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
if some of us being honest cannot
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
request an exemption of either those two
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
what do we do
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
the net effect of a religious exemption
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
and a right of conscience exemption is
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
the exact same
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
our company
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
was pushing
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
our pilots to apply for religious
 
01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.510 align:start position:0%
our pilots to apply for religious
exemptions

01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
and saying don't worry we'll get it
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
because our company even though they
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
were under the threat of losing federal
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
money didn't want to lose their
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
essential employees
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
over a vaccine
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
issue so this
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
my company might not apply to this
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
within new hampshire you know i haven't
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
thought that through but that's an
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
example of
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
why the right of conscience has been
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
added in there
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
the right of conscience the net effect
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
of a right of conscience
 
01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.110 align:start position:0%
of a right of conscience
or

01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
a religious exemption in my mind
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
is the same
 
01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.830 align:start position:0%
is the same
problem

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:21:48.159 --> 01:21:48.950 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
so

01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative covered many points but
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this bill does
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
and that what it is new what it changes
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
as i see it is
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
is it gets companies and their associate
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
hr departments
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
out of the business as we have seen some
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
charge into this business
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
of trying to test
 
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
an employee's
 
01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.189 align:start position:0%
an employee's
religiousness

01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
religiousness
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
how religious they are whether their
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
claim is valid
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
whether their religion
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
they're following the tenets of an
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
organized religion
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
and all the places that go
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
which for some companies has turned on
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
to almost a full-on inquisition and down
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
a road that
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
like people
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
the idea of people crying into
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
another person's private religious
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
beliefs especially in a regulated
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
environment like reasonable
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
accommodations and everything else
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
and that this bill short circuits that
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
aspect of it
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
the exemption shall be granted there's
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
no are you religious enough test
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
no judging of that by the
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
the company's hr department which i feel
 
01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:53.750 align:start position:0%
the company's hr department which i feel
they're

01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
in a bad position to do that
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
and it goes straight to
 
01:22:57.199 --> 01:22:58.870 align:start position:0%
and it goes straight to
okay

01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
what can we do
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure the fact that you have an
 
01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:05.030 align:start position:0%
to make sure the fact that you have an
exemption

01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you're a risk to
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
customers or other employees or
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
everywhere else and find an
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
accommodation that works
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
and skips that first part that has been
 
01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:16.790 align:start position:0%
and skips that first part that has been
problematic

01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
what was just said the other thing i'll
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
respond to in terms of effect one of the
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
things we heard from deputy commissioner
 
01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.669 align:start position:0%
things we heard from deputy commissioner
lavers

01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
lavers
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh he was asked about
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
how many
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
workers were dismissed due to
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
refusal to take the cover 19 vaccine
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
and how many of those were eligible for
 
01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.149 align:start position:0%
and how many of those were eligible for
unemployment

01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
and it was about 20 percent i think it
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
was a number
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
or it was a 20
 
01:23:58.639 --> 01:24:00.629 align:start position:0%
or it was a 20
uh

01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
15 to 20 individuals
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
in about 80 percent if i remember the
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
numbers and i'm probably not so
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
take that
 
01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.790 align:start position:0%
take that
[Music]

01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
a reason
 
01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:25.590 align:start position:0%
a reason
for

01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment being
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
granted to the dismissed individual was
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
that they had submitted and been awarded
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
an exemption to the vaccination
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
this goes in terms of the effect i think
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
that that would be a real effect and
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's an effect for that situation that
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte described
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
where you have an individual
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
but not a a reason that's religious
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
simply will not
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
take that vaccination
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
it it treats them on an equal footage to
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
those that have a religious exemption
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
that right now through the processes we
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
go for go through are recognized and
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
makes them equally eligible for
 
01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:20.870 align:start position:0%
makes them equally eligible for
unemployment

01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
on both cases so
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
like my fellow representatives i see
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
president of mandal
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i agree with
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
the statement that representative
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
sullivan made at the beginning and i
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
think that's the most important aspect
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
that we gotten to lose even as we
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
thought think and talk about covet i
 
01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
would only add this though that i was
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
listening carefully to representative
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
prout and he
 
01:25:59.679 --> 01:26:00.709 align:start position:0%
prout and he
did

01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
indicate that a benefit as he sought of
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would be to get
 
01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:06.550 align:start position:0%
this bill would be to get
companies

01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
out of the business of being involved in
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
religious tests and their
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
assessments and so forth and as that may
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
be true one unfortunate aspect is that
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
it would get the government more into
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
the business of businesses in ways that
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
might be
 
01:26:25.199 --> 01:26:32.229 align:start position:0%
might be
sub-optimal

01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to be the chairman of a
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
committee that was responsible for
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
a bill coming out of the house that
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
would take away 200 million dollars
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
worth of funding for medicare and
 
01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.189 align:start position:0%
worth of funding for medicare and
medicaid

01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
um so i dug into this thing like i
 
01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
probably never dug into a bill before
 
01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.750 align:start position:0%
probably never dug into a bill before
and

01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i i rep i i
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
congratulated representative turcotte
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
for threading the needle the way he did
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
if you really look at the amendment
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
the the amendment supports not getting
 
01:27:07.679 --> 01:27:09.270 align:start position:0%
the the amendment supports not getting
involved

01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily between
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
the hospitals or anyone receiving that
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
and their contracts
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
with the federal government because it
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
says you will
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
you will accept the
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.790 align:start position:0%
 
exemption

01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
but you may or may not
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
choose to
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
keep them on based on that
 
01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:36.310 align:start position:0%
keep them on based on that
now

01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative cahill asks questions so
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
why bother well it helps in a number of
 
01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.590 align:start position:0%
why bother well it helps in a number of
reasons

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
can make a decision
 
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
a good employee
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
very valuable we don't want to lose
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
employees we can put them somewhere else
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
or do something else that may not
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
violate our contracts
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
or we will not
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
they sell the same position they were in
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
before if they want to fire someone or
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
not but it also gives them a a mechanism
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
that they may
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
be able to make some accommodations
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
is then fired because the
 
01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:14.390 align:start position:0%
is then fired because the
the

01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
employer feels that there it is a
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
violation between their contract
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh with medicare and medicaid they can
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
go to unemployment securities
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
for benefits unemployment securities
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
will look at that and say
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not the employer
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
was consistent or arbitrary
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
so they gave john brian and i
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
the exemption and put it somewhere else
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
but not let in in
 
01:28:42.719 --> 01:28:44.070 align:start position:0%
but not let in in
lino

01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
lino
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
well no that's not consistent the
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
department will then make that decision
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not they will get the
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
benefits or not which is what they have
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
been doing now which is why only a
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of them have received
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
the benefits
 
01:28:57.199 --> 01:29:00.310 align:start position:0%
the benefits
so

01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.189 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
i respectfully disagree with
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan i don't think
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
any of us that are going to support this
 
01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.750 align:start position:0%
any of us that are going to support this
today

01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
are foolish enough to think that we're
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
going to take away 200 million dollars
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
worth of funds
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
to hospitals
 
01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:17.750 align:start position:0%
to hospitals
and

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
nursing homes to put them all out of
 
01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.990 align:start position:0%
nursing homes to put them all out of
business

01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
this is simply not the case now is it
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
narrowly written and would a lawyer have
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
to look at it sure
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:35.669 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
we did our best to keep this
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
ourselves and this bill out of the
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
relationship between
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
the medical institution and where they
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
get their funds
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
now maybe it's not as clear to some
 
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
because it took trust me it took me a
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
little while to figure it out too
 
01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.590 align:start position:0%
little while to figure it out too
but

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
i i can't speak for my fellow colleagues
 
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
will not vote for a bill that takes away
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
that kind of funds and i
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
seeing no other hands
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
the motion for the amendment has been
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%

the amendment is the new bill so i think
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%

01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
the only last comment i'd like to make
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
is um initially i had asked the hospital
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
association to provide me with an
 
01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.390 align:start position:0%

amendment
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%

it was not necessary but that amendment
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman um the
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
amendment before you were places in its
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
entirety uh original bill 1337 although
 
01:33:34.239 --> 01:33:35.030 align:start position:0%
entirety uh original bill 1337 although
the

01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
the the framework of the bill remains uh
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
as it was what i'm going to do is go
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
over some of the changes just so
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
we had a
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
the maximum
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
number of weeks
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
for unemployment had been
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
reduced to 20.
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
under the new bill
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
it still has the same effect and that is
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
when the unemployment rate is high the
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
number of weeks of unemployment
 
01:34:16.709 --> 01:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
compensation is high
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
when the unemployment unemployment rate
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
is low
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
those number of weeks are reduced
 
01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:24.070 align:start position:0%
those number of weeks are reduced
so

01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
under the new bill or under the
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
amendment i should say
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
it goes from 26 weeks maximum
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
down to
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
12. 16. the original bill we put forward
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
was 12 weeks
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
we had lots of input from the business
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
associations and different groups and i
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
i want to thank upfront deputy
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner lavers he's been very very
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
helpful with supplying data and some and
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
different things on this
 
01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:53.990 align:start position:0%
different things on this
um

01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
he um
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
he volunteered some information a couple
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
weeks ago on uh
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
claims and the length of unemployment
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
going back in the 2018-2019 version and
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
that was very helpful and after looking
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
believe that the 16 weeks was a a better
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
number on the lower end of the scale and
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
that sixteen weeks is any time
 
01:35:19.109 --> 01:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate is below three
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
we did receive input from the
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
contractors association on the seasonal
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh seasonal workers
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh that that was also a one of the
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
reasons that we changed at the bottom
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
from 12 weeks to 16. i know it's not
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
quite what they were looking for
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
but uh in all honesty any time that the
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate is below 3
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
anybody who's going to be employed for
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
four or five months over the winter
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
months in this especially in this type
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
of environment there's obviously
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
jobs out there we all hear the job
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
offerings on the radio we see them
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
online we see them as we drive down the
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
road so although that wasn't quite what
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
they were looking for it is a four week
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
improvement the other thing i did on
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
that is originally we pegged the
 
01:36:14.639 --> 01:36:15.910 align:start position:0%
that is originally we pegged the
benchmark

01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
benchmark
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
on the third quarter of each year
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
in this in the amendment i've changed it
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
to the fourth quarter and the reason for
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
that was also for this seasonal
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
although it's probably not going to make
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
a huge difference
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate will necessarily
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
be a little bit higher in those months
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the very first uh actually line five
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
um we had had uh some conversations and
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
some uh concerns about
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know what would happen again in in
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
the case of a covert nine situation 19
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
economic

01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
economic
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
downturn we had in 2008 time frame
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner lavers laver said
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
that he didn't really feel that was a
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
huge issue only because the feds in both
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
cases have stepped in
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
at times when uh
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate has gone very you
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
know necessarily high
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
even though he
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
he i believe he feels comfortable with
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
that i actually added in in line five a
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh three words not withstanding
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
rsa445 and what that does
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
is it puts this language
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
or it attaches to this language a state
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
of emergency so if we were ever in a
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
declared state of emergency again
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh the the governor would have the
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
ability to alter
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh this uh
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
this pair uh
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
the new uh
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
indexing of the unemployment
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh the very last thing i changed in it
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh was the effective day originally it
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
was 60. i changed it to 120 and that was
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
simply to give all parties involved
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
employers employees
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
the department and
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
everybody else the ability to
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know get to get their ducks in a row
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
before it actually became effective
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i think i have covered everything on
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
that thank you mr chairman
 
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:38:25.679 --> 01:38:28.950 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
this amendment i believe
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
makes the original bill um a little less
 
01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:35.510 align:start position:0%
makes the original bill um a little less
bad

01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
bad
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
um i will therefore support the
 
01:38:37.199 --> 01:38:38.229 align:start position:0%
um i will therefore support the
amendment

01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:38:38.239 --> 01:38:39.590 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the problem with this is
 
01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:42.790 align:start position:0%
the uh the problem with this is
that

01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
um the unemployment rate certainly does
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
affect the ability of people to find
 
01:38:48.239 --> 01:38:49.510 align:start position:0%
affect the ability of people to find
employment

01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
but it's not the only thing that if that
 
01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.030 align:start position:0%
but it's not the only thing that if that
affects

01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
affects
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
people's ability to find employment
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
there are some people when they lose a
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
job because of family circumstances
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
because of physical frailty
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
because of age
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
or other factors they may find that they
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
have a difficult time
 
01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.830 align:start position:0%
have a difficult time
finding

01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
finding
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
replacement employment
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
therefore access to the full 26 weeks
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
is important
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony that
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
it is rare for people to use the full 26
 
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.189 align:start position:0%
it is rare for people to use the full 26
weeks

01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
most people because they're required to
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
look for work are able to find it
 
01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
the requirement to seek work
 
01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.390 align:start position:0%
the requirement to seek work
works

01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
so essentially
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is unnecessary because we
 
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
already have a population that gets back
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
to work when they lose their job
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
but we also have an employment security
 
01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.550 align:start position:0%
but we also have an employment security
system

01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
that provides for the people who can't
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
find work for various reasons
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
and no matter what the reason is they
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
can access those 26 weeks
 
01:39:59.119 --> 01:40:00.149 align:start position:0%
can access those 26 weeks
if

01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
there are circumstances that make it
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
impossible for them to find work sooner
 
01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.189 align:start position:0%
impossible for them to find work sooner
so

01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
i i don't like the amendment but i like
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
it better than the original bill
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
therefore i will support the amendment i
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
will not support the ought to pass thank
 
01:40:15.679 --> 01:40:21.990 align:start position:0%
will not support the ought to pass thank
you

01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.109 --> 01:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
was gonna ask a question buddy do you
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
have another comment represent
 
01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:25.910 align:start position:0%
have another comment represent
yes

01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
in response to uh
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
representatives uh points
 
01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:32.390 align:start position:0%
representatives uh points
uh

01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
again the
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
the data that was provided was very
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
informative um
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
i'll just kind of read it off from what
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
i have
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
those and again this is from 2018 2019
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
which very similar situation i guess to
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
where we are now
 
01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:48.830 align:start position:0%
where we are now
but

01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh pretty much 50 percent of people
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
used unemployment
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
for less than 10 weeks that's an
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
astounding number
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
and up to between the bracket that i was
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
given between 15 and 19 a full 75
 
01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:04.870 align:start position:0%
given between 15 and 19 a full 75
percent

01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
use between 15 and 19 weeks or less 75
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
then there's a spattering
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
of percentages very very low single
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
digits between 20 21 22 23 24 25 until
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
you get to 26 and at 26
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
there's a 16
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
number now
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
we can all
 
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
make assumptions as to what how that 16
 
01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:32.050 align:start position:0%
percent is made up of
 
01:41:32.050 --> 01:41:35.350 align:start position:0%
percent is made up of
[Music]

01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
minority of the
 
01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:50.550 align:start position:0%
minority of the
uh

01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
people affected by this i believe the 16
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
at the full 20 26 weeks there may be
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
some of those in that that are there for
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
other reasons than simply they can't
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
find work
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the percentage is
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
but again we shouldn't be writing laws
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
for that i agree that we have a great
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
system in new hampshire already the
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner lavers has made that
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
statement i'm totally in agreement with
 
01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:17.830 align:start position:0%
statement i'm totally in agreement with
them

01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
the bottom line on this
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
is by going to an indexing rate
 
01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
not only does it incentivize people to
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
get back to work as soon as possible
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
even though our new hampshire people do
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
a pretty darn good job already but the
 
01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:32.149 align:start position:0%
a pretty darn good job already but the
other

01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing and this has been found
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
in every other state it's tried again i
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
think i talked about florida as the
 
01:42:39.199 --> 01:42:40.870 align:start position:0%
think i talked about florida as the
the

01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
gold star state who
 
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
put this indexing into their laws but
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
that is that the uninsurance rate
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance rates that the
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
businesses pay will also go down it's
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
going to go down immediately no it'll
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
probably take a time for for everything
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
to kind of
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
work its way in but uh certainly
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
uninsurance employment rates aren't
 
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
going to go up for businesses so again i
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
i would hope everybody support this
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
we have we take a question
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
do you know how many years this has been
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
a place in massachusetts and if whether
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
or not they have made any changes uh to
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
their original because of maybe
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:22.229 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
no

01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%

seconded by representative avaloni
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
they were recognized to speak to your
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
motion thank you mr chairman uh
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
similar to the last bill we talked about
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
this one uh
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment replaces the entire bill
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
so we've had i think had the discussion
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
that we need to on that thank you
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
i would simply like to uh say that
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
i believe we do make legislation for the
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
the minority for the 16 percent that
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
take the full 26 weeks that's how we
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
take care of people it doesn't happen
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
often the majority of people don't use
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
the 26 weeks
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
not anywhere close to it
 
01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:40.149 align:start position:0%
not anywhere close to it
but

01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is definitely a case of
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
if it ain't broke don't fix it
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
so uh i say leave it alone we've got a
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:54.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah no it's not that i don't know your
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
name i just if you were going to speak a
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
second time i'd i have an individual
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
willing to speak the first time as well
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to do that if i could
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
represent you were recognized
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i believe uh
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan did a good job
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
speaking about the specific mechanical
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
issues associated with the bill
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
my issue is more philosophical
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to drastically slash the
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
social social safety net after a year of
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
complaints that unemployment makes it so
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to work anymore
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
in june of 2021 the argument was simple
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
a 300 a week unemployment benefit at a
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
time when you're lucky to only have that
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
as your rent was so lucrative and
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
succulent that people chose to stay home
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
instead of going to these wonderful
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
well-paying jobs that we had open
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
that belief was tested in july of 2021
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
when the video administration ended the
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
federal unemployment enhancement this
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
was beautiful because finally we would
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
get everybody back to work the following
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
jobs report was atrocious because as it
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
turned out randomly slashing
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits did not fix all
 
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
our problems
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
reading from cnbc
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
ending federal unemployment benefits had
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
little impact on jobs and fueled two
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
billion dollar spending cut study fines
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
if that's not your taste the economic
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
policy institute
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
cutting unemployment insurance benefits
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
did not boost job growth the july
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment and unemployment data
 
01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:22.719 align:start position:0%
released friday by the bureau of labor
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
statistics showed that strong job growth
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
reported earlier this month in the
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
national jobs data was widespread
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the country and notably the
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
states that chose not to cut pandemic
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
employment insurance benefits
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
had

01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
i'm reading that wrong hold on
 
01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:44.070 align:start position:0%
i'm reading that wrong hold on
um

01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
reading from
 
01:47:49.109 --> 01:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
this is another epi piece states that
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
cut employment benefits saw limited
 
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
impact on job growth states that ended
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
enhanced federal unemployment benefits
 
01:47:57.910 --> 01:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
early have so far seen about the same
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
job growth as states that continued
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
offering the pandemic related extra aid
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
according to a wall street journal
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
analysis of the economists
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
if the question is is ui the key thing
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
that's holding us back the labor market
 
01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
recovery the answer is no definitely not
 
01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:15.679 align:start position:0%
based on the available data said peter
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
ganon a university of chicago economist
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
referring to unemployment insurance
 
01:48:23.109 --> 01:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
how about business insider the research
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
keeps coming out about how governors
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
hurt their states when they cut off
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
employment benefits early
 
01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
reading from the article however there's
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
one thing that increasingly hasn't
 
01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:33.350 align:start position:0%
one thing that increasingly hasn't
happened

01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
research has continually found that
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
cutting off the benefits early had
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
little difference on job growth in
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
employment the latest analysis comes
 
01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
from the wall street journal which found
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
that there were roughly similar job
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
growth in states that did and did not
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
opt out of benefits that aligns with
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
other early research on the impact of
 
01:48:51.199 --> 01:48:52.310 align:start position:0%
other early research on the impact of
benefits

01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
cnbc reports that analysis from payroll
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
firms home base and ukg found both that
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
employment didn't go up in states that
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
were cutting off benefits
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
in fact the home base analysis found
 
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
that employment declined in states
 
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
opting out of the federal benefits while
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
it went up in states that chose to
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
retain benefits in june indeed's hiring
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
lab found that the job searches in
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
states ending benefits were below
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
april's baseline
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
so here we are in new hampshire looking
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
at the same philosophical idea that the
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
federal government did in 2021 about to
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
do the same thing and expecting
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
different results
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
if you want to increase workforce
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
participation you raise the minimum wage
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
if you want to increase workforce
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
participation you stop attacking the
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
trade union movement if you want to
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
increase workforce participation you
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
create more time protections for service
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
employees you crack down on wage theft
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
all of these things will increase
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
workforce participation but blaming an
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
already tattered social safety net for
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
doing the good job that it was designed
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
to do is not a way to fill the vacant
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
jobs we have open i enthusiastically
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
oppose the otp motion for this bill and
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
hope the committee overturns it so a
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
different motion can be made thank you
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
mr chairman welcome representative
 
01:50:11.119 --> 01:50:12.149 align:start position:0%
mr chairman welcome representative
cahill

01:50:12.149 --> 01:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
cahill
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i'm going to be
 
01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:15.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i'm going to be
brief

01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
brief
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i'll just quote what i believe mr
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
labors told us when we originally
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
discussed the bill that our weekly
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
benefit amount is enough incentive to
 
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh just addressing
 
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of points that i made let's
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
start with the the 16 percent um that
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
used utilized in uh 2018 and 2019 the
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
full 26
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
weeks the point when i made that i was
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
trying to be subtle about it but at it
 
01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:46.310 align:start position:0%
trying to be subtle about it but at it
from

01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
19 weeks to 25 weeks
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
there's almost zero utilization in other
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
words almost nobody uses that those
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
number of weeks
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
yet when you get to 26
 
01:50:57.199 --> 01:50:58.149 align:start position:0%
yet when you get to 26
weeks

01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden that number jumps to 16
 
01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.189 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden that number jumps to 16
percent

01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
i have my thoughts on why that happens
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
some may have other reasons uh the 300 a
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
month let's let's talk about that that's
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
a good point to bring up last spring
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh the governor
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
when asked
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
decided he was going to retain and keep
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
the 300 dollar a week
 
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
money coming from
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
he quickly reversed that less than a
 
01:51:30.629 --> 01:51:30.639 align:start position:0%
couple weeks later and the reason he
 
01:51:30.639 --> 01:51:31.430 align:start position:0%
couple weeks later and the reason he
he

01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
took that back is because businesses
 
01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
complained to him said we need to get
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
our workers back
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
did a u-turn on his his thoughts on that
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
so yes in fact the three hundred dollars
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
a week twelve hundred dollars a month
 
01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.229 align:start position:0%
a week twelve hundred dollars a month
was

01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
enough on top of all the other benefits
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
that were being given
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
to keep people out of the workforce and
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
the businesses made that point crystal
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
clear to the governor and he reversed
 
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
his uh
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
his original
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative would you take a question
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
i will not
 
01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:09.830 align:start position:0%
i will not
okay

01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
um then i will just make a comment um i
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
believe i laid out pretty clearly that
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
slashing the 300 week benefit did not
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
have a discernible impact on getting
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
people back to work and filling jobs
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
um just because
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
businesses thought that it would and
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
then it didn't that i don't think that's
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rudy then
 
01:52:38.239 --> 01:52:39.510 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rudy then
mandeville

01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
mandeville
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:52:41.199 --> 01:52:42.310 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic
 
01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
i was asked to help some people find a
 
01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:47.910 align:start position:0%
i was asked to help some people find a
job

01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
most of them elderly people who had been
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
in a job for a long time
 
01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:52.950 align:start position:0%
in a job for a long time
um

01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
for one reason or another lost a job
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
plant closing or whatever
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
so the church asked me to get involved
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
with some of these people writing
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
resumes for them
 
01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
sending out letters helping them find a
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
job trying to teach them new skills
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
basic skills
 
01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:11.109 align:start position:0%
basic skills
um

01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
especially people in the end of their
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
work working lives
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
if they lose their job
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
it's pretty hard to retrain and find
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
another job
 
01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
i had maybe eight or ten people that
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
went over to 26 weeks he's a good
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
working people
 
01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
fairly intelligent
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
but just needed a different
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
different job classification they needed
 
01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:36.709 align:start position:0%
different job classification they needed
retraining

01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
retraining
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
26 weeks doesn't even always cut it so
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
and that was before the pandemic
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
now covert comes along and we have
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
businesses closing
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
you take a person working at one job for
 
01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's all he knows it's all she knows
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
they lose their job
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
what happens to them
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
they know nothing else it takes them a
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
while to find somewhere to go
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:07.109 --> 01:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
i

01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
listened to
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte's uh statistics
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
and i was interested in them too and as
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
he acknowledges that there's some degree
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
of speculation
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the coin i imagine
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
relative to the 16
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
versus the lesser
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh percentage numbers for
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
the periods of time below 26 weeks
 
01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
to me it signifies as representative
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
broody is just implicitly referred to
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
that there are circumstances that are
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
unique to particular people which i
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
think our current system has been
 
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
intended to and does
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
address by way of
 
01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:50.390 align:start position:0%
address by way of
discouraging

01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
discouraging
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
staying out of the workforce but
 
01:54:56.070 --> 01:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
providing for those with particular
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
needs and the question is
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
what the particularities are
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
the fact of looking at
 
01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
at 26 weeks and comparing it to 19 or 17
 
01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
actually just
 
01:55:11.199 --> 01:55:12.470 align:start position:0%
actually just
heightens

01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
heightens
 
01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:14.470 align:start position:0%
heightens
the

01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:16.310 align:start position:0%
the
context

01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
for the 26 weeks as it might bear on
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
matters of particular concern either to
 
01:55:26.070 --> 01:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
the difficulties of retraining
 
01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
the circumstances of a particular
 
01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:30.950 align:start position:0%
the circumstances of a particular
person's

01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
person's
 
01:55:34.229 --> 01:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
skills location
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
experience etc and it seems to me the
 
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
the idea of indexing
 
01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
this to unemployment
 
01:55:42.639 --> 01:55:43.830 align:start position:0%
this to unemployment
is

01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:55:46.229 --> 01:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
takes little if anything into account
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the peculiarities of
 
01:55:52.229 --> 01:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
the length of time between
 
01:55:52.239 --> 01:55:54.870 align:start position:0%
the length of time between
um

01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
26 weeks and and a lesser amount of time
 
01:56:00.070 --> 01:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
so i i oppose this and by the way if it
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't seem presumptuous i would
 
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
say as
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
the youngest or newest member of the
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
group that i think it's incumbent upon
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
us in my opinion to approve of of uh
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
amendments that
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
even for bills we oppose we think
 
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
improves them and therefore i was
 
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
pleased to vote in favor of the
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
amendment but against the bill thank you
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
the uh a member of this committee serves
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
on the employment securities advisory
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
board i am currently that person before
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
i believe representative sullivan was uh
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
prior no representative goalie
 
01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative susan
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
and and uh they meet and they go over
 
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
these things and they make
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations um
 
01:56:48.790 --> 01:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
the advisory board was against three
 
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
bills that came in front of us this year
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
and we've killed those three
 
01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh they really didn't have a position on
 
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
this um on this
 
01:56:59.910 --> 01:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
but i did send all of you this report
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
and all these graphs and it's very
 
01:57:03.119 --> 01:57:05.270 align:start position:0%
and all these graphs and it's very
telling

01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
telling
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
the the two biggest areas where people
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
left new hampshire employment since the
 
01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.270 align:start position:0%
left new hampshire employment since the
pandemic

01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
are notably folks 60 to 64. which i
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
think we can all assume you know okay
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's time maybe we're going to take an
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
early retirement don't want to deal with
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
this re reassess life because of this
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
terrible tragedy that has uh been in
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
front of this country and the world
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
the one that was most notable was
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
individuals from 25 to 29
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
left the workforce
 
01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:35.669 align:start position:0%
left the workforce
why

01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
was it because of the benefits that were
 
01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:40.950 align:start position:0%
was it because of the benefits that were
given

01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
you know we can all make our own
 
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
assumptions as to what's going on
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
understand employment securities is paid
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
for by the employers
 
01:57:49.199 --> 01:57:49.990 align:start position:0%
for by the employers
okay

01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
and most employers
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
approve of it
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
um because
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know because they are there take
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know paying for it they it's a
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
combination of the right thing to do
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
it's a combination of uh it's better for
 
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
society i mean this is one of those real
 
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
social type things that employers pay
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
to help people get back up to get moving
 
01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
and and else
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of incumbent on us we want
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure we have done a lot of
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
things in this committee to make sure
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
people are getting back to work
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
any of you who served here years ago
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
recall that it used to be you took the
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
16 weeks off in the winter time for
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
seasonal you don't have to work you have
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
to look for a job
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
that we changed that now they do and
 
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
people are looking for jobs
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the winter months if they're an
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
operator they find work as a machinist
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
or something moving a a
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
forklift or whatever in a business they
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
find those things to do and that's
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
require requirement that we made in this
 
01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:50.149 align:start position:0%
require requirement that we made in this
state

01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:58:51.910 --> 01:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
and it's been actually
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
pretty good for some people i know
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
people have said yeah i found a better
 
01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
job working on this working in the
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
winter i found a job i liked better
 
01:59:00.239 --> 01:59:01.510 align:start position:0%
winter i found a job i liked better
so

01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
try to
 
01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
look about making the mouse trap better
 
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
one major issue
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
that came up in front of us years ago
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
had to do with workers compensation if
 
01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
you all remember this i spent a
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of time on this
 
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
we had a
 
01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
sentence in the law that was
 
01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
being misinterpreted that
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
hospitals or medical facilities could
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
charge whatever they wanted and it had
 
01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
to be paid by the insurance carriers we
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
got to change that around
 
01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
i was okay at the last minute
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
another republican
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
came in on the house floor
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
dan and carol dan uh
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
maguire came in
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
and put an amendment through
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
and put a big monkey wrench in the thing
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
i and i didn't like it because i was
 
01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:53.589 align:start position:0%
i and i didn't like it because i was
fearful

01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
fearful
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
that his change
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
was going to cause a
 
02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
train load of people to be going to the
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
department of labor and arguing it
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
and guess who was wrong
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
i was
 
02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
everyone figured it out
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
they made their own deals between the
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
medical and the workers comp
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
so the government didn't have to
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
but i was fearful i said no you guys are
 
02:00:21.669 --> 02:00:21.679 align:start position:0%
wrong you're taking all my hard work and
 
02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
all this committee's work and you're
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
doing this on the house floor and it's
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
going to be a catastrophe and i was
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
wrong and it's been probably one of the
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
better things and what's happened to our
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
workers comp rates in the last 10 years
 
02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
we've gone down
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
so yes sometimes we're fearful of this
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
i'll be the first one to tell you if
 
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
this doesn't work i'm going to
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
employment securities advisory board and
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
i'll come back to this legislature and
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
say no this isn't working here it
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't work in new hampshire we're
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
going to change it
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
it's worth seeing if this
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
makes the system better
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no other hands
 
02:00:59.109 --> 02:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate the
 
02:00:59.119 --> 02:01:00.390 align:start position:0%
appreciate the
honest

when i introduced house bill 1529 i

spoke of one instance where information
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
that was given to me by a couple
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
constituents turned out to be erroneous
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
in the second instance emotion got the
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
best of me not only five years ago but
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
when i read the information but in
 
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
testimony also i was mistaken
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
i apologize for any hurt or ill feelings
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
that i i have caused anyone here on the

live stream or anywhere for that matter
 
02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
by that testimony
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
as as uh house bill 1529 nobody's done a
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
more done more harm to well-intentioned
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
legislation than i have here
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
i asked the committee vote to find house
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
bill 1529 itl my hope here is that we

could find a a bipartisan consensus and
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%

periodically there were originally seven
 
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%

02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
i have not checked to see whether any of
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
those have come over i would expect
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
probably three to five pieces of
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
