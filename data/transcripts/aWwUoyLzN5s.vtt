present well I announced my presence at
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
the very beginning of the meeting so I
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
trust that that will be sufficient to
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
indicate my presence
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
we have a series of six public hearings

this morning I will be meeting the first
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
public Hearing in just a few minutes but
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
before I do that
 
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
I wanted to pass along a few reminders
 
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
to everyone
 
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
for everyone who is here in the
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
the state uh policy legislative policy
 
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
about mask wearing is that while you are
 
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
seated in your seat
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
it is permissible for you to remove your
 
00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:10.730 align:start position:0%
it is permissible for you to remove your
mask

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
mask
 
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
but if you leave your seat for any
 
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
reason you must affix your mask
 
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
I will be observing your behavior in
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
this regard
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
and I will report to the
 
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.790 align:start position:0%
and I will report to the
speaker

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
anyone who violates this policy
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
so please remember to
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
put your mask on when you leave your
 
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.930 align:start position:0%
put your mask on when you leave your
seat

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
seat
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's common courtesy
 
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.290 align:start position:0%
it's common courtesy
to

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
all our fellow legislators and to the
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
members of the House staff who are in
 
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
secondly because of the nature of this
 
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
hybrid meeting where some of us are here
 
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
and some of us are on Zoom
 
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
we need the people in the room here to
 
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
speak loudly and clearly
 
00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:03.419 align:start position:0%
when you're recognized to speak so that
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
the people watching at home on Zoom can
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
hear you
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have individual microphones for
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
every member so we have some
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
devices around the room to pick up sound
 
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
but they might not pick up
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
any spoken words unless those words are
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
articulated loudly and clearly
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
so keep that in mind when you raise your
 
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:31.220 align:start position:0%
hand to ask a question
 
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.110 align:start position:0%
hand to ask a question
[Music]

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
we will in addition
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
to be observing the guidelines that we
 
00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
talked about at our first orientation
 
00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.029 align:start position:0%
talked about at our first orientation
meeting

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
we've asked everyone who plans to
 
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
testify this morning to submit written
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
testimony on their bills
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
we are going to allocate time for
 
00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:58.860 align:start position:0%
speaking at the public hearing
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
based on the people who have registered
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
a desire to testify
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
so if we have in an hour's time 50
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
people who want to testify then each
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
person is going to get
 
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
very little time to testify
 
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
if we have only two people signed up to
 
00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:19.970 align:start position:0%
if we have only two people signed up to
testify

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
as is apparently the case on HB 80 the
 
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
first bill we will hear this morning
 
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
then time time limits will be
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
set aside
 
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:35.459 align:start position:0%
for the time being since they won't be
 
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
necessary to allow us to conduct the
 
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.329 align:start position:0%
necessary to allow us to conduct the
business

00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
we do ask that when you testify that you
 
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.790 align:start position:0%
we do ask that when you testify that you
make

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
the points you want to make
 
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
highlight your most important points and
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
do not repeat points that have been made
 
00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
by other
 
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.190 align:start position:0%
by other
presenters

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
Depending on time limits we will
 
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
restrict the questions by members to two
 
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.630 align:start position:0%
restrict the questions by members to two
questions

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:19.019 align:start position:0%
before I allow
 
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
a member to ask another question in
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
excess of the two
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh I will make sure that all other
 
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
members have asked any questions that
 
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
we also remind members not to make
 
00:10:35.459 --> 00:10:36.769 align:start position:0%
we also remind members not to make
statements

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
statements
 
00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:38.269 align:start position:0%
statements
uh

00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:40.550 align:start position:0%
uh
that

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:43.019 align:start position:0%
are not germane
 
00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
to the question you're about to ask
 
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
and I also remember remind members that
 
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%
we're not here to engage in a debate
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
with the people who are presenting we
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
are here to hear their testimony
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
and gather information from those
 
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.430 align:start position:0%
and gather information from those
individuals

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
foreign and with those guidelines in
 
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.170 align:start position:0%
foreign and with those guidelines in
mind

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
even though I
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
do not have a gavel yet
 
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
I will
 
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
knock on the table to indicate that
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
we're opening the public hearing on HB
 
00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:24.110 align:start position:0%
we're opening the public hearing on HB
80.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
80.
 
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:28.940 align:start position:0%
and we would like to recognize first
 
00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:32.899 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the legislation
 
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
representative Mann to introduce the
 
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.550 align:start position:0%
representative Mann to introduce the
bill

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this bill is ready
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
rededicates money in the Energy
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
taking away its current use in reducing
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
energy bills a very small amount and
 
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
instead using it to fund Energy
 
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.350 align:start position:0%
instead using it to fund Energy
Efficiency

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
and then process of justifying this bill
 
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
I will do uh spend some time talking
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
about Energy Efficiency itself and about
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
the effects of an Energy Efficiency
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
program run by the state
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency fund gets its
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
money from New Hampshire's participation
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
in the regional greenhouse gas
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
initiative or Reggie
 
00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
it's a multi-state pact that turns CO2
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
emissions into money
 
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh that is the that the utility either
 
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
reduce CO2 emissions or pay some money
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
into a kitty that we can use for Energy
 
00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:38.459 align:start position:0%
Efficiency or any uh of a number of um
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
of measures
 
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
since 2012 in New Hampshire most of the
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
kitties been be used for what's called
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
direct bill assistance you're basically
 
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
giving back about
 
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
um 90 cents a month per household on
 
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.590 align:start position:0%
um 90 cents a month per household on
average

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
New England uh the New Hampshire
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
Electric Cooperative showed me a 68
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
cents a month figure for their customers
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
per month this is practically useless
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
assistance that can be outdone Anyway by
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
just handing out a couple of LED bulbs
 
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
um the the bill wants to rededicate that
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
money to Energy Efficiency which is much
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
more useful
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
um the history of the rebate however
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
um was not even uh a decision by any
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
legislatures it was a maneuver to get a
 
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
very ugly lobbyist out of the way
 
00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:40.139 align:start position:0%
essentially uh it was a it was a
 
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote compromise either we were
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
going to get out of Reggie all together
 
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
or we were going to give some money back
 
00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.019 align:start position:0%
to Great payers and and not spend it on
 
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency so this has a
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
historical uh uh source and it is not in
 
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's interest anymore now
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
that we've gotten rid of that lobbyist
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
this goes back to 2012.
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
um Energy Efficiency has a wide range of
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
meanings in industry it's very
 
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
complicated you have opportunities in
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
production processes Transportation
 
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
materials distribution and so on uh for
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
residential buildings it's an awful lot
 
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
simpler uh basically it's reducing heat
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
loss and worrying about moisture because
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
you know ice dams if you do the
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
insulation in the Attic raw things like
 
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.829 align:start position:0%
insulation in the Attic raw things like
that

00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
the state buys about 135 million gallons
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
of heating oil per year it goes to the
 
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
oil industry it goes out of the state
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
and out of the state economy that's
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
money people are not spending it's
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
monies people are not receiving
 
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:49.940 align:start position:0%
uh because people are not spending it
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
it is uh depressing our economy and our
 
00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:54.769 align:start position:0%
it is uh depressing our economy and our
wealth

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
wealth
 
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
so I think it's very important while we
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
have this opportunity with the
 
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
engineering Energy Efficiency
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
a program to uh available to uh to save
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of money and improve our wealth
 
00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:10.139 align:start position:0%
and economy it's um
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to show a little bit of a
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
visual if you don't mind
 
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.590 align:start position:0%
visual if you don't mind
um

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
and the um the idea is to explain why an
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
energy or how an Energy Efficiency
 
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.710 align:start position:0%
energy or how an Energy Efficiency
program

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
accumulates a lot of money so hang on a
 
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:35.530 align:start position:0%
accumulates a lot of money so hang on a

sorry to take my time on this but um it
 
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
was right here a minute ago
 
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.069 align:start position:0%
was right here a minute ago
uh

00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
oh yes hang on
 
00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
representative man I must warn you that
 
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
well I will allow this this morning
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
because we don't have many people signed
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
up to speak on this bill I cannot
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
guarantee that we can allow this to
 
00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:05.459 align:start position:0%
happen in future
 
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
right I understand
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:22.900 align:start position:0%

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative Mann would you suspend
 
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
for a moment yes Jen do you know if uh
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative Mann is authorized to
 
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
okay just verifying thank you do you see
 
00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:51.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%

00:16:55.199 --> 00:16:56.030 align:start position:0%
a picture of people doing work on a
house

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
no sir no you have to use share screen
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we have to use share screen on
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
your bottom
 
00:17:14.289 --> 00:17:14.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
representative man I suggest that you
 
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
include this material in your written
 
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
testimony yes it will be and forego the
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
use of sharing screen during this
 
00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:30.419 align:start position:0%
presentation okay well what happens is
 
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
this let me just do a quick narration
 
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.730 align:start position:0%
this let me just do a quick narration
foreign

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:36.740 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs every year
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
for 10 years the first year
 
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
um you spend you know doing a work on a
 
00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
number of houses in the second year you
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
do another a bunch of work on another
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
set of houses well that while this
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
um second year is
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
implementations being done the work you
 
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
did the previous year is saving money
 
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
to Energy Efficiency and that money is
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
saved year after year after year after
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
year so the money that the work you do
 
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:12.059 align:start position:0%
in the third year adds a little more
 
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
fourth year and so on
 
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
um the way the figure goes and you'll
 
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
see it in the uh in the visual and you
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
can run through the um the
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
slides that I send to you
 
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.250 align:start position:0%
slides that I send to you
um

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
the total amount of wealth that saved
 
00:18:32.169 --> 00:18:32.179 align:start position:0%
accelerates it doesn't grow in a steady
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
steady amount the amount of work that's
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
been done actually goes up linearly but
 
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
the total amount of the effect the
 
00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
Savings in the economy go up uh as a
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
perver ability as an x squared function
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
and that's really important uh
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has been done doing this
 
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
for over
 
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
uh 25 years if they had been doing it
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
for 25 years the number of uh if you
 
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
take the years times savings done in New
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
that's 25 times 26
 
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.169 align:start position:0%
that's 25 times 26
uh

00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
divided by two
 
00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
squared so
 
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.810 align:start position:0%
squared so
um

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
when we're sacrificing Energy Efficiency
 
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
in order to give small amounts of money
 
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
back to ratepayers we are foregoing an
 
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.950 align:start position:0%
back to ratepayers we are foregoing an
enormous

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
enormous
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
potential growth in our wealth
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
a good analogy might be Dunkin Donuts
 
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know you can make a lot of donuts
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
but you can also build a lot of
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
data of Dunkin Donuts stores and each
 
00:19:44.409 --> 00:19:44.419 align:start position:0%
one is a revenue stream
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
each Year's work on Energy Efficiency
 
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
creates a saving stream
 
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
so it has accelerating impact now we
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
either get that savings by doing Energy
 
00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:00.299 align:start position:0%
Efficiency or we hand it over to the oil
 
00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:02.930 align:start position:0%
Efficiency or we hand it over to the oil
companies

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
and so if we're going to insist on
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
giving small amounts of money to our
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
rate payers
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh and pretend that's doing them a favor
 
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
the fact is we're robbing them
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
so we need to pass this bill
 
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
and we need to pay attention to Energy
 
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
Efficiency instead of giving away small
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
change thank you
 
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative man do we have
 
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Mann
 
00:20:35.289 --> 00:20:35.299 align:start position:0%
from the members here in the room
 
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
representative bresney thank you
 
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
chairman for recognizing me just a
 
00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:42.419 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr Mann for your
 
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
testimony my question is you mentioned
 
00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:45.539 align:start position:0%
in the beginning that there were
 
00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
lobbyists who spoke on behalf of the
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
ratepayers to create the rebate can you
 
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
mention who the lobbyists were
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
uh they weren't
 
00:20:55.559 --> 00:20:56.750 align:start position:0%
uh they weren't
um

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
that's not exactly what happened the
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
lobbyist was Corey Lewandowski and this
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
was in 2012 in a bill 1490 HP 1490.
 
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.630 align:start position:0%
was in 2012 in a bill 1490 HP 1490.
um

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
there's a piece of your question I
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
forgot let me think um
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
could you repeat your question again I
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
was just asking what uh who were the
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
lobbyists who lobbied on behalf of the
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
ratepayers to create the rebate yeah he
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
was lobbying on behalf of getting rid of
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
Reggie altogether I suspect it might
 
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
have been part of an effort
 
00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
um by Americans for Prosperity which who
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
he's was representing to dismantle
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
Reggie because they understood the the
 
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
what I've described recently uh they
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
understood the impact on their revenue
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
of something like uh uh the Reggie pact
 
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of States doing
 
00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh things that were going to reduce
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
energy consumption
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
and oil consumption
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
so that was his purpose and I guess he
 
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
was acting a little bit rough and
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
a couple of very slick legislators um
 
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
finagle them into this
 
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.270 align:start position:0%
finagle them into this
hilarious

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
rebate compromise quote quote unquote
 
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
she was unable to uh okay representative
 
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate the answer to
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
the question and we've not seen him
 
00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:31.090 align:start position:0%
the question and we've not seen him
since

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:31.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
next uh question comes from
 
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute yourself
 
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:52.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Pitts and I'm a
 
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on the bill but I'm not
 
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.770 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on the bill but I'm not
presenting

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
presenting
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
though I believe I can ask a question is
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
yes you're recognized to ask a question
 
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative Mann do you
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
um agree that giving a rebate of
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
roughly a dollar a month and not having
 
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
an insulated house
 
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
wastes more energy and that dollar along
 
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
with many more would go out the window
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
yes that's I would definitely agree that
 
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh if you if that dollar doesn't help if
 
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
you're not getting the Energy Efficiency
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
done uh I just looked at a one and a
 
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
half kilowatt
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
space heater and it would cost forty
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
dollars a month to burn for um from uh
 
00:23:53.409 --> 00:23:53.419 align:start position:0%
Sunset to bedtime
 
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
during a month
 
00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:00.059 align:start position:0%
just an enormous difference in cost
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
and that people that are in lousy
 
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
housing are often using space heaters to
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
try to competency
 
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
thank you representative man any
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative Kelly Pitts no
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
so chair now recognizes representative
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative man uh you mentioned
 
00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:27.350 align:start position:0%
uh representative man uh you mentioned
that

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh the average bill is uh paying roughly
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
90 cents a month
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
how much is being diverted
 
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:38.930 align:start position:0%
how much is being diverted
um

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
is currently being diverted from the
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
yeah you're asking me to think
 
00:24:56.159 --> 00:25:01.909 align:start position:0%
yeah you're asking me to think
foreign

00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.049 --> 00:25:06.059 align:start position:0%
well it's 450 000.
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
um households and oh yes sorry yeah the
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
amount actually is five million dollars
 
00:25:15.169 --> 00:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
according to the um the officials that
 
00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:16.490 align:start position:0%
according to the um the officials that
um

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
watch Reggie
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
any follow-up representative pin mintel
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yes a follow-up
 
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.450 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yes a follow-up
um

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
could you give us an idea of what kinds
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
of programs could be run
 
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
that are currently not being run right
 
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
now on five million dollars a year
 
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
um yes I would um
 
00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
of course we have eers coming online but
 
00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:49.250 align:start position:0%
of course we have eers coming online but
generally

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
you would spend that money doing as much
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency as you could you'd
 
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
have publicity you'd have um supervision
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
you'd have quality control and so on
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
um but um my view is
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
um low-income house households can't
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
really take stand to wait for maybe
 
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
eight or ten years before it's their
 
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.059 align:start position:0%
turn to have Energy Efficiency done in
 
00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299 align:start position:0%
their house so a good plan would be to
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
um develop and then uh invent basically
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
develop a program that would do some
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
minimal minimally
 
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
costly but
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
most cost-effective things for houses
 
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
for low-income housing so that at least
 
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
they are somewhat improved
 
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
while they're waiting for their turn now
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
the bill I believe dedicates and I was
 
00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
just I did not make these original
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
suggestions I was just modifying an
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
existing or prior bill from the Senate I
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
believe there's a significant dedication
 
00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
to low income so that they you would
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
prioritize those
 
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
since they can't afford to wait whereas
 
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
the other families like mine can easily
 
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
the other families like mine can easily
wait

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
wait
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Mann
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes representative
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.330 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
um

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:19.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Man
 
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
I my understanding is that Energy
 
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
Efficiency contributes significantly in
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
reducing the overall demand for energy
 
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh for the whole state
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
so that is it is it not accurate to say
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
that by reducing the demand through
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency or other measures uh
 
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
every every rate every rate payer every
 
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
utility payer will get a benefit out of
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
that not just the person installing
 
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency yes that's true that's
 
00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:57.059 align:start position:0%
true at the uh the economy gets better
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
right away
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
um even if you have to wait four or five
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
years before your house is done the
 
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
economy is improving
 
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
um simply because there's more money
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
remaining in the state instead of flying
 
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.769 align:start position:0%
remaining in the state instead of flying
out

00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:12.779 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a follow-up
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
representative samsich yes thank you
 
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
chairman there is uh also uh it is it
 
00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:24.059 align:start position:0%
not true that Energy Efficiency is the
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
cheapest way of reducing your energy
 
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.830 align:start position:0%
cheapest way of reducing your energy
bill

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
and it also reduces uh pollution and
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
yes that's I would agree with that
 
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.630 align:start position:0%
yes that's I would agree with that
absolutely

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
and I forgot to mention of course this
 
00:28:39.049 --> 00:28:39.059 align:start position:0%
job's created
 
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much A lot of people
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
that work with their hands um
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
um and need jobs this is great work good
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
representative man the chair now
 
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:51.539 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Thomas for our
 
00:28:51.539 --> 00:28:53.810 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Thomas for our
question

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman okay
 
00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:00.539 align:start position:0%
thank you there is a man to take my
 
00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.299 align:start position:0%
question uh you mentioned the quantity
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
of somewhere between 60 to 90 cents per
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
month return to our
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
which would be a common residence
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what that is based on
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
how many kilowatt hours per month uh
 
00:29:16.679 --> 00:29:17.870 align:start position:0%
how many kilowatt hours per month uh
usage

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
usage
 
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
yes that's uh that's just taking 450
 
00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:25.100 align:start position:0%
house thousand households that's the
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
Census Bureau tells us tells uh I found
 
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
somewhere tells us that that's the
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
number of households in this state and
 
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
divide 5 million dollars by 450 000 you
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
get about 11. eleven dollars a year or
 
00:29:44.289 --> 00:29:44.299 align:start position:0%
about 90 cents a month
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
a follow-up representative Thomas uh I I
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
guess I need to restate the question
 
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
what what I meant was
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
is that figure based on
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
average household usage of say some say
 
00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:03.179 align:start position:0%
600 kilowatts a month and say it's 650
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours a month is it based on
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
that or or just like you said it's just
 
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
basically the overall money spent
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's not by looking at all the accounts
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
and what they're spending it's just
 
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
simply dividing
 
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
the number of amount of money that's
 
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.470 align:start position:0%
the number of amount of money that's
rebated

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
rebated
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
by the number of households that are in
 
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative man we
 
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
have two more people with their hands
 
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
raised sure at the conclusion of the
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
second question by the second person
 
00:30:45.049 --> 00:30:45.059 align:start position:0%
we're going to move on to the next
 
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
presenter for time because because of
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
time constraints if there's time later
 
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
that'd be that'd be great okay so the
 
00:30:57.169 --> 00:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes uh representative
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%

representative partial for a question
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
yes my school district is struggling to
 
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
reduce operation cost
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
may I assume that this bill would help
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
reduce local property taxes by the
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
installation of such things as cost

efficient LED lighting
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
yes that would be a a you know the town
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
would have to push for it but clearly it
 
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
would it would help the rate payers
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
um I want to thank everybody for the
 
00:31:42.169 --> 00:31:42.179 align:start position:0%

with uh with current statute or as you
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
know maybe proposed under this
 
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm not sure if it's
 
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
possible but normally this bill has been
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
heard several times previously normally
 
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
we testify in conjunction with the uh
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
the puc and my staff Joe Fontaine who is
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
also on I'm not sure if they can be
 
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
promoted at the same time or not in
 
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
order to be able to answer questions uh
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
more efficiently for the committee that
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
might be helpful
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
um if it's if it's so possible I
 
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.349 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
so it would be Joe Fontaine and Karen
 
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
I'll be doing the testimony but and I
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
believe I believe the puc also presented
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
some information to uh
 
00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
to the uh committee
 
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
um a a chart that would help in
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
understanding the reallocation under
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.070 align:start position:0%
this legislation
um

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.080 align:start position:0%

um I I don't I don't know if Karen is
 
00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:52.460 align:start position:0%

there's Karen
um

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
Joe and Karen you'll need to unmute if
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
there's questions also I understand
 
00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:06.950 align:start position:0%
there's questions also I understand
um

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you the uh the state uh began
 
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
its participation in Reggie back in the
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
early 2000s at the time that the
 
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiative was created
 
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.210 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiative was created
um

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
and uh it's an initiative of 10 states
 
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
which uh regulates the emissions of
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide from fossil fuel power
 
00:35:30.119 --> 00:35:31.210 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide from fossil fuel power
plants

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:31.220 align:start position:0%
plants
 
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh plants are allocated a certain amount
 
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
of allowances or an allowance is equal
 
00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:42.740 align:start position:0%
to one ton of emissions of CO2
 
00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.690 align:start position:0%
to one ton of emissions of CO2
and

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
um if they exceed the number of
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
allowances uh they have to purchase
 
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
additional allowances and they have to
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
surrender them uh during a certain time
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
frame and uh true up with their
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
emissions so those allowances are are
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
traded on a uh on like a stock market
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
platform and uh the allowances generate
 
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
Revenue which representative man alluded
 
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
to that Revenue
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
um uh varies with the cost of the
 
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.170 align:start position:0%
um uh varies with the cost of the
allowance

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:20.180 align:start position:0%
allowance
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
initially all of New Hampshire's
 
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
revenues were dedicated to Energy
 
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and as representative man
 
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
indicated back in 2012 there was a uh
 
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
there was a compromise when it was
 
00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
proposed that New Hampshire
 
00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.410 align:start position:0%
proposed that New Hampshire
um

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
be required to leave Reggie and it was
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
changed so that
 
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.410 align:start position:0%
changed so that
um

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
if an allowance sells for say five
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
dollars the way the current allocation
 
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
works is the first dollar of that
 
00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:53.339 align:start position:0%
revenue for the state is uh put into
 
00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:56.339 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs the remaining
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
four dollars are rebated by the puc two
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
rate payers in accordance with
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
um the ratio of commercial and
 
00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:08.099 align:start position:0%
Industrial to
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
um residential rate payers and this bill
 
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
would uh would reallocate and again I'll
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
uh defer to Ms Crampton of the puc and
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
her her chart
 
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
um to uh to help you understand that
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
um I did provide written testimony and
 
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.210 align:start position:0%
um I did provide written testimony and
um

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
uh one of the important things to
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
understand is that New Hampshire is in
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
Reggie because
 
00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's participation in Reggie
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
is better for rate payers than not
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
participating the cost of the the
 
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.770 align:start position:0%
participating the cost of the the
allowances

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
allowances
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
for the fossil fuel plants that are
 
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
covered under this program those costs
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
are carried into their their cost of
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
doing business
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
and are ultimately charged to the rate
 
00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
payer just like fuel
 
00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
um if a utility buys coal or or oil or
 
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:02.220 align:start position:0%
whatever that cost is part of their cost
 
00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
of doing business and that is included
 
00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
um uh in the costs that ultimately the
 
00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
rate payer pays and so
 
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
um that cost
 
00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
is is a fixed cost and and is paid no
 
00:38:20.329 --> 00:38:20.339 align:start position:0%
matter what
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
um if we participate in Reggie we're
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
able to recoup some of that uh those
 
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.870 align:start position:0%
able to recoup some of that uh those
funds

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
um and uh then again those funds can be
 
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
allocated for
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
um the policy directive of the
 
00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:37.619 align:start position:0%
legislature Des takes no position on
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
this legislation we do believe that
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
there are significant benefits and that
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
there's a significant body of
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
information that suggests that
 
00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:48.740 align:start position:0%
investments in Energy Efficiency
 
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
are better for the ratepayer than than
 
00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
rebates however we believe it's the
 
00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
purview of the legislature to determine
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
um and that's that has always been the
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
question so our participation is
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
predicated on the fact that it's better
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
for us to be in the program and get
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
um get the revenues then what's done
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
with the revenues is uh uh is up to the
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
legislature and uh and and that is
 
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
directed in statute now and um this
 
00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
legislation would would redirect some of
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
those funds as was described by
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative Mann
 
00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:28.140 align:start position:0%
um I believe my testimony letter
 
00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
indicated uh some of the studies that
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
have been done both here in New
 
00:39:32.579 --> 00:39:33.370 align:start position:0%
have been done both here in New
Hampshire

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:33.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
legislative studies and some uh
 
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
um some studies that were done by
 
00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:41.780 align:start position:0%
reputable analytical
 
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
consulting firms on behalf of uh
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
um the Reggie program and
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
um so I won't dwell on those I think
 
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
they show that there's significant
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
benefit to the reallocation another
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
thing that was mentioned
 
00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
um uh was the fact that if these
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
revenues are dedicated to Municipal
 
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:09.260 align:start position:0%
purposes schools municipalities Etc
 
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
that they do provide a benefit not only
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
um to the school or the municipality and
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
so on but also to the rate payer by
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
reducing costs for the for the rate
 
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
payer uh for the uh tax taxpayer um in
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
the in the municipalities if uh if a
 
00:40:31.609 --> 00:40:31.619 align:start position:0%
school costs less to heat or less to
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
uses less electricity via lighting then
 
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
um that cost uh directly
 
00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:41.579 align:start position:0%
lowers costs that that investment rather
 
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
directly lowers costs for the uh for the
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
rate payer uh and ultimately the
 
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
ultimately the taxpayer
 
00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:49.990 align:start position:0%
ultimately the taxpayer
um

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.829 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
um so uh we um we again take no position
 
00:40:59.569 --> 00:40:59.579 align:start position:0%
um we're happy to uh uh try to answer
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
any questions on the way the Reggie
 
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.339 align:start position:0%
program works or this uh proposed
 
00:41:05.339 --> 00:41:07.490 align:start position:0%
program works or this uh proposed
reallocation

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
reallocation
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
um and with that I will uh I will
 
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony and uh be prepared
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
to take questions along with Mr Fontaine
 
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
and Ms Crampton from the puc and I'm I

00:41:22.609 --> 00:41:22.619 align:start position:0%
anything to what I've said I
 
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:start position:0%

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
hear that as well
 
00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:29.099 align:start position:0%
Ms Crampton did you want to add anything
 
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Fitzgerald's testimony if so please
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
unmute yourself
 
00:41:36.609 --> 00:41:36.619 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
committee this is Karen Crampton from
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission uh as Mr
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald stated we provided the
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
graphics which attempts to illustrate
 
00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:49.700 align:start position:0%
how Reggie currently allocates funding
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
and what the amendment the effects of
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment would have on that program
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
allocation and
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
um the puc takes no position on this
 
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
bill however I am here to answer any
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have on that
 
00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:06.980 align:start position:0%
allocation so thank you very much
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
Thomas for a question
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
let me ask our committee research here
 
00:42:35.569 --> 00:42:35.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
we ask our committee researcher on my
 
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.170 align:start position:0%
we ask our committee researcher on my
screen

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
when I see a list of Representatives
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
with their hands up
 
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
how can I tell which one put their hand
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
up first
 
00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:50.099 align:start position:0%
they are listed in the order in which
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
they were raised so I'm seeing
 
00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
representative samsich Thomas
 
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
00:42:59.690 --> 00:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
my screen it goes representative Thomas
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
representative samsich you know
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
do you have the the participant list
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
open represent
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
I don't have it open right at the moment
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
no yeah if you open the participant list
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
it shows them in order whereas on your
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
screen it may be in a different order if
 
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the tiles
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
okay I did not know that thank you for
 
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.730 align:start position:0%
okay I did not know that thank you for
that

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
Clarity on
 
00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:32.690 align:start position:0%
Clarity on
that so

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
okay chair recognizes representative
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.329 --> 00:43:40.339 align:start position:0%
wasn't there a question from
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas that we didn't
 
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh question
 
00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:50.339 align:start position:0%
representative oxen I'm representative
 
00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
Thomas said and I'm sorry you didn't
 
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
hear it but he said that he thought that
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
represent representative samsich was
 
00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.910 align:start position:0%
represent representative samsich was
first

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
discussion about how to determine who's
 
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.130 align:start position:0%
discussion about how to determine who's
first

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
so representative samsonshire recognized
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
for a question uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Fitzgerald uh so I just
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
want to clarify what you just said
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
regarding uh whether our participation
 
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
in Reggie uh are not non-participation
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
would be a disadvantage so if I
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
understand what you said correctly and
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
please correct me if I'm wrong here
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
because that's why I want to know
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
um since we all buy from the same
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
wholesale energy Market all the
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
producers producing energy into the
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
wholesale Market have already factored
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
the cost of Reggie for all the other
 
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
States involved into their pricing
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
and so therefore when we buy energy from
 
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
them that's already factored in as part
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
of their pricing however if we're not
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
part of Reggie we don't get any benefits
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
from the auctions to compensate for that
 
00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:05.339 align:start position:0%
additional cost is that correct
 
00:45:08.089 --> 00:45:08.099 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely correct and although
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation does not
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh address the state's participation in
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
Reggie it presumes that we continue to
 
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.849 align:start position:0%
Reggie it presumes that we continue to
participate

00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
um I I just pointed that out for
 
00:45:19.079 --> 00:45:20.630 align:start position:0%
um I I just pointed that out for
clarification

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
um uh as background information but yes
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
you are correct
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative samsich follow-up uh yes
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I I wanted to
 
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
just ask uh in light of the fact that
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
this money is being used currently uh uh
 
00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
the amount we're getting the one dollar
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
out of the five
 
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
um how many projects that qualify to get
 
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:44.870 align:start position:0%
um how many projects that qualify to get
such

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
such
 
00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:47.579 align:start position:0%
um Energy Efficiency measures what
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
percentage are we able to fund with that
 
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
amount uh and uh how much more would we
 
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
need to fund all the projects currently
 
00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
uh in queue
 
00:45:58.740 --> 00:45:59.270 align:start position:0%
uh in queue
um

00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
I will attempt to address that a little
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
bit and then I'll deter them as Crampton
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
because they're the agency that uh runs
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
the program but I just want to point out
 
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
um the first dollar uh of each allowance
 
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
sale goes into the Energy Efficiency
 
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
programs that are run by the puc
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
administered by the puc and run by the
 
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.309 align:start position:0%
administered by the puc and run by the
utilities

00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
um and those programs are by definition
 
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
cost effective
 
00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that there is a
 
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
significant waiting list for those
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
programs uh I don't know I I could not
 
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
quote you specific numbers
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
um that those those programs
 
00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
um again are continually funded but the
 
00:46:47.569 --> 00:46:47.579 align:start position:0%
the limitation is the current funding
 
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
um and with that I would defer to Ms
 
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
Crampton to if there's any other any
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
further information that would be
 
00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.990 align:start position:0%
further information that would be
helpful

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:04.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
be sure to raise your hand the thing you
 
00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
explain so but I can try
 
00:47:11.819 --> 00:47:13.670 align:start position:0%
explain so but I can try
here

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.050 align:start position:0%
here
yeah

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
did you want to go to representative
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
Thomas first sir okay
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
um yes sir thank you chair for taking my
 
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
question yes sir thank you for uh
 
00:47:34.849 --> 00:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
providing your testimony today one
 
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
question I I did have and if you could
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
just clarify does this bill change the
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
amount of money that's available to
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
residential customers in the New
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh yes I would defer to Ms script into
 
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps go over that allocation
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
document but yes it does in fact
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
increase the uh amount of money going in
 
00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair if you'd like I can add a
 
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
little bit to that
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
a little detail to Mr Fitzgerald's
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
response yes please respond
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
um based on the illustrative diagrams
 
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
that I provided uh the puc provided as
 
00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.130 align:start position:0%
that I provided uh the puc provided as
testimony

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
um assuming that the Reggie auction
 
00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
revenue is approximately 17 million
 
00:48:29.809 --> 00:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
dollars you can see by looking at the
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
left hand side of those charts that
 
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:33.740 align:start position:0%
under the current law
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
approximately 2.9 Million Dollars would
 
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
be used for funding Energy Efficiency
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
programs in the state
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
with this amendment that amount uh
 
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
increases to approximately 6.7 million
 
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
dollars so yes there is an increase of
 
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
funding and then the
 
00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:54.910 align:start position:0%
funding and then the
the

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
boxes below
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh show you how that's allocated and
 
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
both bills or the current law and the
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
amendment both provide an allocation for
 
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities and schools and local
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
government for Energy Efficiency there's
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
an allocation set aside for low-income
 
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and then the balance
 
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
goes to fund an all fuels program which
 
00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
currently is administered by the puc as
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
a competitive bid
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
um and I can go through those breakdowns
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
but basically
 
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
um municipalities schools and local
 
00:49:32.089 --> 00:49:32.099 align:start position:0%
governments would
 
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
get an increased allocation from 2
 
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
million up to 5 million
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
the low income goes from a minimum of 15
 
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
to a minimum of 35 percent
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
and then the balance is of course the
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
all fuels program
 
00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Crampton uh I'd like you
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
to stop there please yes we're down to
 
00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
the last 10 minutes of this public
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
hearing so the future questioners will
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
be limited to one question each and the
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Thomas
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chair I
 
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:08.180 align:start position:0%
thank you my question uh really quick
 
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
what other programs in the state or
 
00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:13.550 align:start position:0%
what other programs in the state or
federal

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
also contribute to the Energy Efficiency
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas the uh systems
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
benefit charge
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
um uh from the uh again a puc
 
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
administered program that charges is on
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
your uh on your bill those funds also uh
 
00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
are allocated to a you know portion of
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
them are allocated to the uh Energy
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund and and thus then into
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency programs
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that answer the chair
 
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Pimentel for a
 
00:50:56.700 --> 00:51:00.470 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Pimentel for a
question

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:03.770 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
are there other states in Reggie that
 
00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
are diverting their funds
 
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
uh to the ratepayers
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
are we the only one
 
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
um I I believe there are uh there are
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
other states that have a portion um I
 
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
believe ours is probably the uh
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh the lowest amount
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
um you know where when we're only
 
00:51:32.329 --> 00:51:32.339 align:start position:0%
allocating one dollar out of the five or
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
or whatever the allowance price is
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that
 
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
um it was uh in my testimony letter that
 
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
more than 50 percent of the uh uh the
 
00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:47.579 align:start position:0%
states uh the total funding from the
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
states does go to Energy Efficiency but
 
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
there are other funds diverted for other
 
00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
uses in the states and I would also open
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
it up to Mr Fontaine if if he has any
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
um additional information that could
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
help with that response
 
00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:09.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
I could Mr Fitzgerald I could jump in
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
quickly I think um Reggie Inc uh
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
generates or or produces an annual
 
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
proceeds report that shows state by
 
00:52:22.609 --> 00:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
state how every state uses their Reggie
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
proceeds and now I did see Joe's unmuted
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Joe unmuted thank you
 
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
um yes that's what I was gonna say Karen
 
00:52:32.569 --> 00:52:32.579 align:start position:0%
was the answers to a lot of your
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
questions uh may be found at the Reggie
 
00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
and they have uh an annual report on
 
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.150 align:start position:0%
and they have uh an annual report on
their

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
that shows how the money is spent by
 
00:52:51.049 --> 00:52:51.059 align:start position:0%
each state
 
00:52:53.809 --> 00:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
we could follow up and send to send to
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
the committee members a link to that
 
00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.329 align:start position:0%
the committee members a link to that
report

00:52:56.329 --> 00:52:56.339 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that response uh the
 
00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:00.500 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes representative
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
McGee for the
 
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
um Mike my question is around uh you
 
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
know I think what the committee is
 
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
grappling with here is whether this is a
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
good build for New Hampshire whether
 
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's worthy of our our votes to move it
 
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
forward and I wanted to ask the question
 
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
of the way I see Energy Efficiency is
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
that it lowers demand and therefore it
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
lowers costs and so it's kind of this
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
program is sort of a force multiplier
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
for helping us to lower those energy
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
costs that come from the transmission
 
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
piece that we have about 9.5 percent of
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
as far as you know our regional
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
um partnership goes so please ask a
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
question representative yeah so what I'm
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
asking is is that a correct assumption
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
um passing this bill would create uh
 
00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
would continue that Force multiplier so
 
00:53:58.809 --> 00:53:58.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:58.819 --> 00:54:00.370 align:start position:0%
 
assumption

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:00.380 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
um and again investments in Energy
 
00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:09.059 align:start position:0%
Efficiency lower overall demand
 
00:54:14.329 --> 00:54:14.339 align:start position:0%
um and in uh in addition there's another
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
factor that um more recently has come to
 
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
be better understood is that when demand
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
is lowered the the cost of the
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
transmission system in New England is
 
00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:27.059 align:start position:0%
apportioned among all the New England
 
00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
states based on their demand so when
 
00:54:32.329 --> 00:54:32.339 align:start position:0%
States lower their demand
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
um they also lower their percentage of
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
the required uh you know if they're
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
going to invest if ISO is going to
 
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
invest 10 million over the next 10 years
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
in in uh transmission say or or 100
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
million whatever
 
00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
um that that cost
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh it can be reduced by reducing our
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
portion of the demand in other words if
 
00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
we pay if we're 9.5 percent of the iso
 
00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.510 align:start position:0%
we pay if we're 9.5 percent of the iso
load

00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
load
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
um we would pay one cost if we're 10 we
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
would pay
 
00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:06.500 align:start position:0%
another half percent higher
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
portion of that cost and so by lowering
 
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
demand we not only lower
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
um the cost to the direct rate payer
 
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
um to the direct uh uh entity that
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
lowers their uh invest the money and
 
00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:25.140 align:start position:0%
lowers their cost but uh then that
 
00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
lowers demand to all rate payers and
 
00:55:31.609 --> 00:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
um that also translates into reduced
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
demand to for for the entire uh uh
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
system and reduce costs
 
00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:40.140 align:start position:0%
that's the point in your testimony I was
 
00:55:41.809 --> 00:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
trying to get to okay I'm gonna have to
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
cut you off there it is now three
 
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
minutes before ten
 
00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
Mr Fitzgerald we thank you uh and Miss
 
00:55:50.089 --> 00:55:50.099 align:start position:0%
Crampton and Mr Fontaine for your
 
00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
testimony here this morning we have one
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
more person who would like to speak this
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
morning so the chair recognizes now Mr
 
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
you will be allowed to speak
 
00:56:07.849 --> 00:56:07.859 align:start position:0%
please unmute yourself
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
and tell us if you have any new points
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
to make other than the points that have
 
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman can you hear
 
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.049 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman can you hear
me

00:56:21.049 --> 00:56:21.059 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
we can yes
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and uh the
 
00:56:24.359 --> 00:56:25.609 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and uh the
committee

00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
um I'm today providing oral testimony in
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
support of house bill 80. my support is
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
based on the following reasons one as a
 
00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:35.339 align:start position:0%
member of the original a Reggie
 
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
stakeholders committee I helped shake
 
00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
the objectives of Reggie one of the
 
00:56:40.849 --> 00:56:40.859 align:start position:0%
objectives of Reggie was obviously to
 
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel
 
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
power plants in the Reggie participating
 
00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:45.710 align:start position:0%
power plants in the Reggie participating
States

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
but there was a second just as important
 
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
objective and that was to allow allocate
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
the carbon emission auction proceeds
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
back to the participating states with
 
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
the attention of reinvesting the
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
proceeds in Energy Efficiency measures
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
in those States unfortunately at least
 
00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
50 percent of current Reggie proceeds
 
00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339 align:start position:0%
are sent back to Bill payers
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
as direct refunds these refunds which
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
may not even be recognized by Bill
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
payers nothing to reduce the demand for
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
electricity in the participating ready
 
00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:15.410 align:start position:0%
electricity in the participating ready
States

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
if those rebates are invested in Energy
 
00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
Efficiency they would according to
 
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
reputable studies return over the long
 
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
term through lower energy costs
 
00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
approximately four dollars to Consumers
 
00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
for every dollar invested in Energy
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
Efficiency much better return than
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
simply returning cash rebase to
 
00:57:31.559 --> 00:57:32.809 align:start position:0%
simply returning cash rebase to
customers

00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
customers
 
00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
second Energy Efficiency saves money for
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
all electric bill payers in our New
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
England electric Distribution Systems by
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
reducing the importation of electricity
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
from out-of-state sources thus reducing
 
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:46.140 align:start position:0%
the outflow of our scarce energy dollars
 
00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
into surrounding states
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
it also reduces carbon emissions helps
 
00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
lower electricity costs to Bill payers
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
especially to low-income Bill payers
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
enables New Hampshire's distribution
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
utilities to delay or even eliminate
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
expensive infrastructure upgrades and
 
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
provides good paying jobs right here in
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire how can that be bad for
 
00:58:05.809 --> 00:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
the citizens
 
00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
third item
 
00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
House Bill 80 is consistent with and
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
supports the proposed but not your
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
triennial Energy Efficiency plan now
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
waiting approval by the public school
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
commute utility submission and lastly
 
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
the bill takes at least one step in the
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
right direction in allocating today's
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
residential rebate for Reggie reflected
 
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
the non-on-going Energy Efficiency
 
00:58:31.609 --> 00:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
programs in New Hampshire do what's
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
right for New Hampshire's electric bill
 
00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
papers thank you Mr chairman appreciate
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
the time today
 
00:58:39.789 --> 00:58:39.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr quasnick for your testimony
 
00:58:42.849 --> 00:58:42.859 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't have time to
 
00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
allow any questions of Mr kwasnick I
 
00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:49.140 align:start position:0%
want to thank everyone who presented on
 
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
this bill this morning
 
00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
and I would also like to alert everyone
 
00:58:56.089 --> 00:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
that it is possible that there will be
 
00:58:58.609 --> 00:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
an executive session on this bill later
 
00:58:58.619 --> 00:59:00.530 align:start position:0%
an executive session on this bill later
today

00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
so with that I will close
 
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.730 align:start position:0%

ah

00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
ah
 
00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas will announce now
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
now the result of the blue sheet
 
00:59:18.599 --> 00:59:19.849 align:start position:0%
now the result of the blue sheet
but

00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
according to the sheet here uh we signed
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
in we have 25
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
Pro and zero opposed and two neutral
 
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry repeat that please
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
could you please repeat that we couldn't
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
hear it
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
oh I'll repeat it then there were 25
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
people who signed to end on this bill
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
most were in support there were two that
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
were neutral
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
so with that we'll close the public
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 80.
 
01:00:01.609 --> 01:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
take a two minute break before we
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
reconvene for our next public hearing
 
01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
thank you chair

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
once I hit the king of Angus I didn't
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%

01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
well it's only an issue because if we're
 
01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
not locked into the zoom uh people in
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
the room can't get their hand up in
 
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
queue like we are waiting till the
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
testimony is over if you're home on Zoom
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
you could raise your hand while they're
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
speaking and then all of a sudden you're
 
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
in queue so it
 
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
you know people in the room just don't
 
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
do that aren't doing that okay
 
01:03:58.730 --> 01:03:58.740 align:start position:0%
so I aired on that
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
the first public hearings you're
 
01:04:00.119 --> 01:04:01.370 align:start position:0%
the first public hearings you're
learning

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
learning
 
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
so from here on out before I recognize
 
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
stay in the room lights in the room
 
01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
okay welcome back everyone
 
01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
HB 382
 
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
and I will recognize the prime sponsor
 
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
of the bill to introduce the bill
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
that is Peter leishman
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.849 --> 01:05:03.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
I apologize I misspoke that's
 
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative policeman
 
01:05:13.329 --> 01:05:13.339 align:start position:0%
oh not not a problem Mr chairman
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr chairman members of
 
01:05:19.609 --> 01:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm here in support of HB
 
01:05:19.619 --> 01:05:21.589 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm here in support of HB
382.

01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
382.
 
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
several years ago I learned of seasonal
 
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:27.299 align:start position:0%
demand charges due to a railroad
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
crossing accident with a large dump
 
01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.829 align:start position:0%
crossing accident with a large dump
truck

01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
truck
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
one of my trains collided with a truck
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
and the accident prevented the railroad
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
from serving an aggregate plant due to
 
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
the Damage Done to some of the railroads
 
01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.210 align:start position:0%
the Damage Done to some of the railroads
equipment

01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:05:44.329 --> 01:05:44.339 align:start position:0%
as a result the aggregate plant shut
 
01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:46.619 align:start position:0%
down due to the lack of material that
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
the railroad was able to deliver
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
it was then I learned that the aggregate
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
plant was still required to pay a
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
monthly demand charge whether they used
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
electricity or not
 
01:06:02.329 --> 01:06:02.339 align:start position:0%
in time the railroad did receive a
 
01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
settlement from the truck driver's
 
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
insurance company which included a seven
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar check to cover the
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
two-week portion of the monthly demand
 
01:06:11.819 --> 01:06:13.309 align:start position:0%
two-week portion of the monthly demand
charge

01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
charge
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
this past summer
 
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
due to grid issues the same aggregate
 
01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
plant lost power on several occasions
 
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
and electric motors and soft start
 
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
equipment was damaged
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
nearly three weeks of production time
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
was lost
 
01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
the utility was asked for a demand
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
charge credit due to the interruption of
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
power that request was declined
 
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
how fair is that
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
prior to the filing of HB 382 I had no
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
idea that the New Hampshire that New
 
01:06:51.289 --> 01:06:51.299 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's largest utility has more
 
01:06:53.329 --> 01:06:53.339 align:start position:0%
than 78
 
01:06:56.089 --> 01:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
000 customers that are subject to some
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
form of demand charge
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
I learned that the monthly demand
 
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
charges are especially impactful on many
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
seasonal businesses and oftentimes these
 
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
charges are dictating when seasonal
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
businesses can either resume operation
 
01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
or cease their operations due to weather
 
01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
or other factors
 
01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:21.299 align:start position:0%
I know for a fact in the aggregate
 
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
business these monthly demand charges
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
are limiting production as weather is
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
often a factor in the early spring or
 
01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
fall due to freezing temperatures and
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
paying a monthly demand charge of
 
01:07:36.049 --> 01:07:36.059 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars for a few days or a
 
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
week of production makes little sense
 
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
I have also learned that ski areas are
 
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
also experiencing the same type of
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
impacts during their seasonal operations
 
01:07:51.049 --> 01:07:51.059 align:start position:0%
as I think many of you know
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
several years ago the New Hampshire
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
asked large on-site generators to
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
connect to the grid
 
01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
economically and perhaps environmentally
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
it was felt that by connecting these
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
large Industrial
 
01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
on-site generators to the grid would
 
01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:21.299 align:start position:0%
improve air quality as one major
 
01:08:21.299 --> 01:08:24.050 align:start position:0%
improve air quality as one major
interest

01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
air expanse New Hampshire businesses
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
connected to the grid
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
it was not uncommon for these business
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
owners to spend tens of thousands of
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
dollars to upgrade their New Hampshire
 
01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:36.890 align:start position:0%
dollars to upgrade their New Hampshire
plants

01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
plants
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
at the time it was thought these
 
01:08:42.169 --> 01:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
conversions would be a win-win or again
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
the businesses and the environment
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
however before the conversion to the
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
grid businesses with on-site generators
 
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
weren't impacted by demand charges and
 
01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
could make business decisions without
 
01:08:58.849 --> 01:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
the fear of monthly demand charges being
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
assessed for little or no electrical
 
01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
assessed for little or no electrical
usage

01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
usage
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
well these demand charges encourage
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
businesses to return to off-site power
 
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
production or worse
 
01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I believe it is time for a
 
01:09:16.849 --> 01:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
diverse group of stakeholders to take a
 
01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
look at demand charges in the harmful
 
01:09:19.739 --> 01:09:21.169 align:start position:0%
look at demand charges in the harmful
effect

01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
these demand charges are having on New
 
01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business and I thank you and I
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%

thank you representative leishman for
 
01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:34.870 align:start position:0%

introducing
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
Bill HB 382
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions from the
 
01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
members assembled in the room here this
 
01:09:44.699 --> 01:09:48.169 align:start position:0%
members assembled in the room here this
morning

01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
chairman that question thank you
 
01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative for
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh for my question just real brief this
 
01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
bill as I understand it is a bill for a
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.209 align:start position:0%
study committee
correctly

01:10:05.209 --> 01:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:10:05.219 --> 01:10:07.689 align:start position:0%
correctly
yes

01:10:07.689 --> 01:10:07.699 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
or a commission so my question is
 
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
why do you feel like we need a
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
commission to to study um
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
on this bill it seems like you're
 
01:10:24.649 --> 01:10:24.659 align:start position:0%
testimony was more as to uh we need that
 
01:10:26.530 --> 01:10:26.540 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to actually do something
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
okay tell me why you feel like you need
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
that we need to have a commission on
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
this have you determined is too complex
 
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
or or what what issues did you find out
 
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
that the improvements that we have to
 
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
have a commission on this
 
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for the question uh several
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
years ago a number of issues were raised
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh concerning actually the Secretary of
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
State and the Department of
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and some of you
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
may remember governor sunoon who issued
 
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
an executive order to look into a number
 
01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
of different things to improve business
 
01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:01.820 align:start position:0%
in the State uh that was executive order
 
01:11:05.689 --> 01:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
2017.02 I believe and as a result uh
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
members of the house including former
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
speaker hinch and I were on that
 
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
committee or commission and we came up
 
01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
with a number of recommendations uh
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
based on our work which turned into
 
01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 11.
 
01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
o4 I believe it was in 2018 which was
 
01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
passed by the house and the complexity
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the things we found at DES we're glad
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
that there was actually a group put
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
together to look at DES and the
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and other
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
agencies to try to improve the business
 
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
climate New Hampshire and I think as I
 
01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
found the complexity of demand charges
 
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
I'll be perfectly honest this is the
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
first time I've ever even got to the
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
surface of demand charges and I think a
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
diverse group of a few select
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislators from is to build calls for
 
01:11:54.649 --> 01:11:54.659 align:start position:0%
from your committee and one from the
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
Senate side but stakeholders I think can
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
provide valuable input the utilities for
 
01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
instance I think everyone should be
 
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
brought to the table but that it being a
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
very complex issue I think it needs a
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
great deal of work to come up with some
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
good Solutions
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up representative
 
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.570 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up representative
Thomas

thank you are there any other members uh
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
if not the chair recognizes
 
01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:26.580 align:start position:0%

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
Mr alishman
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
um uh just to comment uh point of order
 
01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
to the chair if I may
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
um we here have a hard time hearing uh
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
the voices of the people in the
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
conference room so if you could please
 
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
ask them to speak up loudly so we can
 
01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
hear what they have to say uh just uh as
 
01:12:52.209 --> 01:12:52.219 align:start position:0%
a request on my part
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for that comment uh in
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
case you were joined us late I did make
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
that request of the members in the room
 
01:13:02.570 --> 01:13:02.580 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the meeting but I
 
01:13:05.050 --> 01:13:05.060 align:start position:0%
will repeat it uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
so Mr lishman um I just wondered uh
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
aside from the business Community are
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
are you also aware that even churches
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
who may only have one service per week
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
are actually charged the demand charge
 
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
as well as their electric usage which
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
yes as I've learned actually eversource
 
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
has been very helpful and provided me
 
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
with some uh interesting documentation
 
01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
and I was completely unaware that uh you
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
know like you just pointed out even
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
people that may use electricity uh once
 
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
a week for say a church service or also
 
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
subject to demand charge to me it's
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
something uh you should pay for when you
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
need it not to just have it on a standby
 
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
situation because anybody that's facing
 
01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
these demand charges uh especially
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
during the time right now that we're in
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
an economic crisis being stuck with
 
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
these huge charges when they're not even
 
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
using electricity is just a very
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
problematic in my in my thinking
 
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative some such a
 
01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:14.870 align:start position:0%
thank you representative some such a
follow-up

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you Mr chairman uh Mr uh is
 
01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
it has it been your experience that
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
you've said the demand charges often are
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
higher than the actual electricity
 
01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.169 align:start position:0%
higher than the actual electricity
tragedy

01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
tragedy
 
01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
I I have I have seen some of that I've
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
heard it I don't know it for a complete
 
01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
fact but I believe that's probably
 
01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.189 align:start position:0%
fact but I believe that's probably
correct

01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and the
 
01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.490 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and the
answer

01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:42.500 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative leishman I have a
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
sure how can the utilities
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
adequately plan uh for their load
 
01:14:56.689 --> 01:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
uh if they do not
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
if they cannot
 
01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
make these demand charges on users who
 
01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
usually occasionally use a large amount
 
01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
of electricity but not always so how can
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
the utility plan for and guarantee that
 
01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:16.820 align:start position:0%
that the supply will be available
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
without these demand charges
 
01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you raised an
 
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
excellent uh point a question and my
 
01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
feeling and my response to that is the
 
01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
need for a commission to look into
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that answer
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
so next we go to
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
oxygen for a question
 
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my question was just
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh the chair recognizes
 
01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative leishman if
 
01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
if companies or churches or
 
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
organizations face these demand charges
 
01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
can they
 
01:16:13.729 --> 01:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
get around those charges by having a
 
01:16:13.739 --> 01:16:16.850 align:start position:0%
get around those charges by having a
contract

01:16:16.850 --> 01:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
um contract
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
sure I can always speak to the uh
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
aggregate company that I'm familiar with
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
they have been unsuccessful in
 
01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
developing any sort of contract
 
01:16:31.490 --> 01:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
arrangement with the utility that serves
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
them I can tell you one of the things
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's I've noticed uh this company
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
operates around
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and all over New Hampshire
 
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
as well they have facilities in
 
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that they have left
 
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
um on on-site generation in their
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
quarries and their plants so they're not
 
01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:54.659 align:start position:0%
subject to the demand charge because
 
01:16:57.169 --> 01:16:57.179 align:start position:0%
they found it so punitive so we're
 
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
seeing the impact of uh companies
 
01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
electing to keep their on-site
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
generators because it's cheaper and they
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
can turn on the plants when the weather
 
01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
is conducive to production or shut the
 
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
things down without being penalized by a
 
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
demand chart so the
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
hope that the Department of
 
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services had put out there
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
a few years ago to get these on-site
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
generators removed to improve air
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
quality the demand charges are forcing
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
companies to take another look at
 
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
keeping their on-site generators
 
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
follow up about Representative
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
no thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
that raised my hand
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
by accident I thought you did no
 
01:17:59.570 --> 01:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
apologies did you not
 
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
I did not know
 
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
okay I apologize for calling on you so
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
apparently we have no more questions for
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative leishman so
 
01:18:14.410 --> 01:18:14.420 align:start position:0%
next I will call on the next speaker
 
01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
Madeline Monroe representing clean
 
01:18:19.090 --> 01:18:19.100 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire
 
01:18:32.530 --> 01:18:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vose and uh thank you
 
01:18:36.729 --> 01:18:36.739 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony today
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives clean energy New
 
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire supports house bill 382.
 
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
um demand charges are something that we
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about and that we work a lot
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
on uh with the work that we do we hear
 
01:18:50.090 --> 01:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
from churches and schools that are being
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
hammered by these demand charges and
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
trying to understand them better and
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how they can manage
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
their energy use
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
um to better reduce those demand charges
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
and that's something that we help them
 
01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
with to the best of our ability but as I
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned in my written testimony the
 
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:06.659 align:start position:0%
information that customers can get from
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
utilities about their demand charges the
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
detailed energy usage and how they can
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
manage those demand charges is quite
 
01:19:16.729 --> 01:19:16.739 align:start position:0%
limited so that can be challenging we do
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
think that demand charges deserve
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
careful consideration and study and we
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative leishman
 
01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
for bringing this issue to the Forefront
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
by introducing this bill
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
as I also mentioned in our written
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
testimony we do think however that the
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
scope of the commission should be
 
01:19:36.169 --> 01:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
expanded specifically to address how
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
demand charges affect electric vehicle
 
01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.910 align:start position:0%
demand charges affect electric vehicle
charging

01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
charging
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
uh energy storage battery charging
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
and how demand charges are calculated
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
affects the payback of Energy Efficiency
 
01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.430 align:start position:0%
affects the payback of Energy Efficiency
um Investments

01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
um Investments
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
we also so we ask that the scope of the
 
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
commission be expanded to add these
 
01:19:57.890 --> 01:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
issues as well as Representatives on the
 
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
commission with specific expertise in
 
01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony I'm happy to take
 
01:20:07.630 --> 01:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Ms minnow
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
so far I only see a couple of hands
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
raised are there any questions from
 
01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
anyone here in the room
 
01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:23.219 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to be vigilant about making
 
01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
sure I don't miss any ends up there in
 
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
your group
 
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
so before I go to the uh the other
 
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
questioners I have a question for you Ms
 
01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.490 align:start position:0%
questioners I have a question for you Ms
minnow

01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
minnow
 
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
you you know that the the demand charges
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
come from the regulated utilities
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
primarily and since they are regulated
 
01:20:47.229 --> 01:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
one would assume that the puc has some
 
01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
oversight authority over demand charges
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
if the POC thinks demand charges are
 
01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
legitimate and useful uh is there
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
a question about whether that's true or
 
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
not is that why you think maybe this
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
committee is necessary
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
um no I as I mentioned my testimony
 
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
we're actually actively working on
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
specific issues related to demand
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
charges in dockets related to electric
 
01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
vehicle charging and energy storage uh
 
01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
more generally the puc moves very slowly
 
01:21:26.209 --> 01:21:26.219 align:start position:0%
and I think does appreciate policy
 
01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
direction from the legislature and so I
 
01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
think it may be helpful to specify
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
certain policy recommendations to the
 
01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
puc if the legislature or this study
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair now recognizes
 
01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
representative some search for a
 
01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:50.990 align:start position:0%
representative some search for a
question

01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
Ms minnow
 
01:21:54.659 --> 01:21:55.430 align:start position:0%
Ms minnow
um

01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
can you uh enlighten me whether I got
 
01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
this right but I believe that the way
 
01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
the demand charges are usually charged
 
01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
is in any given month uh what the
 
01:22:09.649 --> 01:22:09.659 align:start position:0%
highest Spike of usage is
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
in a very small time interval maybe
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
within half an hour interval or
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
something and that is used to charge the
 
01:22:19.729 --> 01:22:19.739 align:start position:0%
use for the demand charge is that
 
01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
correct yes most uh commercial
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
industrial customers are on a much more
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
detailed metering than a residential
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
customer for example and so their usage
 
01:22:32.209 --> 01:22:32.219 align:start position:0%
is considered in 15-minute increments
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
and it is whatever 15 minute increment
 
01:22:37.610 --> 01:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
in the month that you hit the highest
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
usage that is what your demand charge
 
01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
will be based on but as I mentioned some
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the utilities also use an annual
 
01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
ratchet so it will also be whatever the
 
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
15-minute increment was the highest in
 
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
the whole year and so even if you make a
 
01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
huge change in our energy usage in
 
01:22:59.570 --> 01:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
November you won't and you won't see a
 
01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:02.219 align:start position:0%
reduction in your demand charge for a
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
whole year until the following November
 
01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:10.870 align:start position:0%
whole year until the following November
um

01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:14.209 --> 01:23:14.219 align:start position:0%
a follow-up representative samsich yes
 
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so so what in
 
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
response to what you just said I I
 
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
understand that if if I were and I've
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
done this with my church and I I said
 
01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
you know if you guys Implement Energy
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
Efficiency uh not only do you reduce
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
your electric usage but you also reduce
 
01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
your demand charge that correct yes
 
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
that's correct if you can either Target
 
01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
whatever is causing that one spike in
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
your usage or just reduce your usage
 
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
overall your demand charge will also be
 
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
reduced and so for some
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
um commercial customers that can be a
 
01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
specific piece of equipment that Cycles
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
on and off so you could change that from
 
01:23:58.610 --> 01:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
uh to a variable drive for example so
 
01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
that it it doesn't Spike on and Spike
 
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
off or you can put a specific piece of
 
01:24:04.729 --> 01:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
equipment on a battery
 
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
um it is possible to manage demand
 
01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
charges in many cases but it can be very
 
01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
costly to hire a consultant to get
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes they have to put on more
 
01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
detailed metering than they're able to
 
01:24:18.169 --> 01:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
get from the utility and to be able to
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
to to sort of get to the root cause of
 
01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
what is causing the one you know price
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
usage Spike that that causes their
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
demand charge
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair now recognizes
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Harrington for a
 
01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:41.930 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Harrington for a
question

01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh hello can you hear me
 
01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
yes yes okay uh my question was simply
 
01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
uh I thought there was a way to really
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
reduce charges I look back to the few
 
01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
years back when Westinghouse was testing
 
01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
react the coolant pump motors on the
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
Seacoast and they had interruptible
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
power so the utility was able to say
 
01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
turn off those pumps now we we can't
 
01:25:05.689 --> 01:25:05.699 align:start position:0%
give you that power and that was able to
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
drastically reduce their demand charge
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
is that option still available for or
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
any large user
 
01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
um I think you're talking about demand
 
01:25:16.669 --> 01:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
response programs and yes as part of our
 
01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
eers and our energy excuse me I wasn't
 
01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
talking about demand responses okay
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
interruptible Power what it means is
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
they would test these reactive coolant
 
01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
pump motors would suck up huge amounts
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
of electricity and they will cut
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
customers of public service at the time
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
and public service can simply say shut
 
01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
off your Motors now and they agreed to
 
01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
do that and so they were able to
 
01:25:38.689 --> 01:25:38.699 align:start position:0%
substantially lower their demand and I I
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
believe it's still a negotiable thing
 
01:25:42.649 --> 01:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
that companies can do with the utilities
 
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
simply say during a certain time I'm
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
going to have to tell you not to use
 
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
that much power and they have obviously
 
01:25:50.090 --> 01:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
the company would have to agree to it
 
01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
and then we'd save money is that still
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
in effect I do believe that is still a
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
tariff in effect for eversource
 
01:25:57.770 --> 01:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
customers so they would be able to opt
 
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
into that thank you
 
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative Harrington
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much the chair now
 
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:12.780 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative McGee for a
 
01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:13.790 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative McGee for a
question

01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
um in listening to other folks speak
 
01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
about their specific issues around
 
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
demand charges I'm reminded of a
 
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
conversation that I had with uh Hollis
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
primary school they invested in solar
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
panels on the roof uh to lower their
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
their costs uh for them McGee could you
 
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
suspend for a moment sure could you
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
um possibly get a little bit closer to
 
01:26:41.209 --> 01:26:41.219 align:start position:0%
your microphone because it's very hard
 
01:26:43.129 --> 01:26:43.139 align:start position:0%
for us to hear you thank you I
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that no problem I usually
 
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
project pretty loud so
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
I was just our our primary school system
 
01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
has invested in solar panels as many
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
school systems have to try and lower uh
 
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
their fixed costs and they were among
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
the first people to mention to me the
 
01:27:07.129 --> 01:27:07.139 align:start position:0%
idea of the peak demand charges being
 
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
something they had not anticipated
 
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
because Peak charges from their
 
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
perspective are middle of the day and as
 
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh as a school system they can't avoid
 
01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
um being affected by those Peak demand
 
01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
charges and so they have not realized
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
the savings that they hoped for and it's
 
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
all just policy so I I I wanted to see
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
if Ms minnow could could talk about that
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
the time of use and how that affects
 
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
various users in the system because I I
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
can't say that I fully understand why
 
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
the schools are um are uh in this
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
situation where they can't realize uh
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
the benefits that they had hoped to by
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
that investment in local energy
 
01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct so with their solar
 
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing they're net metering and
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
demand charges are never credited to net
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
metering customers and so that's not
 
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
something that when you export you can
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
reduce your your demand charge so
 
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
um with solar the amount of solar that
 
01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
you're using in real time behind the
 
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
meter can help you lower your demand
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
charge but that can be difficult to
 
01:28:15.649 --> 01:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
predict when you're developing a system
 
01:28:18.649 --> 01:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
for a specific application how much will
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
be used at a very fine scale time
 
01:28:23.149 --> 01:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
increment in real time behind the meter
 
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
versus being exported to the grid so
 
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
that does affect those situations and
 
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
what you were talking about
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
time of day there are more sophisticated
 
01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
demand charges that are called Peak
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
coincident demand charges because really
 
01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
demand charges are meant to
 
01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:41.689 align:start position:0%
demand charges are meant to
um

01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
allow utilities to recover the cost of
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
serving very high draw customers but as
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
you all have probably heard many times
 
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
Peak demand times is when most of the
 
01:28:59.930 --> 01:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
grid costs are created and so if a high
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
draw demand customer their Peak always
 
01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
happens at night time when Demand on the
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
overall grid is actually quite low the
 
01:29:09.649 --> 01:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
cost of serving that customer is
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
exaggerated by their demand charge
 
01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
because we use blunt demand charges
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter when your Peak is
 
01:29:18.290 --> 01:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
happening we're going to charge you
 
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
based on how high that Peak is and so
 
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
really there are more sophisticated
 
01:29:25.129 --> 01:29:25.139 align:start position:0%
demand charges which are called Peak
 
01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
coincident demand charges
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair can I just have a
 
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
follow I just yes follow up
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
so Ms minnow then again I'm assuming the
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
complexities here are are significant so
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that's why you're
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
yes correct I mean there's a lot of
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
complexity here and as as I mentioned
 
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh very important clean
 
01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
energy sectors that are very uh very
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
affected by demand charges like electric
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle charging as um DC fast charging
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
stations are very high draw however
 
01:30:06.649 --> 01:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
um at at low U usage rates
 
01:30:08.689 --> 01:30:08.699 align:start position:0%
um the cost of running those stations
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
can be so high because if a car charges
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
there once a month you're going to be
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
paying so much for that demand charge
 
01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
compared to the electricity used that it
 
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
completely destroys the economics of
 
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
developing a DC fast charging Network
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair recognizes
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham for a question
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman I I very
 
01:30:37.129 --> 01:30:37.139 align:start position:0%
much appreciate you bringing forward the
 
01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
issue of the complexity of this uh on on
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
on on first glance it makes so much
 
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
sense to I mean get rid of these demand
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
charges what what's the purpose there
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
are a lot of reasons for them and if we
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
eliminate them those charges are going
 
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
to be put somewhere else those charges
 
01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:56.219 align:start position:0%
aren't going to go away they're going to
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
be reallocated and it if we
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
I believe and I could be wrong here
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
because I'm really not as up on
 
01:31:06.169 --> 01:31:06.179 align:start position:0%
Commercial and Industrial rate design as
 
01:31:09.169 --> 01:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
I am on residential design but I very
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
much fear that this could lead to
 
01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
increased rates for our residential rate
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
payers so I I support the the idea
 
01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.149 align:start position:0%
payers so I I support the the idea
um

01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for bringing up the
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
complexity of this because it's
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
important in our willingness and
 
01:31:29.689 --> 01:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
Readiness to go forward with a study
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
committee was there a question there
 
01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham I started with a
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
question and then I realized that it
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
didn't make any sense so I'm I just I
 
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
can say that generally the costs are
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
shifted to volumetric charges and so it
 
01:31:47.810 --> 01:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
is more reflective of how much energy
 
01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
you're using
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
in general
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Kelly
 
01:31:59.450 --> 01:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
luckily I remember to get dressed uh you
 
01:32:10.729 --> 01:32:10.739 align:start position:0%
asked for some additional
 
01:32:10.739 --> 01:32:11.930 align:start position:0%
asked for some additional
um

01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
things to be included in this
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I just wondered
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
you you talked about battery charging
 
01:32:23.689 --> 01:32:23.699 align:start position:0%
which I was I'm going to assume it's
 
01:32:23.699 --> 01:32:24.830 align:start position:0%
which I was I'm going to assume it's
cars

01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
cars
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
what about storage batteries
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
um that are now coming online
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh being becoming more effective would
 
01:32:37.370 --> 01:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
it affect storage batteries in
 
01:32:41.209 --> 01:32:41.219 align:start position:0%
residential and in commercial uses
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
the demand charge that's correct I
 
01:32:45.169 --> 01:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
talked about both electric vehicle
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
charging and energy storage battery
 
01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
charging and in New Hampshire thankfully
 
01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
residential customers are not charge
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
demand charges so battery charging in
 
01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
the residential application would not be
 
01:32:59.410 --> 01:32:59.420 align:start position:0%
affected by demand charges however
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
larger energy store battery energy
 
01:33:04.129 --> 01:33:04.139 align:start position:0%
storage installations that would
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
interconnect to the grid would likely be
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
put on a commercial industrial tariff
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
which would have a demand charge and as
 
01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
I explained in my written testimony
 
01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
these batteries specifically operate to
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
charge at low load low-cost times and
 
01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:22.460 align:start position:0%
discharge at Peak demand high cost times
 
01:33:25.610 --> 01:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
and so for them for example a peak
 
01:33:27.169 --> 01:33:27.179 align:start position:0%
coincident demand charge would make a
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
lot more sense because
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
by definition they are operating to only
 
01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
charge at off-peak low-cost times
 
01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you you need a follow-up
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
Representative no I do not thank you
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
you have no more
 
01:33:49.129 --> 01:33:49.139 align:start position:0%
raised hands so I would like to ask if
 
01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
there are any members or any persons who
 
01:33:55.490 --> 01:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
want to speak who have not been so
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
recognized who
 
01:34:00.169 --> 01:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
recognize yourself your desire right at
 
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
see none I will close this public
 
01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
hearing whoops
 
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
I see that Krista shoots has has to be
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
recognized so Chris to shoot
 
01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
you will be uh permitted to speak go
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
ahead please
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
thanks very much this is Krista shoot on
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
behalf of the office of the consumer
 
01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:30.290 align:start position:0%
behalf of the office of the consumer
Advocate

01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
Advocate
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
um Mr crease had submitted some
 
01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
testimony and I just wanted to follow up
 
01:34:39.129 --> 01:34:39.139 align:start position:0%
on the comment
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
in regards to uh
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
so Mr crease's testimony
 
01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
um asks for an amendment for the repair
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
Advocate to be represented on the board
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to point out that though
 
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
residential ratepayers don't currently
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
pay demand charges there is both the
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
potential for an impact from changes but
 
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
also because of batteries and EV the
 
01:35:15.129 --> 01:35:15.139 align:start position:0%
potential for ratepayers to start paying
 
01:35:19.129 --> 01:35:19.139 align:start position:0%
those in the future and so that is part
 
01:35:22.729 --> 01:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
of the reason that we are interested in
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
supporting the committee and being on on
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
the committee and also to make myself
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
available for questions if anyone has
 
01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:32.410 align:start position:0%
available for questions if anyone has
any

01:35:32.410 --> 01:35:32.420 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
shoot I will remind everyone that at the
 
01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
direction of the speaker of the house we
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
have been requested to retain all study
 
01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
committee and study commission bills so
 
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
there will be adequate time to make
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
adjustments to this bill
 
01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh when we take it up in the fall
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
I'll just remind everyone of that
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
and I will now recognize recuperating
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
member of the
 
01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:01.550 align:start position:0%
member of the
stne

01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
stne
 
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
Fred Platt for a comment go ahead
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative play
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say hello
 
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
um it's back to be good to be back in
 
01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
the saddle I want to thank all of my
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
friends at the at stne who said cards
 
01:36:20.450 --> 01:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
and otherwise uh contacted me including
 
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh rep cap McKee who forgot to put my
 
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
name on the card so they had to open it
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
up to find out who it's for but thank
 
01:36:29.649 --> 01:36:29.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.729 --> 01:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
and it's great to have you back
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative but uh we'll monitor your
 
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
recuperation and we'll welcome you back
 
01:36:39.229 --> 01:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
to the committee as a full participating
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
member as soon as you're able
 
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:48.050 align:start position:0%
member as soon as you're able
um

01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.209 --> 01:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
Troy Marner wants you back soon as it
 
01:36:52.209 --> 01:36:52.219 align:start position:0%
turns out
 
01:36:55.129 --> 01:36:55.139 align:start position:0%
so representative oxenham did you have
 
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
yes I do
 
01:37:02.570 --> 01:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
um be nice to ask you a question thank
 
01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
you very much it has to do with this
 
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
issue of whether or not we can have
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
study committees and study commissions
 
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
at our at a previous meeting you told us
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
that the president of the senate had
 
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
directed that bills would be itl'd when
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
they reached the Senate if they were
 
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
passed out of the house with a component
 
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
of a study committee or a study
 
01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
Commission Now this morning you're
 
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
telling us it's the direction of the
 
01:37:29.209 --> 01:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house I spent a great
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
deal of time tracking down this issue of
 
01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
the president of the Senate because I
 
01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
have several bills for very good reasons
 
01:37:38.209 --> 01:37:38.219 align:start position:0%
that contain study committees and study
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
commissions I'm very concerned about
 
01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:42.659 align:start position:0%
this issue so it could could you
 
01:37:45.649 --> 01:37:45.659 align:start position:0%
elaborate please for us where it's
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
coming from whether it applies to every
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh just the ramifications of
 
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
this are really quite quite important a
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
lot of the legislation that we receive
 
01:38:00.649 --> 01:38:00.659 align:start position:0%
requires more substantive consideration
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
and thought than we can give it
 
01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
particularly with these truncated
 
01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
compressed time periods were allocated
 
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
okay I understand your question I'll do
 
01:38:11.810 --> 01:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
my best to answer it
 
01:38:15.050 --> 01:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
the way it was explained to members of
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
house leadership
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
was that the president of the Senate
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Chuck Morris
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
approached the speaker of the house and
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
informed him that if the house sent to
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
the Senate and he studied committee or
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
study commission bills that they would
 
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
be itl'd
 
01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house then informed
 
01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:39.020 align:start position:0%
house leadership which included
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
obviously the chairs of house committees
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the best strategy to use for study
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
committee and study commission bills
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
would be to retain them
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
because if you pass them they'll just be
 
01:38:55.010 --> 01:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
itl in the Senate
 
01:38:57.290 --> 01:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
so that's my understanding of the
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
progression of the communication between
 
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
the leadership of the Senate and the
 
01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
leadership of the house
 
01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
so with that uh
 
01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize
 
01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Pitts for a
 
01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:14.330 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Pitts for a
question

01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.689 --> 01:39:20.699 align:start position:0%
are we permitted to work on it over the
 
01:39:20.699 --> 01:39:21.709 align:start position:0%
are we permitted to work on it over the
summer

01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
as as we have in subcommittees or after
 
01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
committee work or when we are not inside
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
when we are not meeting
 
01:39:34.850 --> 01:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
yes the answer to that question is yes
 
01:39:36.649 --> 01:39:36.659 align:start position:0%
typically you do it in the fall but I
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
suppose we could do it in the summer
 
01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
although you wouldn't be allowed to
 
01:39:42.110 --> 01:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
collect any mileage for going to a
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting in the summer but
 
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm not collecting mileage for this
 
01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:56.649 align:start position:0%
um I'm not collecting mileage for this
one

01:39:56.649 --> 01:39:56.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.010 --> 01:40:00.020 align:start position:0%
all right representative Thomas
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
if I may just add to the explanation for
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding is if the bill is
 
01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.390 align:start position:0%
my understanding is if the bill is
retained

01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
on your own you can do work on it
 
01:40:19.729 --> 01:40:19.739 align:start position:0%
during whatever time you have you won't
 
01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
get paid mileage from coming into it to
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
do it because that bill will not be
 
01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:27.500 align:start position:0%
taken up until the next line of the year
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
the other reason for the retaining
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
strategy is plain and simple we don't
 
01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
have a space for the time to give to
 
01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:41.270 align:start position:0%
have a space for the time to give to
subcommittees

01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
to around the Committees to to meet
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
with our situation with the pandemic and
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
the and the limitations we have
 
01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
leaderships of both house felt that on
 
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
both sides felt that we you opened up
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
for one we have it open up for everyone
 
01:41:00.050 --> 01:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
and there's no space to put these
 
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
committees so that was part of the other
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
garage sale or or you know for the
 
01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
reasoning so it wasn't just an arbitrary
 
01:41:10.129 --> 01:41:10.139 align:start position:0%
decision it was it was reason for it
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
that's their reason that's their
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
rational board that's what we've been
 
01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
instructed to do and do
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Thomas this is
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
not an issue for a debate so I will
 
01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
recognize representative McGee for a
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
question but only a question we're not
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
going to debate this issue
 
01:41:33.530 --> 01:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to debate the issue
 
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
um my question is I was looking at
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
Senate bills the other day and I noticed
 
01:41:40.490 --> 01:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
that they have an awful lot of study
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
committees and I'm wondering if the
 
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
house is going to take the same position
 
01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:47.699 align:start position:0%
that the Senate has taken because they
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
actually have a lot of their work in
 
01:41:52.129 --> 01:41:52.139 align:start position:0%
study commissions as well so I'm just
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
curious because
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
um they a lot of the bills that they put
 
01:41:57.709 --> 01:41:57.719 align:start position:0%
forward are also committees and
 
01:41:57.719 --> 01:41:58.970 align:start position:0%
forward are also committees and
commissions

01:41:58.970 --> 01:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
I can't comment on how the Senate
 
01:42:04.129 --> 01:42:04.139 align:start position:0%
conducts their business no no I'm saying
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is the house going to their
 
01:42:07.729 --> 01:42:07.739 align:start position:0%
bills that way if they come over to us
 
01:42:10.609 --> 01:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
if they don't retain their study the way
 
01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
that we're approaching the moment would
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
be that we would receive no study
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
committee bills from the Senate
 
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
okay that they would retain their study
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee bills the same way they've
 
01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
advised us in a few hours okay thank you
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you all right so it
 
01:42:29.629 --> 01:42:29.639 align:start position:0%
appears that we have exhausted the
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
speaker list and the questions for this
 
01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm going to close the public
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.530 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
uh

01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:43.129 --> 01:42:43.139 align:start position:0%
gotta announce the blue sheet I'm sorry
 
01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
our Senate support and zero approvals
 
01:42:53.090 --> 01:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.090 --> 01:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:58.609 --> 01:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
okay so with that we will close the
 
01:43:02.330 --> 01:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB 382.
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
and I will immediately open an exec
 
01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:07.609 align:start position:0%
and I will immediately open an exec
session

01:43:07.609 --> 01:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:11.820 align:start position:0%

yes
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the chair
 
01:47:15.050 --> 01:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
okay the vote is 20 years and one day
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
with a motion to retain passes
 
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
because we're going to retain the bill
 
01:47:26.990 --> 01:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that we do not
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
need a
 
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
majority or Minority Report
 
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
that we just keep the bill in committee
 
01:47:37.609 --> 01:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't go any farther is that
 
01:47:37.619 --> 01:47:41.990 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't go any farther is that
correct

01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.590 --> 01:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh the bill passes and is retained since
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
we have some more time
 
01:47:58.010 --> 01:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on representative
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:10.209 --> 01:48:10.219 align:start position:0%
yes we're going to do another bill
 
01:48:13.490 --> 01:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
well I would like to conclude that we um
 
01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
well I would like to conclude that we um

representative bresney has seconded the
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
motion of Ito on hb80 is there any
 
01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.169 align:start position:0%
motion of Ito on hb80 is there any
discussion

01:48:35.169 --> 01:48:35.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative nodder yes um I had made
 
01:48:42.290 --> 01:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
a call to legislative Services asking
 
01:48:45.470 --> 01:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
for the number of study committees and
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
commissions that we already had finally
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
came in this morning well I didn't have
 
01:48:52.970 --> 01:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
time to read through them all but it's a
 
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
very very long list and all of these
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
commissions and studies add up it costs
 
01:48:59.689 --> 01:48:59.699 align:start position:0%
money and I know it all it's only a
 
01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
little bit of money here a little bit of
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
money there but it all adds up to a lot
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
of money and we've we just have too many
 
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these things can be studied
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
without having to to meet we're talking
 
01:49:12.290 --> 01:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
about HB 80 which is not a study
 
01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:15.290 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:17.109 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
where are all these study committees
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
that we're going through
 
01:49:20.639 --> 01:49:21.770 align:start position:0%
that we're going through
um

01:49:21.770 --> 01:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:24.370 --> 01:49:24.380 align:start position:0%
all the Energy Efficiency but okay
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
Reggie yes subsidies I everyone knows I
 
01:49:30.290 --> 01:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
have an issue with with the subsidies
 
01:49:33.770 --> 01:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
and taxes and it I know it's only a
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
little bit so again this also applies a
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
little bit here a little bit there it
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
all adds up and the only way to reduce
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
taxes is to chip away a little bit at a
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
time so for that and uh also so I don't
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
have to speak again when we get to the
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
studies we'll start even soon don't have
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
to talk again
 
01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:53.990 align:start position:0%
to talk again
representative

representative
 
01:49:56.930 --> 01:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
are there other representatives in the
 
01:49:59.090 --> 01:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
room that would like to express an
 
01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:00.770 align:start position:0%
room that would like to express an
opinion

01:50:00.770 --> 01:50:00.780 align:start position:0%

oh this is John Mann I would like to oh

01:50:13.729 --> 01:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
I don't see your hand raised uh I don't
 
01:50:16.129 --> 01:50:16.139 align:start position:0%
know how to raise my hand I'm just so I
 
01:50:19.010 --> 01:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
used my voice
 
01:50:21.229 --> 01:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
if you want me to wave or is there a
 
01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
button there's a little button on the
 
01:50:26.330 --> 01:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
bottom of the secret
 
01:50:30.910 --> 01:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.290 --> 01:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative man or anybody else on
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
Zoom I'm going to recognize
 
01:50:38.450 --> 01:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
representative Amala for a comment yes
 
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
um the comment I wanted to make is in a
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
lot of the testimony and discussion and
 
01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
the questions that we had on this bill
 
01:50:46.729 --> 01:50:46.739 align:start position:0%
my concern is that we talked about
 
01:50:48.770 --> 01:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency which which everyone
 
01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:50.820 align:start position:0%
agrees with Energy Efficiency things are
 
01:50:52.729 --> 01:50:52.739 align:start position:0%
great but that wasn't the focus of the
 
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
bill the focus of this bill is that this
 
01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
will take away money out of the answer
 
01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:57.709 align:start position:0%
will take away money out of the answer
space

01:50:57.709 --> 01:50:57.719 align:start position:0%
space
 
01:51:00.649 --> 01:51:00.659 align:start position:0%
residents can now let all residents can
 
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
now equally participate in it and things
 
01:51:07.490 --> 01:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
like the two years ago they offered four
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for insulation and that
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
was right off the top of your program so
 
01:51:13.870 --> 01:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
if a homeowner had a six thousand dollar
 
01:51:16.609 --> 01:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
insulation Project New Hampshire State
 
01:51:18.649 --> 01:51:18.659 align:start position:0%
took four uh four thousand right off
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
that last year that was actually
 
01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
increased to about 8 000.
 
01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
um so those things are really important
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
and and those things just to say that
 
01:51:29.209 --> 01:51:29.219 align:start position:0%
unless this money gets shifted we're not
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
doing energy efficiencies inaccurate
 
01:51:34.250 --> 01:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
because we actually are and homeowners
 
01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
now have the choice to do the projects
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
that that work best for them and so my
 
01:51:41.689 --> 01:51:41.699 align:start position:0%
concern is by taking that away that's
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
actually a very big savings to
 
01:51:46.370 --> 01:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
homeowners and it allows them uh people
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
that just aren't in low incomes with
 
01:51:50.330 --> 01:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
just the level of incomes it allows them
 
01:51:51.890 --> 01:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
to do some pretty amazing things to
 
01:51:53.330 --> 01:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
their home so that's my concern about
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I would just
 
01:52:08.689 --> 01:52:08.699 align:start position:0%
like to say uh that uh there is nobody
 
01:52:10.609 --> 01:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
taking away any money from New Hampshire
 
01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:12.659 align:start position:0%
saves I think we've heard the testimony
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
from Mr Fitzgerald that this this bill
 
01:52:19.070 --> 01:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
actually gives New Hampshire saves more
 
01:52:22.250 --> 01:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
money and will provide more help to the
 
01:52:24.649 --> 01:52:24.659 align:start position:0%
very cases that were just mentioned as
 
01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
needing more funding so uh all the
 
01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
testimony we've heard on this bill has
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
been saying that this is a very useful
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
and very good bill both for the
 
01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
ratepayers as well as for the State of
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I think we should go
 
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
ahead and improve it thank you
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McWilliams
 
01:52:48.410 --> 01:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Bose I just wanted to
 
01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
reiterate that from the uh sign-ins that
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
we received on this bill there were 23
 
01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
in support and two neutral we have not
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
heard any testimony against this bill so
 
01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised that the first motion that
 
01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
was brought up was an itl that's all I
 
01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
have to say about this thank you
 
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
yes as I'm looking out the window and
 
01:53:15.410 --> 01:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
the wind is picking up I don't think
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
there's anybody in the state of New
 
01:53:20.090 --> 01:53:20.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that would not give up a price
 
01:53:22.490 --> 01:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
of a cup of coffee and a muffin at
 
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
Starbucks to provide five million
 
01:53:30.290 --> 01:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
dollars more in insulation and Energy
 
01:53:33.649 --> 01:53:33.659 align:start position:0%
Efficiency for for the rest of the state
 
01:53:35.689 --> 01:53:35.699 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you representative
 
01:53:35.699 --> 01:53:42.890 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you representative
Harrington

01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:46.729 --> 01:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
uh never mind it's not necessary
 
01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
uh representative oxenham
 
01:53:53.450 --> 01:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much I I want to do
 
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh mention the exact figures that uh
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
Mike Fitzgerald gave us currently New
 
01:54:02.810 --> 01:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves is getting 2.9 Million
 
01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:03.770 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves is getting 2.9 Million
Dollars

01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
Dollars
 
01:54:08.410 --> 01:54:08.420 align:start position:0%
this bill would raise that to 6.7
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars so in in the interest of
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know absolute Clarity here what
 
01:54:18.649 --> 01:54:18.659 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is is taking away
 
01:54:21.250 --> 01:54:21.260 align:start position:0%
that one equivalent of a dollar a month
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
from the bill that people don't even
 
01:54:26.410 --> 01:54:26.420 align:start position:0%
notice is there
 
01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
aggregating that money into a pool from
 
01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
which people competitively are chosen
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
for their projects
 
01:54:37.729 --> 01:54:37.739 align:start position:0%
and we we get the most cost effective
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
use of that money and another speaker
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
said in in general for every one dollar
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
we spend on Energy Efficiency we have a
 
01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
four dollar gain so they all have to
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
pass cost benefit analysis this is a
 
01:54:55.609 --> 01:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
very good use of our money we should not
 
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
be walking away from Energy Efficiency
 
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
it's the best thing we can do for air
 
01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
pollution greenhouse gas emissions
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
lowering demand lowering our prices
 
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
across the board thank you
 
01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I saw as a new legislator I'll be
 
01:55:18.649 --> 01:55:18.659 align:start position:0%
very uncomfortable in having to explain
 
01:55:20.930 --> 01:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
to my constituents why I'm not doing
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
everything in my power to reduce
 
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
property taxes reducing our school
 
01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:27.169 align:start position:0%
property taxes reducing our school
expenses

01:55:27.169 --> 01:55:27.179 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
I am all in favor of this bill
 
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank the representative Mann
 
01:55:36.169 --> 01:55:36.179 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you
 
01:55:36.179 --> 01:55:37.669 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you
um

01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
I just think after all the testimony
 
01:55:42.890 --> 01:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
that was given in favor of the bill
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to repeat myself but I
 
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
cannot believe anybody would even think
 
01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
about it yelling it thank you
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Thomas
 
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh you know
 
01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
this is very indicative of
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
in many ways in government knows best
 
01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
and I would like to say that we could
 
01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
take more money out of people's
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
paychecks for child programs for
 
01:56:13.010 --> 01:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for anything we wanted
 
01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
and say that it benefits everybody and
 
01:56:17.629 --> 01:56:17.639 align:start position:0%
yet we're just making money more away
 
01:56:22.189 --> 01:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
from people I would suggest that instead
 
01:56:25.250 --> 01:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
of sending out the message that we don't
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
care about our business repairs we're
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
going to take all that money and give it
 
01:56:31.010 --> 01:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
to where we think it works best I
 
01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that we keep
 
01:56:36.410 --> 01:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
a some type of a proportion to at least
 
01:56:40.129 --> 01:56:40.139 align:start position:0%
sell repairs we understand your plight
 
01:56:43.370 --> 01:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
and we you know like to take some but
 
01:56:45.649 --> 01:56:45.659 align:start position:0%
not all of your money to do some
 
01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
programs not take it all so I'm getting
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
a little tired of people saying it's
 
01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
only going to cost a cup of coffee you
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
add up Taylor's programs it becomes the
 
01:56:59.570 --> 01:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
cost of a you know maybe a meal so I
 
01:57:02.090 --> 01:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
suggest that we keep the program the way
 
01:57:05.570 --> 01:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
it is uh would be in favor of IPL and at
 
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
least we show some support for the
 
01:57:09.070 --> 01:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
residential repairs and we understand
 
01:57:11.930 --> 01:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
that it will take so many money but we
 
01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
don't take it all all the time so that's
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
the way I feel about that
 
01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman I've heard two
 
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
Representatives talk about saving money
 
01:57:29.629 --> 01:57:29.639 align:start position:0%
on taxes this has nothing to do with
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
taxes this has to do with Energy
 
01:57:34.490 --> 01:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and let's face it taxes never
 
01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
go down they always go up they never go
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
down in my history I've never seen taxes
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
go down so this is about Energy
 
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
Efficiency thank you Mr chairman
 
01:57:46.490 --> 01:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you representative
 
01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:51.890 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you representative
representative

01:57:51.890 --> 01:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.890 --> 01:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
taxes because you can't they're going to
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
spend it all and ask for more because
 
01:57:59.930 --> 01:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
hashtag Never Enough redistribution of
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:09.970 --> 01:58:09.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:15.649 --> 01:58:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.890 --> 01:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
sorry Mr chairman thank you Mr chairman
 
01:58:21.770 --> 01:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to save people money
 
01:58:23.169 --> 01:58:23.179 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:58:25.729 --> 01:58:25.739 align:start position:0%
deserves our vote
 
01:58:28.970 --> 01:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
we should we should vote no on itl in
 
01:58:30.950 --> 01:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
this bill so that we can take a new
 
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
motion thank you
 
01:58:37.129 --> 01:58:37.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
our representative Bernardi thank you Mr
 
01:58:43.609 --> 01:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
chairman for that so as I've listened to
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
the testimony going back and forth It's
 
01:58:49.609 --> 01:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
always this Energy Efficiency is going
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
to save us money it's going to say the
 
01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
very very very very small number of
 
01:58:59.089 --> 01:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
people some money because they're going
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
to be the benefit Fisheries of the
 
01:59:05.149 --> 01:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency projects it's going to
 
01:59:08.990 --> 01:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
take money from 450
 
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.550 align:start position:0%
take money from 450
000

01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.370 --> 01:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
so it's a balancing question here and
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's not as has been characterized this
 
01:59:22.609 --> 01:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
is a great Boon to Energy Efficiency
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's a very selected population that
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
will benefit everybody else will suffer
 
01:59:32.689 --> 01:59:32.699 align:start position:0%
thank you I would remind the members in
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
the room to speak loudly and clearly
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative Presley thank you Mr
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
chairman during the initial testimony I
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
heard that rate payers are are not going
 
01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
to save are not benefiting from the
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
small amount that they're saving and
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
that they would benefit a lot more if
 
01:59:51.890 --> 01:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
they were to invest in energy efficient
 
01:59:53.330 --> 01:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
light bulbs
 
01:59:56.330 --> 01:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
um but the the price for an energy
 
01:59:58.490 --> 01:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
efficient light bulb is significantly
 
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
covered by these rebates so if you were
 
02:00:04.129 --> 02:00:04.139 align:start position:0%
to to continue the rebates right payers
 
02:00:05.930 --> 02:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
can use that money to buy energy
 
02:00:07.729 --> 02:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
efficient light bulbs and lower their
 
02:00:07.739 --> 02:00:09.890 align:start position:0%
efficient light bulbs and lower their
bills

02:00:09.890 --> 02:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you it appears that everyone now
 
02:00:15.290 --> 02:00:15.300 align:start position:0%
has had a chance to stream everything
 
02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:18.470 align:start position:0%
has had a chance to stream everything
period

02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:20.209 --> 02:00:20.219 align:start position:0%
excuse me that I hear someone say
 
02:00:22.129 --> 02:00:22.139 align:start position:0%
something yeah it was representative
 
02:00:22.139 --> 02:00:26.350 align:start position:0%
something yeah it was representative
McGee

02:00:26.350 --> 02:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:28.609 --> 02:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
no go ahead
 
02:00:31.070 --> 02:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
um I I've heard a whole bunch of
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
different positions here but
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
um the itl motion from my fellow
 
02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative from district
 
02:00:43.370 --> 02:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough 27
 
02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:44.229 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough 27
um

02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:46.609 --> 02:00:46.619 align:start position:0%
stated the that the bill does the
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
opposite of what it does and if that is
 
02:00:52.189 --> 02:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
the basis for the itl I I think
 
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
we need a clear understanding if there's
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a motion to um make this
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
bill inexpedient to legislate and that's
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
going to be the recommendation of why
 
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
it's being proposed that way because
 
02:01:07.010 --> 02:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
this bill would support increased
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
funding for Energy Efficiency which does
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
lower rates for everyone because it
 
02:01:16.609 --> 02:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
lowers our Demand right it it lowers the
 
02:01:18.290 --> 02:01:18.300 align:start position:0%
amount of energy that we're required to
 
02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
purchase and so in my town in our town
 
02:01:23.810 --> 02:01:23.820 align:start position:0%
in suhimolas and my town we have that
 
02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
school that is looking to figure out how
 
02:01:27.890 --> 02:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
to make their investments in locally
 
02:01:29.930 --> 02:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
generated energy on the school buildings
 
02:01:31.729 --> 02:01:31.739 align:start position:0%
work for them
 
02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
and those investments in Energy
 
02:01:36.290 --> 02:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
Efficiency are forever
 
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
it means that that those are the
 
02:01:41.450 --> 02:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
negawatts that that consumer Advocate
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
Chris spoke about which means we don't
 
02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:45.179 align:start position:0%
have to pay for that energy anymore
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
because once the efficiency is in place
 
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
they don't use as much energy
 
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
so this idea that it it it's somehow
 
02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:54.050 align:start position:0%
so this idea that it it it's somehow
being

02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
um transferred to rate payers as a cost
 
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
they will pick up that's not true that's
 
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
why we're advocating for the bill
 
02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
because the bill
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
supports lowered energy costs so you can
 
02:02:09.770 --> 02:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
look at it as property taxes that
 
02:02:12.290 --> 02:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
municipalities have to pay because their
 
02:02:13.970 --> 02:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
energy costs are going up and not down
 
02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
but this is one way you can bring those
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
energy costs down and that's the reason
 
02:02:21.709 --> 02:02:21.719 align:start position:0%
it's being proposed so when it's being
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
presented here is this that and the
 
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
other is a study committee and none of
 
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
those are relevant to what we heard in
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
the testimonies today so I would really
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
ask that people on this committee look
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
at it for the benefits that it's going
 
02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
to bring to New Hampshire and not from
 
02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
an ideology ideological standpoint
 
02:02:41.689 --> 02:02:41.699 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative McGee representative
 
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
omila did you want to respond yes sir
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
all I was saying was that my statement
 
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
wasn't the basis for an itl I did not
 
02:02:55.370 --> 02:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
mention Ito one of the things that I was
 
02:02:56.990 --> 02:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
just trying to bring up was the fact
 
02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
that reducing if we reduce if this
 
02:03:02.209 --> 02:03:02.219 align:start position:0%
affects in any way and the question I
 
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
had originally was does this change the
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Sage program the answer I
 
02:03:08.209 --> 02:03:08.219 align:start position:0%
received in testimony was yes and so my
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
my point just went to
 
02:03:12.890 --> 02:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
why are we why would we want to reduce
 
02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire stage program because
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
it is still accomplishing what we wanted
 
02:03:19.609 --> 02:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
to accomplish for Energy Efficiency I
 
02:03:21.770 --> 02:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify that thank you and
 
02:03:24.290 --> 02:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
the response was that it increases the
 
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire saves program it does not
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
reduce it okay thank you representative
 
02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:30.410 align:start position:0%

intersection with a four-way stop
 
02:10:24.589 --> 02:10:24.599 align:start position:0%
there's another double pole there and
 
02:10:26.689 --> 02:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
you have to go around it to get to the
 
02:10:26.699 --> 02:10:30.709 align:start position:0%
you have to go around it to get to the
crosswalk

02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:32.810 --> 02:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
across the walk there's another car
 
02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
coming into the intersection
 
02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:37.070 align:start position:0%
coming into the intersection
and

02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
and as you proceed from behind the
 
02:10:42.890 --> 02:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
double pole the driver doesn't see you
 
02:10:45.129 --> 02:10:45.139 align:start position:0%
and you may not see them
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:52.970 --> 02:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
other safety concerns with the city are
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
that double poles are usually there to
 
02:10:58.490 --> 02:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
rep to replace the damaged pole either
 
02:11:02.209 --> 02:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
from an auto accident or from
 
02:11:04.129 --> 02:11:04.139 align:start position:0%
um natural causes
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
these polls are lashed together and you
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
never know when
 
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
the the pole that has been left for
 
02:11:14.810 --> 02:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
utilities to remove their equipment
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
um May collapse or parts may fall on
 
02:11:18.239 --> 02:11:19.189 align:start position:0%
um May collapse or parts may fall on
someone

02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
someone
 
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
in the community
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
a challenge we've had has been has been
 
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
told to us from the public works
 
02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:26.870 align:start position:0%
told to us from the public works
department

02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:11:29.410 --> 02:11:29.420 align:start position:0%
is that a damaged Pole
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
make it many of its power components
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
replaced immediately when the poll is
 
02:11:37.089 --> 02:11:37.099 align:start position:0%
replaced however all of the other
 
02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
utilities that utilize that poll and
 
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
have been notified of poll is replaced
 
02:11:44.570 --> 02:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
then we'll have to schedule time with
 
02:11:47.810 --> 02:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
the city to replace their
 
02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
their hardware and their cables and all
 
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:11:53.570 --> 02:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
the challenge is that many of these
 
02:11:57.410 --> 02:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
utilities don't replace or their
 
02:12:00.189 --> 02:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
equipment or move their equipment for
 
02:12:03.470 --> 02:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
weeks months or even years
 
02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
and we have many polls in the city that
 
02:12:08.089 --> 02:12:08.099 align:start position:0%
are in this condition
 
02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
these um these poles detract from the
 
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
the character of our communities
 
02:12:17.149 --> 02:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
they put our
 
02:12:19.609 --> 02:12:19.619 align:start position:0%
residents at risk
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
they also put property values at risk
 
02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:25.010 align:start position:0%
they also put property values at risk
when

02:12:25.010 --> 02:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:30.169 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:12:30.169 --> 02:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:30.179 --> 02:12:30.830 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:12:30.830 --> 02:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:34.370 --> 02:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
so I support adding a commission to take
 
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
a look at this because last year a house
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:44.209 --> 02:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
um was supposed to take a look at this
 
02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
particular issue
 
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
and as I attended a work session on it
 
02:12:51.649 --> 02:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
it was determined that there was no
 
02:12:51.659 --> 02:12:53.229 align:start position:0%
it was determined that there was no
formal

02:12:53.229 --> 02:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
formal
 
02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
ability for all of our utilities to
 
02:12:58.790 --> 02:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
coordinate to move all of their
 
02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
equipment onto a new coal and it was
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
recommended at that time that we formed
 
02:13:06.410 --> 02:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
some form of commission so that all the
 
02:13:09.050 --> 02:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
parties could get together and work out
 
02:13:13.729 --> 02:13:13.739 align:start position:0%
an arrangement for how we do this in a
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
coordinated fashion so that cities
 
02:13:19.550 --> 02:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
weren't left with what some utility just
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
sort of ignores
 
02:13:24.890 --> 02:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
and so I would I voted I would vote in
 
02:13:26.930 --> 02:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
support of this bill so we can extend
 
02:13:29.629 --> 02:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
establish a commission to look into how
 
02:13:32.089 --> 02:13:32.099 align:start position:0%
these utilities will work together to
 
02:13:35.569 --> 02:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
provide our our residents uh with the
 
02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
safety they they deserve as well as the
 
02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:39.970 align:start position:0%
safety they they deserve as well as the
city

02:13:39.970 --> 02:13:39.980 align:start position:0%
city
 
02:13:42.770 --> 02:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to call on a regular
 
02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
basis to see if somebody is going to
 
02:13:47.149 --> 02:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
repair it and remove their equipment
 
02:13:50.689 --> 02:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:54.830 --> 02:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:59.589 --> 02:13:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.930 --> 02:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
before we move to questions
 
02:14:07.970 --> 02:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
I see that Jackie Grote is now here and
 
02:14:12.350 --> 02:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
has her hand raised
 
02:14:15.050 --> 02:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
and would like to to speak
 
02:14:17.089 --> 02:14:17.099 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to debate should I let her
 
02:14:19.129 --> 02:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
speak before we uh
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
allow other ask questions I I think
 
02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
that that probably is the is the best
 
02:14:27.169 --> 02:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
way to go so I'm going to recognize the
 
02:14:28.970 --> 02:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
chair is now going to recognize Jackie
 
02:14:32.229 --> 02:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
Grote to speak
 
02:14:34.010 --> 02:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:35.930 --> 02:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair and can the committee hear
 
02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:37.490 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair and can the committee hear
me

02:14:37.490 --> 02:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:14:40.129 --> 02:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
yes you're a little bit uh
 
02:14:42.109 --> 02:14:42.119 align:start position:0%
is this better
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
I hear you
 
02:14:46.669 --> 02:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
all right first of all I apologize for
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
my tardiness
 
02:14:52.490 --> 02:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
um and I I wanted to ask you and I want
 
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
to thank representative Thomas for the
 
02:14:57.770 --> 02:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
guidance that he gave to me before this
 
02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
hearing I understand the difficulty of
 
02:15:02.930 --> 02:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
having a commission
 
02:15:06.770 --> 02:15:06.780 align:start position:0%
um did Ms um Martin from the puc speak
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
to you yet she was she had planned on
 
02:15:09.599 --> 02:15:12.350 align:start position:0%
to you yet she was she had planned on
speaking

02:15:12.350 --> 02:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
no she's on the list but we recognize
 
02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
you first okay thank you
 
02:15:17.460 --> 02:15:18.109 align:start position:0%
you first okay thank you
um

02:15:18.109 --> 02:15:18.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:21.770 --> 02:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
so the the conversation that I had with
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas was to try to
 
02:15:27.410 --> 02:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
change this bill from a commission to
 
02:15:30.290 --> 02:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
something that could be more active and
 
02:15:33.709 --> 02:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
perhaps enforce the um
 
02:15:35.810 --> 02:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
the moving of
 
02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:37.669 align:start position:0%
the moving of
these

02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:15:40.430 --> 02:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
um the the moving of the telephone poles
 
02:15:43.729 --> 02:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
and after several phone calls actually
 
02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
with the puc it was determined that this
 
02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
is a complicated issue in that we have
 
02:15:54.649 --> 02:15:54.659 align:start position:0%
telephone pole owners on one hand
 
02:16:00.050 --> 02:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
and um we have uh some of the people on
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
the telephone pole some of the companies
 
02:16:03.530 --> 02:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
on the telephone pole are under the
 
02:16:06.830 --> 02:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the puc such as collect
 
02:16:09.770 --> 02:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
electric companies and then we have some
 
02:16:13.370 --> 02:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
com some carriers that are not under the
 
02:16:15.770 --> 02:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of POC such as cable
 
02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:17.810 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of POC such as cable
companies

02:16:17.810 --> 02:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
companies
 
02:16:22.450 --> 02:16:22.460 align:start position:0%
and so to put together a enforcement
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
RSA would make it difficult without the
 
02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
input from some of the individuals that
 
02:16:32.209 --> 02:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
are not part of the puc the thought was
 
02:16:35.330 --> 02:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
at first to give this the response this
 
02:16:38.509 --> 02:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
gives responsibility to the puc however
 
02:16:41.450 --> 02:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
they don't feel that they can do it
 
02:16:44.330 --> 02:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
as it is because of this component of
 
02:16:47.450 --> 02:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
the cable companies not being part of
 
02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
their jurisdiction
 
02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:51.110 align:start position:0%
their jurisdiction
so

02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:52.730 --> 02:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
um I think it's well recognized that
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
this is a problem throughout New
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the puc is recommending
 
02:17:00.049 --> 02:17:00.059 align:start position:0%
that we go through with the commission
 
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
even though this is a terrible year to
 
02:17:04.730 --> 02:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
do such a thing and I know that the
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
policy has been to reduce or eliminate
 
02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:11.700 align:start position:0%
any commissions so I made it I mean I
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
understand the position I recognize the
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
difficulty and the attempt was made to
 
02:17:20.450 --> 02:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
um give this authority to the puc
 
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
through RSA however they're unable to
 
02:17:25.849 --> 02:17:25.859 align:start position:0%
carry out with their task based on the
 
02:17:27.709 --> 02:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
way it's set up now
 
02:17:29.570 --> 02:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
did it was does anybody have any
 
02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:38.530 --> 02:17:38.540 align:start position:0%
uh representative Thomas has a question
 
02:17:41.690 --> 02:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
representative my question
 
02:17:46.250 --> 02:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the new information uh and
 
02:17:51.169 --> 02:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh I guess my my question would be uh
 
02:17:54.009 --> 02:17:54.019 align:start position:0%
number one I'm in favor of whatever
 
02:17:58.669 --> 02:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
brings this to a fruition uh so are are
 
02:18:00.770 --> 02:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
you um
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
therefore saying that by going forward
 
02:18:06.709 --> 02:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
with a commission that we can expect to
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
perhaps no action for the next at least
 
02:18:13.250 --> 02:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
two years because of the time we have to
 
02:18:15.169 --> 02:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
wait to get to this Mission Bill and
 
02:18:16.849 --> 02:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
then the time for the commission to act
 
02:18:19.129 --> 02:18:19.139 align:start position:0%
and then for the time for whatever they
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
want can actually be put into rules or
 
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
reflect upon so we're looking at maybe
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
two or three years in the future if you
 
02:18:27.049 --> 02:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
personally actually happens is that your
 
02:18:27.059 --> 02:18:28.129 align:start position:0%
personally actually happens is that your
understanding

02:18:28.129 --> 02:18:28.139 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:18:31.310 --> 02:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:33.469 --> 02:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any follow-up
 
02:18:37.009 --> 02:18:37.019 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
okay the chair recognizes representative
 
02:18:39.359 --> 02:18:42.110 align:start position:0%
okay the chair recognizes representative
McWilliams

02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
McWilliams
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you turbos I want to follow up on
 
02:18:48.169 --> 02:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
City and town Authority for charging
 
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
whoever is responsible for these polls
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm curious if there's a way that we
 
02:18:55.610 --> 02:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
can come up with a solution to allow
 
02:18:58.910 --> 02:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
cities and towns to find whoever owns
 
02:19:00.889 --> 02:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
the poll give them that Authority
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
through legislation which I think would
 
02:19:06.650 --> 02:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
then incentivize the owners of the polls
 
02:19:08.929 --> 02:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
to remove them so I'm curious if that's
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
something that has been discussed
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
researched if you have any information
 
02:19:16.669 --> 02:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.370 --> 02:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
oh am I still okay um
 
02:19:23.690 --> 02:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
there are towns that do do that
 
02:19:25.549 --> 02:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
um through their own
 
02:19:30.349 --> 02:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
ordinances but there isn't a Statewide
 
02:19:30.359 --> 02:19:31.129 align:start position:0%
ordinances but there isn't a Statewide
um

02:19:31.129 --> 02:19:31.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:35.450 --> 02:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:37.310 --> 02:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up chervos
 
02:19:39.290 --> 02:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
thanks follow up
 
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so um since you're talking about
 
02:19:44.330 --> 02:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
potential revisions to this legislation
 
02:19:47.570 --> 02:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
might I propose that perhaps a Statewide
 
02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:49.190 align:start position:0%
might I propose that perhaps a Statewide
Authority

02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
um some kind of Statewide statute
 
02:19:53.929 --> 02:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
Authority for cities and towns to find
 
02:19:57.530 --> 02:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
for double polls perhaps
 
02:20:00.530 --> 02:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:09.050 --> 02:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
that was an error I removed my hand but
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
not soon enough
 
02:20:16.250 --> 02:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
oh sorry thank you uh representative
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
Thomas your hand is still up do you need
 
02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
to ask another question
 
02:20:20.100 --> 02:20:21.410 align:start position:0%
to ask another question
okay

02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:20:24.590 --> 02:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh all right there appear to be no
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
further questions the members
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
online are there any questions from
 
02:20:35.389 --> 02:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
see representative brezhny thank you Mr
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
chairman my question is are are do the
 
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
electric companies have liability for
 
02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
what happens with somebody who is
 
02:20:47.389 --> 02:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
injured while trying to go around the
 
02:20:47.399 --> 02:20:50.510 align:start position:0%
injured while trying to go around the
polls

02:20:50.510 --> 02:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
um can you please in what way going
 
02:20:55.490 --> 02:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
around the polls what does that mean
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh like the story that was told earlier
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
with with somebody going around the poll
 
02:21:02.389 --> 02:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
and being hit by a vehicle for example
 
02:21:05.809 --> 02:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
uh okay so this is one of the components
 
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
that the um that I had a conversation
 
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
with the puc on is that safety is an
 
02:21:09.780 --> 02:21:11.030 align:start position:0%
with the puc on is that safety is an
issue

02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:21:12.830 --> 02:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:21:14.450 --> 02:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
to answer
 
02:21:14.460 --> 02:21:15.830 align:start position:0%
to answer
um

02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:19.610 --> 02:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
safety is an issue and the other is that
 
02:21:21.130 --> 02:21:21.140 align:start position:0%
um the the the
 
02:21:24.290 --> 02:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
culprit if I could say that word Loosely
 
02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
in this is not the electric companies
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
um in in every case the electric company
 
02:21:33.710 --> 02:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
because of the the danger involved in
 
02:21:36.530 --> 02:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
moving electrical electrical lines are
 
02:21:38.210 --> 02:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
always the first ones to move their
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
lines from one pole to another that step
 
02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:42.050 align:start position:0%
lines from one pole to another that step
is

02:21:42.050 --> 02:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:21:45.410 --> 02:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
um it goes well and that's the step
 
02:21:48.050 --> 02:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
that's being monitored by the puc
 
02:21:50.210 --> 02:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
step that's not going well and is the
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
issue is the transferring of the cable
 
02:21:57.530 --> 02:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
companies or private security companies
 
02:22:00.050 --> 02:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
that don't have an incentive to move
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
their pull to move one poll to the other
 
02:22:04.849 --> 02:22:04.859 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:22:08.030 --> 02:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
um that is the that's the that's the
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
Crux of the problem how do you
 
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
incentivize those people and safety of a
 
02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
different having two polls and people
 
02:22:16.730 --> 02:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
having to go around them especially in
 
02:22:20.210 --> 02:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:22.670 --> 02:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
I realize that I'm sorry realize that
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
these telephone poles are owned by are
 
02:22:30.730 --> 02:22:30.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:33.469 --> 02:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
any follow-up no thank you okay thank
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
you the chair now recognizes
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:44.330 --> 02:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh representative
 
02:22:46.490 --> 02:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
Grody are
 
02:22:48.650 --> 02:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
02:22:53.690 --> 02:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
allowed to tax the unused polls
 
02:22:56.690 --> 02:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
yes and they do at least I've checked
 
02:23:00.110 --> 02:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.730 --> 02:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:04.670 --> 02:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
any follow-up representative Pimentel
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
no follow-up
 
02:23:09.650 --> 02:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Kelly
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:19.730 --> 02:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
don't forget to turn on your mic
 
02:23:19.740 --> 02:23:23.210 align:start position:0%
don't forget to turn on your mic
representative

02:23:23.210 --> 02:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:26.330 --> 02:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
polls are around some in some areas
 
02:23:27.650 --> 02:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
they're owned by the telephone company
 
02:23:31.130 --> 02:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
in some areas they're owned by the
 
02:23:31.140 --> 02:23:32.330 align:start position:0%
in some areas they're owned by the
um

02:23:32.330 --> 02:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:34.969 --> 02:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
The Electric Company so that's the
 
02:23:34.979 --> 02:23:35.870 align:start position:0%
The Electric Company so that's the
difference

02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:23:39.230 --> 02:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
I know because I used to put polls in
 
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's all I wanted to clarify and I I
 
02:23:45.469 --> 02:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
don't know and I I think one
 
02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you would agree but if
 
02:23:49.730 --> 02:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
there's two poles standing
 
02:23:52.610 --> 02:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
perhaps double taxation on the poll
 
02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:54.590 align:start position:0%
perhaps double taxation on the poll
owner

02:23:54.590 --> 02:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
owner
 
02:23:57.050 --> 02:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
could be could be levied and then there
 
02:23:58.969 --> 02:23:58.979 align:start position:0%
would be some pressure for the others to
 
02:24:01.550 --> 02:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
move their wires
 
02:24:04.849 --> 02:24:04.859 align:start position:0%
that's all this is part of the um so the
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
polls are owned by it's true there are
 
02:24:09.530 --> 02:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
polls that are owned by cable companies
 
02:24:10.969 --> 02:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
and pools that are owned by electric
 
02:24:13.490 --> 02:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
companies but there's several for
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
example the New Hampshire Electric Co-op
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
on some polls eversource owns some polls
 
02:24:21.469 --> 02:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
they're not you know all owned by one
 
02:24:25.010 --> 02:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
entity or another and there is no um
 
02:24:27.170 --> 02:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
this is why we have to have the
 
02:24:29.410 --> 02:24:29.420 align:start position:0%
conversation between these different
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
Services because
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
um there's no enforcement mechanism to
 
02:24:38.570 --> 02:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
move to make one
 
02:24:38.580 --> 02:24:39.590 align:start position:0%
move to make one
um

02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
there's no enforcement mechanism
 
02:24:44.330 --> 02:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
mechanism for example for someone who's
 
02:24:47.809 --> 02:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
getting the tax to make the other person
 
02:24:50.570 --> 02:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
make the other company move their line
 
02:24:52.910 --> 02:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
there's no enforcement mechanism for any
 
02:24:55.610 --> 02:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
of this in New Hampshire which is why
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
we're you know this is why the POC
 
02:25:00.110 --> 02:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
recommended the commission we have to
 
02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
have an understanding in a conversation
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
between many entities before we can move
 
02:25:04.319 --> 02:25:10.969 align:start position:0%
between many entities before we can move
on

02:25:10.969 --> 02:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
do you need a follow-up representative
 
02:25:15.650 --> 02:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
Kelly Pitts no thank you
 
02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
and if I might add although
 
02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
um I know I understand the delay but if
 
02:25:23.630 --> 02:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
the commission was allowed to um do its
 
02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
work then we would have legislation
 
02:25:28.130 --> 02:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
ready in two weeks I mean 22 years as
 
02:25:30.050 --> 02:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
opposed to putting this you know off
 
02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:36.410 --> 02:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair recognizes
 
02:25:40.429 --> 02:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
representative samsich for a question
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:25:44.809 --> 02:25:44.819 align:start position:0%
Mr Brody
 
02:25:47.230 --> 02:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
this is just a comment
 
02:25:50.030 --> 02:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
and I think it's not the highest
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
priority for polls but I would like to
 
02:25:54.969 --> 02:25:54.979 align:start position:0%
point out that this is pretty much
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
Scenic clutter
 
02:25:57.359 --> 02:25:59.210 align:start position:0%
Scenic clutter
absolutely

02:25:59.210 --> 02:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:26:02.510 --> 02:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
it detracts from everything around it so
 
02:26:04.969 --> 02:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
you know maybe shaming people might not
 
02:26:07.790 --> 02:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
be a bad idea
 
02:26:10.929 --> 02:26:10.939 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samsich
 
02:26:13.130 --> 02:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
representative McGee is recognized
 
02:26:13.140 --> 02:26:15.590 align:start position:0%
representative McGee is recognized
requested

02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
requested
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think
 
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
generally is a good idea
 
02:26:22.490 --> 02:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
um my question is actually a little on
 
02:26:25.550 --> 02:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
the process side because
 
02:26:28.730 --> 02:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
um as your uh your testimony opened you
 
02:26:30.349 --> 02:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the fact that commissions
 
02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
and committees are being pushed off and
 
02:26:33.410 --> 02:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
retained and that you might want to
 
02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
bring something more active in terms of
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
not a commission but maybe a fully baked
 
02:26:40.130 --> 02:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill so I'm wondering
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
how you see the disposition of this
 
02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:43.610 align:start position:0%
how you see the disposition of this
going

02:26:43.610 --> 02:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
um because we may be executing it as
 
02:26:47.389 --> 02:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
soon as today so I'm just curious did
 
02:26:49.490 --> 02:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
you plan to have an amendment to this or
 
02:26:51.650 --> 02:26:51.660 align:start position:0%
are you still looking for a committee
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
that may or may not be retained all
 
02:26:55.790 --> 02:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
right the conversation that I had with
 
02:26:58.130 --> 02:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas of your committee
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
was that I should try to bring forth a
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment today which is what I tried to
 
02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
do this week and after conversations
 
02:27:09.170 --> 02:27:09.180 align:start position:0%
with the puc it was decided that we
 
02:27:11.870 --> 02:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
really didn't have enough
 
02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:14.230 align:start position:0%
really didn't have enough
um

02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:19.010 --> 02:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
information or enough agreement between
 
02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:20.270 align:start position:0%
information or enough agreement between
um

02:27:20.270 --> 02:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:23.809 --> 02:27:23.819 align:start position:0%
companies to put together
 
02:27:26.929 --> 02:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
an amendment and if I might if I may
 
02:27:29.690 --> 02:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
I'll explain to you the difficulty
 
02:27:29.700 --> 02:27:30.650 align:start position:0%
I'll explain to you the difficulty
um

02:27:30.650 --> 02:27:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:33.650 --> 02:27:33.660 align:start position:0%
all the telephone poles whether they be
 
02:27:35.990 --> 02:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
duplicate or not are listed in a puc
 
02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.490 align:start position:0%
duplicate or not are listed in a puc
database

02:27:37.490 --> 02:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
database
 
02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
there are hundreds of thousands of these
 
02:27:41.809 --> 02:27:41.819 align:start position:0%
telephone poles
 
02:27:44.450 --> 02:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
and the piece the electric companies are
 
02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
required to participate in this in this
 
02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:50.330 align:start position:0%
required to participate in this in this
database

02:27:50.330 --> 02:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
database
 
02:27:53.450 --> 02:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
and so as any activity that's done on
 
02:27:55.969 --> 02:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
these telephone poles by the utility
 
02:27:58.610 --> 02:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
polls is called them by the the electric
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
company has to be is monitored through
 
02:28:03.170 --> 02:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
this puc database
 
02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
however cable companies and telephone
 
02:28:10.370 --> 02:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
companies volunteer to participate
 
02:28:12.650 --> 02:28:12.660 align:start position:0%
so some do some don't
 
02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
but there's no
 
02:28:17.210 --> 02:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
mandatory time for them
 
02:28:20.450 --> 02:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
to move their equipment from one pole to
 
02:28:22.610 --> 02:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
the other so we have this sort of
 
02:28:24.650 --> 02:28:24.660 align:start position:0%
mishmash of
 
02:28:26.330 --> 02:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
you know at that level we have a
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
mishmash of participation which makes it
 
02:28:31.070 --> 02:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
very difficult and the puc has no
 
02:28:33.290 --> 02:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to mandate anything for
 
02:28:33.300 --> 02:28:34.070 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to mandate anything for
them

02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:28:36.170 --> 02:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
to them so that's what makes it
 
02:28:38.929 --> 02:28:38.939 align:start position:0%
difficult The Hope was to just give this
 
02:28:42.770 --> 02:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
to puc and let them be the the company
 
02:28:46.969 --> 02:28:46.979 align:start position:0%
to the the process to in which to carry
 
02:28:49.309 --> 02:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
this out but based on current rsas
 
02:28:51.290 --> 02:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
they're unable to
 
02:28:54.290 --> 02:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
and they don't have the
 
02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:55.550 align:start position:0%
and they don't have the
um

02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:57.530 --> 02:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
they don't really have the they don't
 
02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
know they need they need this commission
 
02:29:02.330 --> 02:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
this is why they're proposing the
 
02:29:03.650 --> 02:29:03.660 align:start position:0%
commission so they can have this
 
02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
conversation between all these entities
 
02:29:08.270 --> 02:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
so they can actually take that on so
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
then the bill would be at the end to
 
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
um enact what the commission
 
02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:14.830 align:start position:0%
um enact what the commission
um

02:29:14.830 --> 02:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
recommends if
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:23.410 --> 02:29:23.420 align:start position:0%
did that helped
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission is on the
 
02:29:30.290 --> 02:29:30.300 align:start position:0%
list of speakers so that we can probably
 
02:29:32.450 --> 02:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
get additional information there did you
 
02:29:34.969 --> 02:29:34.979 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up representative McGee I
 
02:29:36.349 --> 02:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
just had a thought that would be a
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes it it which is would it be
 
02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
possible that this could be something
 
02:29:43.130 --> 02:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
that could be a Public Utilities
 
02:29:44.990 --> 02:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
Commission docket because they do study
 
02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
commissions there all the time
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and maybe in this type of year it
 
02:29:51.650 --> 02:29:51.660 align:start position:0%
would be easier to to authorize that
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
through this motion rather than try and
 
02:29:55.130 --> 02:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
have it be something that's done in the
 
02:29:57.170 --> 02:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
house right
 
02:29:59.690 --> 02:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
we can ask them when they come up but
 
02:30:02.270 --> 02:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna call her and find out
 
02:30:05.809 --> 02:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%

02:31:45.050 --> 02:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
Commission it's nice to see you all
 
02:31:46.670 --> 02:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
again so soon
 
02:31:49.250 --> 02:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh representative gota asked me to
 
02:31:52.990 --> 02:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
attend today to comment on the bill
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
for you
 
02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
and the issue of polls in the rights of
 
02:32:01.130 --> 02:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
way involves many interests which I
 
02:32:02.510 --> 02:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
think the representative was just
 
02:32:03.889 --> 02:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
alluding to
 
02:32:06.710 --> 02:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
it involves the cities and towns the
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
state and different companies in
 
02:32:12.050 --> 02:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
addition to the public utilities
 
02:32:14.450 --> 02:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
some polls are owned by public utilities
 
02:32:16.370 --> 02:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
and some are not
 
02:32:18.889 --> 02:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
there are issues specifically related to
 
02:32:21.230 --> 02:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
rights of way and there are issues
 
02:32:23.570 --> 02:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
specifically related to utilities and
 
02:32:26.150 --> 02:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
the facilities attached to polls related
 
02:32:27.469 --> 02:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
to them
 
02:32:29.570 --> 02:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction for addressing those
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
issues currently lies with different
 
02:32:34.429 --> 02:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
state agencies with the municipalities
 
02:32:38.510 --> 02:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
and and towns and there's sort of a
 
02:32:42.550 --> 02:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
mishmash of existing statutes out there
 
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
that need to be considered and taken
 
02:32:47.450 --> 02:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
into account when coming up with the
 
02:32:49.610 --> 02:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
best way to proceed to address these
 
02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:51.290 align:start position:0%
best way to proceed to address these
issues

02:32:51.290 --> 02:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
the legislation appears to have been
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully crafted to include the
 
02:32:57.950 --> 02:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
parties that really need to be part of
 
02:32:59.809 --> 02:32:59.819 align:start position:0%
that conversation
 
02:33:03.530 --> 02:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
and and to get the right outcome from
 
02:33:07.250 --> 02:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
this and so for those reasons I would
 
02:33:09.050 --> 02:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that this bill
 
02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
remain a study commission Bill and be
 
02:33:13.790 --> 02:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
permitted to proceed despite the
 
02:33:15.410 --> 02:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
pandemic and I know that's something
 
02:33:19.309 --> 02:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
that is not happening routinely
 
02:33:22.130 --> 02:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
um but I will say that the puc is happy
 
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
to assist in any way it can to make that
 
02:33:27.469 --> 02:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
happen we regularly do
 
02:33:30.950 --> 02:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
um WebEx proceedings and can certainly
 
02:33:33.290 --> 02:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
facilitate that and I've been
 
02:33:34.910 --> 02:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
participating in the offshore wind
 
02:33:36.770 --> 02:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
commission which has been meeting
 
02:33:40.010 --> 02:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
monthly remotely and it's worked really
 
02:33:42.530 --> 02:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
well so I think it is possible and I
 
02:33:45.290 --> 02:33:45.300 align:start position:0%
think that if there's one bill that
 
02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
really should be able to proceed despite
 
02:33:49.070 --> 02:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
02:33:50.929 --> 02:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
because of the significance of this
 
02:33:53.690 --> 02:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
issue and because of the multitude of
 
02:33:56.030 --> 02:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
Interest parties and statutes that it
 
02:34:02.929 --> 02:34:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:04.670 --> 02:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and if you have
 
02:34:07.010 --> 02:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
any questions I'm happy to answer them
 
02:34:08.990 --> 02:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms Martin
 
02:34:12.590 --> 02:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
um I see we have a question the chair
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Kelly Pitts
 
02:34:22.090 --> 02:34:22.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:25.010 --> 02:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I fully
 
02:34:27.230 --> 02:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
agree that this is a problem and I've
 
02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
been involved in a couple of them myself
 
02:34:31.610 --> 02:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to ask you
 
02:34:35.389 --> 02:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the puc can take
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
partial jurisdiction
 
02:34:40.730 --> 02:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
over a private company and that's what
 
02:34:43.550 --> 02:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
in many cases we are dealing with you
 
02:34:45.170 --> 02:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
know we deregulated the telephone
 
02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
company we we took them out of the
 
02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:49.130 align:start position:0%
company we we took them out of the
jurisdiction

02:34:49.130 --> 02:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
cable companies and not under the on the
 
02:34:55.010 --> 02:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
auspices of the puc or do you believe
 
02:34:57.950 --> 02:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
that this commission would simply be to
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
get them all at the table and don't you
 
02:35:02.690 --> 02:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
believe that that could do you believe
 
02:35:04.429 --> 02:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
that that could be done
 
02:35:08.330 --> 02:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
without a study Commission
 
02:35:11.570 --> 02:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
it's loaded I know but there are a
 
02:35:13.490 --> 02:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
couple pieces to that
 
02:35:16.490 --> 02:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
um first I think that the puc has some
 
02:35:19.250 --> 02:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction already related to poll
 
02:35:21.050 --> 02:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
attachments which you're you're all
 
02:35:22.849 --> 02:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
02:35:27.530 --> 02:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
covers sort of the facilities related to
 
02:35:30.530 --> 02:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
utilities that are on the polls which is
 
02:35:33.230 --> 02:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
sort of separate from the issue of polls
 
02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
themselves particularly if they don't
 
02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:36.349 align:start position:0%
themselves particularly if they don't
have

02:35:36.349 --> 02:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:35:39.050 --> 02:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
utility facility utility facilities or
 
02:35:40.790 --> 02:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
other facilities on them if you just
 
02:35:43.490 --> 02:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
have a poll in a right-of-way
 
02:35:47.389 --> 02:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
um that poses sort of a different issue
 
02:35:50.330 --> 02:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
um and the jurisdiction for that
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
really is with whoever owns the right of
 
02:35:56.510 --> 02:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
way and there are current statutes right
 
02:35:59.450 --> 02:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
now for towns and municipalities in my
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
prior role I used to represent the
 
02:36:04.849 --> 02:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
department of transportation we often
 
02:36:07.790 --> 02:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
encountered issues related to things in
 
02:36:09.410 --> 02:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
the right-of-way that shouldn't be there
 
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
and took action and that was generally
 
02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
in Superior Court and and was and can be
 
02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
effective and effective quickly and so I
 
02:36:21.170 --> 02:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
think the point is that there are
 
02:36:24.170 --> 02:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
different interests here there are
 
02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
already existing
 
02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:27.469 align:start position:0%
already existing
um

02:36:27.469 --> 02:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
statutes to address them but they are
 
02:36:31.370 --> 02:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
not really
 
02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
um working well together and so I think
 
02:36:37.070 --> 02:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
the commission would would be well
 
02:36:39.170 --> 02:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
served to be created and bring those
 
02:36:41.870 --> 02:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
people together to address the bigger
 
02:36:44.090 --> 02:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
picture but even more importantly to
 
02:36:47.690 --> 02:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
make sure that the resulting statutes
 
02:36:49.730 --> 02:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
um reflect each other in a way that
 
02:36:52.130 --> 02:36:52.140 align:start position:0%
makes sense so that you know if it's a
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
poll in a right-of-way there's an action
 
02:36:57.010 --> 02:36:57.020 align:start position:0%
that can be taken that's fairly Swift
 
02:36:59.990 --> 02:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
versus a process that's related to
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
facilities on polls and moving those
 
02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:03.889 align:start position:0%
facilities on polls and moving those
which

02:37:03.889 --> 02:37:03.899 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:37:06.530 --> 02:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
um can sometimes tend to be lengthier
 
02:37:10.130 --> 02:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
and more cumbersome so I I just think
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
that the commission that you have before
 
02:37:16.490 --> 02:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
you brings the right people together and
 
02:37:18.410 --> 02:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
that the puc is just a piece of the
 
02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:19.670 align:start position:0%
that the puc is just a piece of the
puzzle

02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
puzzle
 
02:37:24.170 --> 02:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
and the puc alone would not cover the
 
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
gamut of the issues that you guys are
 
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
looking to address
 
02:37:30.469 --> 02:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:37:32.929 --> 02:37:32.939 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
Thomas for a question thank you Mr chair
 
02:37:38.030 --> 02:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:39.230 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:43.010 --> 02:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
does the BC currently have any rules
 
02:37:45.170 --> 02:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
that sets a time limit
 
02:37:47.330 --> 02:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
for the agencies that they do have
 
02:37:50.690 --> 02:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over to remove such polls
 
02:37:55.550 --> 02:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
and if they do have have those times uh
 
02:37:59.210 --> 02:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
limitations been met and if not are
 
02:38:00.889 --> 02:38:00.899 align:start position:0%
there is there any enforcement mechanism
 
02:38:06.650 --> 02:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:08.929 --> 02:38:08.939 align:start position:0%
our current jurisdiction really is
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
related to poll attachments and so
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's the the things that the wires and
 
02:38:16.969 --> 02:38:16.979 align:start position:0%
the other things that you see on polls
 
02:38:19.730 --> 02:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
and it really relates to
 
02:38:22.730 --> 02:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
how and when those attachments can be
 
02:38:26.210 --> 02:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
put onto polls and the jurisdiction is
 
02:38:29.330 --> 02:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
actually pretty Limited in that
 
02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:30.950 align:start position:0%
actually pretty Limited in that
um once

02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
um once
 
02:38:33.050 --> 02:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
they're they're supposed to be voluntary
 
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
agreements and so
 
02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
um to the extent they can't be reached
 
02:38:40.670 --> 02:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
then there is the ability to come to the
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
commission and ask for sort of a
 
02:38:46.130 --> 02:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
resolution of the dispute if there can't
 
02:38:48.170 --> 02:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
be an agreement
 
02:38:48.180 --> 02:38:48.830 align:start position:0%
be an agreement
um

02:38:48.830 --> 02:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:52.670 --> 02:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
and so it doesn't really get into
 
02:38:54.650 --> 02:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
all of the parts that you're looking at
 
02:38:58.370 --> 02:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
which are more related or at least
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
um at least as related to just the
 
02:39:03.650 --> 02:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
existence of polls in rights of way
 
02:39:05.929 --> 02:39:05.939 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:39:07.790 --> 02:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
I think traditionally a right-of-way
 
02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:12.410 align:start position:0%
I think traditionally a right-of-way
issue

02:39:12.410 --> 02:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:15.710 --> 02:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
no follow-up needed apparently Ms Martin
 
02:39:18.110 --> 02:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
I have a question we heard an earlier
 
02:39:20.710 --> 02:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
02:39:25.010 --> 02:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
towns can and frequently do tax these
 
02:39:26.809 --> 02:39:26.819 align:start position:0%
unused polls
 
02:39:30.590 --> 02:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
is it possible that the tax
 
02:39:34.910 --> 02:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
that the owner of the poll pays is less
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
than the cost of removing the pole even
 
02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:48.170 --> 02:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
I don't sit in that area
 
02:39:51.050 --> 02:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
um and so I can't really tell you the
 
02:39:54.590 --> 02:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
significance of the taxes and whether
 
02:39:57.290 --> 02:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
that has an impact
 
02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay I thank you for for that answer see
 
02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
no more questions for Ms Martin I thank
 
02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
you Miss Martin for being here this
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%

our members Communications networks are

polls in New Hampshire virtually all of
 
02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
them are owned either solely or jointly

to be clear we don't oppose HP 169
 
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:39.969 align:start position:0%
to be clear we don't oppose HP 169
because

02:41:39.969 --> 02:41:39.979 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:41:43.450 --> 02:41:43.460 align:start position:0%
we view this as a non-issue or concern
 
02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
rather we come to the table believing
 
02:41:49.490 --> 02:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
that the puc does in fact have Authority
 
02:41:52.309 --> 02:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
Under the 1300 rules over poll
 
02:41:52.319 --> 02:41:54.410 align:start position:0%
Under the 1300 rules over poll
attachments

02:41:54.410 --> 02:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
attachments
 
02:41:55.790 --> 02:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
um we also believe that they have
 
02:41:59.330 --> 02:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
Authority Under New Hampshire RSA 374-1
 
02:42:01.130 --> 02:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
which establishes that every public
 
02:42:03.170 --> 02:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
utility shall furnish such service and
 
02:42:05.150 --> 02:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
facilities and shall be reasonably safe
 
02:42:07.490 --> 02:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
and adequate and in all other respects
 
02:42:09.469 --> 02:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable
 
02:42:11.630 --> 02:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
so with all due respect to to
 
02:42:14.210 --> 02:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
commissioner Martin I appreciate her
 
02:42:16.010 --> 02:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
perspective about the complexity of
 
02:42:17.570 --> 02:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
02:42:19.370 --> 02:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
um we were going to speak this morning
 
02:42:21.650 --> 02:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
to the fact that we actually believe the
 
02:42:24.889 --> 02:42:24.899 align:start position:0%
puc has the statutory Authority the
 
02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
administrative processes and the and the
 
02:42:30.610 --> 02:42:30.620 align:start position:0%
expertise to ensure a balanced
 
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
well-informed stakeholder process
 
02:42:36.410 --> 02:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
um in recent years the commission has
 
02:42:38.809 --> 02:42:38.819 align:start position:0%
undertaken investigations into utility
 
02:42:41.929 --> 02:42:41.939 align:start position:0%
pulse safety for example as well as rule
 
02:42:44.210 --> 02:42:44.220 align:start position:0%
makings regarding poll attachments and
 
02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
make-ready timelines and we in fact were
 
02:42:49.490 --> 02:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
participants in the 1300 rulemaking
 
02:42:49.500 --> 02:42:51.770 align:start position:0%
participants in the 1300 rulemaking
process

02:42:51.770 --> 02:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:42:53.929 --> 02:42:53.939 align:start position:0%
um and we recognize that the commission
 
02:42:55.670 --> 02:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
continues to use its dispute resolution
 
02:42:58.070 --> 02:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
authority to resolve conflicts between
 
02:43:00.650 --> 02:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
poll owners and attachers as well as
 
02:43:04.370 --> 02:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
municipalities and Pool owners
 
02:43:06.770 --> 02:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
um we believe that given the complexity
 
02:43:08.570 --> 02:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
of these issues that the POC would be
 
02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
the most appropriate venue and again we
 
02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
welcome a conversation with
 
02:43:16.010 --> 02:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
um the commission
 
02:43:18.889 --> 02:43:18.899 align:start position:0%
um and the stakeholders and
 
02:43:18.899 --> 02:43:20.150 align:start position:0%
um and the stakeholders and
um

02:43:20.150 --> 02:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:22.130 --> 02:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
would welcome participation in any
 
02:43:25.030 --> 02:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholder process with which results
 
02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
preferably within the the commission
 
02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I appreciate your time today
 
02:43:34.429 --> 02:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
we're happy to work with you and again
 
02:43:37.730 --> 02:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
we would urge that hb69 be voted in
 
02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and we look
 
02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:49.190 --> 02:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms Weston for your testimony
 
02:43:56.349 --> 02:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will ask if it is
 
02:44:07.010 --> 02:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:10.070 --> 02:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't see it
 
02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh well it's on my screen and recognized
 
02:44:15.170 --> 02:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
to ask a question
 
02:44:16.690 --> 02:44:16.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman uh Miss
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
Weston um
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
I I understand your perspective here but
 
02:44:27.359 --> 02:44:28.550 align:start position:0%
I I understand your perspective here but
um

02:44:28.550 --> 02:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:31.010 --> 02:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
couldn't this be resolved unless
 
02:44:34.429 --> 02:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic way uh couldn't your
 
02:44:37.150 --> 02:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
members or your company's
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
voluntarily pledge that within a certain
 
02:44:42.290 --> 02:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
time interval they will remove their
 
02:44:44.990 --> 02:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
things from those polls without having
 
02:44:47.929 --> 02:44:47.939 align:start position:0%
to have coercion or enforcement
 
02:44:50.750 --> 02:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
certainly representative in fact our
 
02:44:55.429 --> 02:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
members participate in a system and not
 
02:44:57.469 --> 02:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
sure exactly what the acronym stands for
 
02:45:00.590 --> 02:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
but it's known as engines which is a
 
02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
system it's a a computer system that is
 
02:45:06.950 --> 02:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
used to facilitate Communications among
 
02:45:07.990 --> 02:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
in between
 
02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
companies both the poll owners and the
 
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
attachers to facilitate
 
02:45:16.309 --> 02:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
um the process and the most expedited
 
02:45:16.319 --> 02:45:17.380 align:start position:0%
um the process and the most expedited
process

02:45:17.380 --> 02:45:17.390 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:45:17.390 --> 02:45:18.770 align:start position:0%
process
[Music]

02:45:18.770 --> 02:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:45:22.130 --> 02:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's realistic and that can
 
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
be managed so we do rely on a process
 
02:45:28.130 --> 02:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
currently that we think actually should
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
remain the process and it has by and
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
large worked although we recognize that
 
02:45:35.870 --> 02:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
the Dual poll issue you know is is there
 
02:45:38.990 --> 02:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
but for our attachers the engines
 
02:45:41.690 --> 02:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
process has worked well it is
 
02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:42.429 align:start position:0%
process has worked well it is
um

02:45:42.429 --> 02:45:42.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:45.349 --> 02:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh essentially an agreement among
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
attachers and poll owners and
 
02:45:50.809 --> 02:45:50.819 align:start position:0%
um we would be happy to to provide you
 
02:45:53.690 --> 02:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
more information about that system and
 
02:45:56.330 --> 02:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps engines could provide some
 
02:46:01.250 --> 02:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:03.050 align:start position:0%
 
Representatives

02:46:03.050 --> 02:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
02:46:04.790 --> 02:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah
 
02:46:07.849 --> 02:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman well uh
 
02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
having heard what Representative Vincent
 
02:46:12.410 --> 02:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
just mentioned where we're talking about
 
02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
thousands of poll double polls in a
 
02:46:17.929 --> 02:46:17.939 align:start position:0%
small area and also that some of these
 
02:46:21.290 --> 02:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
are there for years uh obviously your
 
02:46:26.570 --> 02:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:29.570 --> 02:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
um well I I can't speak to those
 
02:46:31.730 --> 02:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
specific instances
 
02:46:32.929 --> 02:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
um Mike I could certainly get
 
02:46:35.389 --> 02:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
information from my clients for you my
 
02:46:37.370 --> 02:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
understanding is that engines has by and
 
02:46:39.469 --> 02:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
large worked quite well over the years
 
02:46:42.349 --> 02:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
and that yes there are situations where
 
02:46:44.570 --> 02:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
there have been miscommunications or
 
02:46:46.610 --> 02:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
where notification hasn't happened
 
02:46:50.510 --> 02:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
through engines as it should have and
 
02:46:53.210 --> 02:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
therefore unfortunate circumstances have
 
02:46:53.220 --> 02:46:54.950 align:start position:0%
therefore unfortunate circumstances have
resulted

02:46:54.950 --> 02:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
resulted
 
02:46:54.960 --> 02:46:55.870 align:start position:0%
resulted
um

02:46:55.870 --> 02:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:00.050 --> 02:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
and so that is my limited knowledge of
 
02:47:01.849 --> 02:47:01.859 align:start position:0%
where we have had issues that it has
 
02:47:03.590 --> 02:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
resulted from a miscommunication through
 
02:47:06.170 --> 02:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
that computer system where the next
 
02:47:09.050 --> 02:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
attacher or the uh the attacher hasn't
 
02:47:11.210 --> 02:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
notified the next attacher in line and
 
02:47:14.030 --> 02:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
it was a Communications breakdown that's
 
02:47:15.770 --> 02:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
my understanding and my knowledge and
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
again I'm happy to do more research for
 
02:47:22.550 --> 02:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:25.389 --> 02:47:25.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
 
02:47:27.950 --> 02:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
I'd remind you that we're here to gather
 
02:47:30.170 --> 02:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
information not to debate with the
 
02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
presenters representative Bernardi is
 
02:47:35.809 --> 02:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
02:47:39.889 --> 02:47:39.899 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman both uh so this is a
 
02:47:42.590 --> 02:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
question from for I think two presenters
 
02:47:46.070 --> 02:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
here speak loudly because what I heard
 
02:47:50.570 --> 02:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
is the last presenter say that the 1300
 
02:47:53.990 --> 02:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
rule series of the puc provides
 
02:47:57.290 --> 02:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction for the puc to take action
 
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
yet I heard the commission saying
 
02:48:02.870 --> 02:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have the ability so
 
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
can there be a Reconciliation of that
 
02:48:08.750 --> 02:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
point of view do we actually need
 
02:48:11.450 --> 02:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
some action here in order to resolve
 
02:48:11.460 --> 02:48:16.730 align:start position:0%
some action here in order to resolve
this

02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:16.740 --> 02:48:17.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:48:17.450 --> 02:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:20.030 --> 02:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair is that question directed at me
 
02:48:22.250 --> 02:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
Mara Weston or
 
02:48:24.590 --> 02:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
would you like me to respond
 
02:48:27.410 --> 02:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
that's a question this is Ms Weston okay
 
02:48:28.969 --> 02:48:28.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:28.979 --> 02:48:30.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:48:30.590 --> 02:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's my client's position that
 
02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:34.670 align:start position:0%
uh it's my client's position that
um

02:48:34.670 --> 02:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
these issues could be addressed within
 
02:48:39.469 --> 02:48:39.479 align:start position:0%
the current context of the puc's
 
02:48:42.650 --> 02:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
authority and jurisdiction and existing
 
02:48:42.660 --> 02:48:43.790 align:start position:0%
authority and jurisdiction and existing
rules

02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:48:46.730 --> 02:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
um again with respect to commissioner
 
02:48:49.610 --> 02:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
Martin as to the complexity of these
 
02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
issues I certainly understand where
 
02:48:55.070 --> 02:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
she's coming from but we believe that
 
02:48:58.550 --> 02:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
the puc would be an appropriate venue
 
02:49:01.130 --> 02:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
um for this conversation to unfold and
 
02:49:03.469 --> 02:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
frankly that this legislation is not
 
02:49:03.479 --> 02:49:07.550 align:start position:0%
frankly that this legislation is not
necessary

02:49:07.550 --> 02:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:09.170 --> 02:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up
 
02:49:09.180 --> 02:49:10.790 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up
s

02:49:10.790 --> 02:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
s
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
chairman so then commissioner Martin do
 
02:49:17.870 --> 02:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
you agree that you have the authority as
 
02:49:26.590 --> 02:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
that question is directed at
 
02:49:30.230 --> 02:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner Martin are you still there
 
02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:39.410 align:start position:0%
commissioner Martin are you still there
commissioner

02:49:39.410 --> 02:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:41.929 --> 02:49:41.939 align:start position:0%
hi there sorry I had to be promoted
 
02:49:44.090 --> 02:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
again so I could speak
 
02:49:47.870 --> 02:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
um so the current Authority for the
 
02:49:50.870 --> 02:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
commission relates to poll attachments
 
02:49:56.690 --> 02:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
it's statutory Authority in RSA 374 34A
 
02:50:02.090 --> 02:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
and our rules rely on that Authority
 
02:50:04.730 --> 02:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
um and that and the rules the 1300 rules
 
02:50:07.910 --> 02:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
also relate to poll attachments and
 
02:50:10.730 --> 02:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
that's why my point was this is a
 
02:50:14.270 --> 02:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
multi-part issue you have polls which
 
02:50:16.670 --> 02:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
are in rights of way which may or may
 
02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
not have facilities on them our rules
 
02:50:21.230 --> 02:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
02:50:24.410 --> 02:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
polls poll attachments and give us
 
02:50:27.050 --> 02:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
Authority within that realm they are
 
02:50:30.170 --> 02:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
somewhat limited as well in the the
 
02:50:33.469 --> 02:50:33.479 align:start position:0%
definition in the statute which refers
 
02:50:36.770 --> 02:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
to polls owned by public utilities and
 
02:50:39.710 --> 02:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
for example Comcast is not a public
 
02:50:43.309 --> 02:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
utility and so the polls would not be
 
02:50:46.610 --> 02:50:46.620 align:start position:0%
subject they're polls owned by them
 
02:50:49.250 --> 02:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
fully owned by them would not be subject
 
02:50:51.770 --> 02:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
to the statute and so I I think that the
 
02:50:53.630 --> 02:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
statement related to our Authority is
 
02:50:57.530 --> 02:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
over Broad and I think that it um
 
02:51:00.469 --> 02:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
it does not cover the entire issue which
 
02:51:06.410 --> 02:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:10.670 --> 02:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh see no further questions
 
02:51:13.910 --> 02:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
let me ask if there are any persons on
 
02:51:17.389 --> 02:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
this in this meeting who have not signed
 
02:51:26.030 --> 02:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:29.150 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:51:29.150 --> 02:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:32.570 --> 02:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the public
 
02:51:37.910 --> 02:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
and reward everybody on the committee
 
02:51:43.130 --> 02:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
with an extra eight minutes on your
 
02:51:45.889 --> 02:51:45.899 align:start position:0%
lunch break representative momila did
 
02:51:48.890 --> 02:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:48.900 --> 02:51:50.469 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:51:53.570 --> 02:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
on a duet I wanted to State something
 
02:51:54.889 --> 02:51:54.899 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I don't really care anymore
 
02:51:56.809 --> 02:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to State something for the
 
02:52:00.469 --> 02:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
record uh regarding house billing okay
 
02:52:05.210 --> 02:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:05.220 --> 02:52:07.010 align:start position:0%
 
basis

02:52:07.010 --> 02:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
basis
 
02:52:07.020 --> 02:52:11.570 align:start position:0%
basis
I

02:52:11.570 --> 02:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:13.969 --> 02:52:13.979 align:start position:0%
work it really comes down to I don't
 
02:52:15.650 --> 02:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
think that it's fair or appropriate for
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
us to
 
02:52:20.450 --> 02:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
take money away and start another fund I
 
02:52:22.969 --> 02:52:22.979 align:start position:0%
agree with some of the comments that
 
02:52:25.130 --> 02:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas made but I one of
 
02:52:26.690 --> 02:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
the points I just wanted to state is
 
02:52:28.550 --> 02:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
that I acknowledge that I may have
 
02:52:30.650 --> 02:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
misunderstood the New Hampshire saves
 
02:52:33.769 --> 02:52:33.779 align:start position:0%
program but I I do want to say that the
 
02:52:35.750 --> 02:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
majority of the testimony time that we
 
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
had for questions the hard part of that
 
02:52:41.450 --> 02:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
was that it was taken up really by kind
 
02:52:44.630 --> 02:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
of teed up questions that just appeared
 
02:52:46.429 --> 02:52:46.439 align:start position:0%
to validate the reason for the bill in
 
02:52:48.590 --> 02:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
the first place and it really left no
 
02:52:50.570 --> 02:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
time for German questions I really
 
02:52:52.490 --> 02:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about the answer stage a
 
02:52:54.290 --> 02:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
little bit more and I had follow-up
 
02:52:56.030 --> 02:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
questions and I I would have loved to
 
02:52:58.730 --> 02:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
have been clarified on that and I just
 
02:53:01.610 --> 02:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of say that when we when
 
02:53:03.050 --> 02:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions that right
 
02:53:05.630 --> 02:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
off the clock that just validate the
 
02:53:08.330 --> 02:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
bill it actually leads far less time
 
02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
questions to clarify the bill thank you
 
02:53:12.769 --> 02:53:12.779 align:start position:0%
so much thank you chair
 
02:53:15.469 --> 02:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samchitzer
 
02:53:18.590 --> 02:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
02:53:18.600 --> 02:53:19.969 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
um

02:53:19.969 --> 02:53:19.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:23.630 --> 02:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
remember the uh yes thank you Mr sp169.
 
02:53:26.510 --> 02:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's just a a point of order here uh as
 
02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
as I uh mentioned to you previously uh
 
02:53:35.150 --> 02:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
since I have to testify uh at another
 
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
committee on a bill at one o'clock uh
 
02:53:41.809 --> 02:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
you agree to postpone my bill to 130 is
 
02:53:43.250 --> 02:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
02:53:45.590 --> 02:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
I did agree to that and I appreciate you
 
02:53:48.230 --> 02:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
reminding me of that uh skipping 3
 
02:53:53.570 --> 02:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:56.030 --> 02:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay I just want to know then then our
 
02:53:58.130 --> 02:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
lunch break would go to 1 30 is that
 
02:53:58.140 --> 02:53:59.330 align:start position:0%
lunch break would go to 1 30 is that
correct

02:53:59.330 --> 02:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:54:02.690 --> 02:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
1 30. no we'll take up that Bill yes at
 
02:54:05.269 --> 02:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
1 30 basically I mean Mr chairman I
 
02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
think he's asking if we have an extended
 
02:54:08.330 --> 02:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
lunch and now we're not coming back
 
02:54:11.030 --> 02:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
until 1 30. yes
 
02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:14.030 align:start position:0%
until 1 30. yes
um

02:54:14.030 --> 02:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
what I originally stated was that we
 
02:54:19.309 --> 02:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
would open the hearing on your bill at
 
02:54:20.389 --> 02:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
one o'clock
 
02:54:24.050 --> 02:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
and then recess it until 1 30.
 
02:54:27.950 --> 02:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
so to do that
 
02:54:29.690 --> 02:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
at least I need to be in the room I
 
02:54:31.070 --> 02:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if anybody else needs to be
 
02:54:33.710 --> 02:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
in the room okay but we need to have the
 
02:54:36.349 --> 02:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
recording going at one o'clock
 
02:54:36.359 --> 02:54:37.250 align:start position:0%
recording going at one o'clock
um

02:54:37.250 --> 02:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:41.450 --> 02:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
so that we can we can recess uh
 
02:54:43.309 --> 02:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:54:43.319 --> 02:54:45.969 align:start position:0%
the bill
um

02:54:45.969 --> 02:54:45.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:52.969 --> 02:54:52.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:59.269 --> 02:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
who who wants to speak
 
02:55:02.750 --> 02:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
oh I just wanted to clarify you need to
 
02:55:05.150 --> 02:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
have someone there at one o'clock to
 
02:55:07.190 --> 02:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
recess the hearing is that what you're
 
02:55:09.410 --> 02:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
saying in which case may be represent
 
02:55:11.330 --> 02:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
McGee could be there if you have to have
 
02:55:12.950 --> 02:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
more than one person you don't need to
 
02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:14.630 align:start position:0%
more than one person you don't need to
have

02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:55:16.190 --> 02:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
I think we just need you there
 
02:55:19.130 --> 02:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
representative samsich to basically
 
02:55:20.870 --> 02:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill
 
02:55:23.570 --> 02:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
and then I can't do it I can't do it at
 
02:55:25.929 --> 02:55:25.939 align:start position:0%
one o'clock
 
02:55:27.950 --> 02:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives I'm sorry for
 
02:55:30.830 --> 02:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
interrupting but I I think it's okay
 
02:55:33.710 --> 02:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
um you can't open a bill early you can't
 
02:55:35.990 --> 02:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
you can't open a two o'clock bill at one
 
02:55:37.969 --> 02:55:37.979 align:start position:0%
o'clock but if you need to open the bill
 
02:55:41.769 --> 02:55:41.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:44.570 --> 02:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
which is the way it's been done and
 
02:55:46.309 --> 02:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
recess the hair and you can open the
 
02:55:49.190 --> 02:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
hearing and recess the hearing
 
02:55:52.250 --> 02:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
you don't need anyone there to do that
 
02:55:55.849 --> 02:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
okay the only one that you can do that
 
02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
by yourself
 
02:55:59.210 --> 02:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
okay now we're going to have half the
 
02:56:01.250 --> 02:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
time for the hearing why can't we open
 
02:56:04.130 --> 02:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
the hearing and have the sponsor present
 
02:56:08.030 --> 02:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
his remarks at 1 30. you can
 
02:56:10.969 --> 02:56:10.979 align:start position:0%
yes that's what we're going to do
 
02:56:12.650 --> 02:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
but because it's
 
02:56:15.469 --> 02:56:15.479 align:start position:0%
well I have a recess we have to open it
 
02:56:17.090 --> 02:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock and then recess it until
 
02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
1 30. I don't understand the need for a
 
02:56:24.349 --> 02:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
recess we have so little time we just
 
02:56:27.230 --> 02:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
had an explanation from one member that
 
02:56:30.290 --> 02:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
she would have appreciated more time for
 
02:56:30.300 --> 02:56:31.849 align:start position:0%
she would have appreciated more time for
clarification

02:56:31.849 --> 02:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
02:56:31.859 --> 02:56:33.290 align:start position:0%
clarification
and

02:56:33.290 --> 02:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:36.410 --> 02:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
I I I don't think there's any I think
 
02:56:38.389 --> 02:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
it's crazy we're gonna go just go from 1
 
02:56:41.690 --> 02:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
30 to 2 and then slam that hearing into
 
02:56:44.330 --> 02:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
even less time
 
02:56:46.210 --> 02:56:46.220 align:start position:0%
doing this is a courtesy for
 
02:56:48.610 --> 02:56:48.620 align:start position:0%
representative sausage
 
02:56:52.070 --> 02:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I have no objection to uh
 
02:56:53.929 --> 02:56:53.939 align:start position:0%
you opening the hearing at one o'clock
 
02:56:56.210 --> 02:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
and allowing me then to come back at 1
 
02:57:00.769 --> 02:57:00.779 align:start position:0%

02:57:05.870 --> 02:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
testify anytime you anytime you desire
 
02:57:08.870 --> 02:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay well then then you don't need to
 
02:57:11.929 --> 02:57:11.939 align:start position:0%
recess the hearing I'd say right
 
02:57:15.290 --> 02:57:15.300 align:start position:0%

04:00:27.229 --> 04:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor is Peter representative
 
04:00:28.849 --> 04:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
Peter samstrich
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
he will not be available to speak on the
 
04:00:33.650 --> 04:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
bill until approximately 1 30.
 
04:00:35.929 --> 04:00:35.939 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to ask representatively
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
oxenham who's also a sponsor on the bill
 
04:00:42.110 --> 04:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
I believe or maybe not uh anyway so she
 
04:00:44.809 --> 04:00:44.819 align:start position:0%
has signed up to speak so I'm going to
 
04:00:48.650 --> 04:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
ask representative oxenham to take the
 
04:00:52.670 --> 04:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
floor and give us her best shot at
 
04:00:54.950 --> 04:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
explaining what this bill is all about
 
04:00:57.370 --> 04:00:57.380 align:start position:0%
and I particularly appreciate
 
04:00:59.990 --> 04:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham if you could
 
04:01:04.490 --> 04:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
explain to us why we need
 
04:01:08.410 --> 04:01:08.420 align:start position:0%
a study committee for micro grids since
 
04:01:11.689 --> 04:01:11.699 align:start position:0%
microgrids is a part of the public
 
04:01:13.550 --> 04:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
utilities committee's
 
04:01:13.560 --> 04:01:15.130 align:start position:0%
utilities committee's
commissions

04:01:15.130 --> 04:01:15.140 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
04:01:19.330 --> 04:01:19.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
what's the talking about the docket on
 
04:01:26.590 --> 04:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
grid modernization so help us understand
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
why we need a study committee to study
 
04:01:36.250 --> 04:01:36.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:39.229 --> 04:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute yourself please
 
04:01:40.849 --> 04:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:01:43.309 --> 04:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you for allowing me to go
 
04:01:46.309 --> 04:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
first uh I had my hand up I wanted to
 
04:01:48.710 --> 04:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
ask a question about the the process
 
04:01:50.510 --> 04:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
before we began
 
04:01:52.790 --> 04:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
and in particular
 
04:01:55.130 --> 04:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to know if anyone had
 
04:01:57.769 --> 04:01:57.779 align:start position:0%
provided written testimony on this bill
 
04:01:59.870 --> 04:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
as I understood it
 
04:02:02.030 --> 04:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
we were being compelled to keep our
 
04:02:04.010 --> 04:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
public hearings within one hour but we
 
04:02:05.929 --> 04:02:05.939 align:start position:0%
were supposed to be getting written
 
04:02:07.790 --> 04:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
testimony on which we were supposed to
 
04:02:10.910 --> 04:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
rely for these proceedings I've received
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
no testimony
 
04:02:14.990 --> 04:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
as regards this bill and very little
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
testimony on preceding bills
 
04:02:20.750 --> 04:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let representative Thomas
 
04:02:22.610 --> 04:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
04:02:27.650 --> 04:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative Austin as far as I
 
04:02:30.050 --> 04:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
know I received
 
04:02:34.429 --> 04:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
three written testimonies at least as of
 
04:02:36.530 --> 04:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
12 o'clock last night
 
04:02:39.769 --> 04:02:39.779 align:start position:0%
on HB 376 one of them came from
 
04:02:41.570 --> 04:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
representative sausage
 
04:02:45.950 --> 04:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
one comes from the New Hampshire tumor
 
04:02:48.590 --> 04:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
Association Mr stock
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
and what comes from you
 
04:02:54.349 --> 04:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
so that's all I have in my position
 
04:02:55.429 --> 04:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:02:57.710 --> 04:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
so there was nothing from Consolidated
 
04:02:57.720 --> 04:03:00.950 align:start position:0%
so there was nothing from Consolidated
Communications

04:03:00.950 --> 04:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:04.370 --> 04:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
well they're not even on the list
 
04:03:07.130 --> 04:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
nothing that came to my email that I
 
04:03:09.889 --> 04:03:09.899 align:start position:0%
printed out anyway and I uh I tried my
 
04:03:11.689 --> 04:03:11.699 align:start position:0%
best to hold off but I had to go to
 
04:03:11.699 --> 04:03:12.710 align:start position:0%
best to hold off but I had to go to
sleep

04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
sleep
 
04:03:14.030 --> 04:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that
 
04:03:14.040 --> 04:03:15.830 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that
clarification

04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
04:03:15.840 --> 04:03:17.510 align:start position:0%
clarification
um

04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:20.689 --> 04:03:20.699 align:start position:0%
if if I could proceed uh then directly
 
04:03:22.969 --> 04:03:22.979 align:start position:0%
into a discussion of the bill
 
04:03:25.250 --> 04:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
we ran into difficulties this morning
 
04:03:28.010 --> 04:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
with people not understanding the
 
04:03:29.630 --> 04:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
content of the bill so I'm actually
 
04:03:32.990 --> 04:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
going to begin by quote it's a very very
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
short bill and I'll take you to the
 
04:03:38.450 --> 04:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
duties section the committee shall study
 
04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
the applications of microgrids in New
 
04:03:41.040 --> 04:03:41.929 align:start position:0%
the applications of microgrids in New
Hampshire

04:03:41.929 --> 04:03:41.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
and changes in law necessary to allow
 
04:03:47.689 --> 04:03:47.699 align:start position:0%
for micro good grids in electricity
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
Supply with a view to both near-term and
 
04:03:53.809 --> 04:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
long-term applications in the state
 
04:03:55.910 --> 04:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
for this purpose the committee shall
 
04:03:57.889 --> 04:03:57.899 align:start position:0%
consult with representatives of utility
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
companies companies involved with
 
04:04:01.910 --> 04:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
microgrid development and members of the
 
04:04:03.469 --> 04:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
general public with specific knowledge
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
regarding microgrids and their benefits
 
04:04:10.610 --> 04:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:14.809 --> 04:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
um moving to my own testimony
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
microgrids offer a crucial Safeguard
 
04:04:20.990 --> 04:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
against emergency situations you know I
 
04:04:23.450 --> 04:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
and I think I think I was relying on
 
04:04:25.490 --> 04:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
Peter to have gone first so let me stop
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
there and and just give a brief
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
definition of what a microgrid is
 
04:04:34.250 --> 04:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
and the best example I can give is the
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
one that I actually used in my testimony
 
04:04:38.389 --> 04:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
which is Princeton University during
 
04:04:41.330 --> 04:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
superstorm Sandy the electrical supply
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
system in New Jersey was devastated
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
people went prolonged periods without
 
04:04:49.849 --> 04:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
electricity which meant not only no
 
04:04:53.689 --> 04:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
lights but no water supply no ability to
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
flush toilets it was a it was a major
 
04:05:00.349 --> 04:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
disaster for that state and surrounding
 
04:05:03.410 --> 04:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
states however Ray of good light
 
04:05:05.450 --> 04:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
Princeton University had a microgrid
 
04:05:08.150 --> 04:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
they were able to run classes provide
 
04:05:10.189 --> 04:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
meals have dorms with air conditioning
 
04:05:12.769 --> 04:05:12.779 align:start position:0%
and their students were able to pursue
 
04:05:14.689 --> 04:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
their studies scientists were able to
 
04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
pursue their work teachers were able to
 
04:05:21.769 --> 04:05:21.779 align:start position:0%
teach so migrid's in short are subsets
 
04:05:23.929 --> 04:05:23.939 align:start position:0%
of the electrical system that can be
 
04:05:28.729 --> 04:05:28.739 align:start position:0%
isolated or islanded to preserve and
 
04:05:31.429 --> 04:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
protect the supply of electricity within
 
04:05:32.929 --> 04:05:32.939 align:start position:0%
the island
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
and when there's no need for islanding
 
04:05:37.790 --> 04:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
they can be part of the
 
04:05:39.650 --> 04:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
um the larger grid
 
04:05:43.070 --> 04:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
okay and uh Peter in his testimony
 
04:05:46.189 --> 04:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
provided a definition from the U.S
 
04:05:48.290 --> 04:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
04:05:50.510 --> 04:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
um which I imagine
 
04:05:52.370 --> 04:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
um he will refer to when he comes back
 
04:05:56.090 --> 04:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
so back to my testimony where I uh
 
04:05:58.370 --> 04:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
described the Delights of Princeton
 
04:06:00.889 --> 04:06:00.899 align:start position:0%
University's survival in the face of
 
04:06:04.849 --> 04:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
disaster and uh support the notion that
 
04:06:06.830 --> 04:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
this would be a very good idea in New
 
04:06:09.769 --> 04:06:09.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire particularly for disasters as
 
04:06:12.290 --> 04:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
with climate crisis impending we're
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to see more floods we're going to
 
04:06:16.969 --> 04:06:16.979 align:start position:0%
see more wildfires we're going to see
 
04:06:19.729 --> 04:06:19.739 align:start position:0%
more heavy precipitation events which
 
04:06:21.729 --> 04:06:21.739 align:start position:0%
lead to communities being cut off
 
04:06:26.809 --> 04:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
sometimes losing both uh their access to
 
04:06:29.389 --> 04:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
lights water in the wintertime that can
 
04:06:31.130 --> 04:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
be heat in the summertime it can be air
 
04:06:31.140 --> 04:06:32.689 align:start position:0%
be heat in the summertime it can be air
conditioning

04:06:32.689 --> 04:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
conditioning
 
04:06:35.330 --> 04:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
for medical centers loss of electricity
 
04:06:40.370 --> 04:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:42.710 --> 04:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
in the Town of Plainfield where I live a
 
04:06:44.689 --> 04:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
microgrid could easily be established
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
which would connect our emergency
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
services our fire police our town
 
04:06:53.210 --> 04:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
offices with our our elementary school
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
which can serve as an emergency shelter
 
04:06:58.010 --> 04:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
we have one store in town it could also
 
04:07:01.550 --> 04:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
be on a very small isolated Loop no more
 
04:07:03.769 --> 04:07:03.779 align:start position:0%
than five miles in length
 
04:07:06.050 --> 04:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that we could have
 
04:07:08.030 --> 04:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
access to the silver array at the school
 
04:07:09.950 --> 04:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
we also have Kimball Union Academy
 
04:07:13.610 --> 04:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
within that Loop which has wind power as
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
well as solar power we could be a an
 
04:07:18.650 --> 04:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
access area for surrounding communities
 
04:07:22.189 --> 04:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
to come to in an emergency situation so
 
04:07:24.670 --> 04:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
in short micro grids can be life-saving
 
04:07:27.710 --> 04:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
the military uses them extensively to
 
04:07:31.309 --> 04:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
cut off a base to protect its Supply and
 
04:07:34.969 --> 04:07:34.979 align:start position:0%
also for cyber security reasons
 
04:07:38.110 --> 04:07:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:41.929 --> 04:07:41.939 align:start position:0%
I think that's about
 
04:07:44.210 --> 04:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
no the question that you asked me uh
 
04:07:45.530 --> 04:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
chairman Bose I knew there was something
 
04:07:48.050 --> 04:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
else I was supposed to get to why have a
 
04:07:50.809 --> 04:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
study committee when there's a grid mod
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
well gridma has been going on for five
 
04:07:53.040 --> 04:07:53.990 align:start position:0%
well gridma has been going on for five
years

04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
and we're not getting any closer
 
04:08:00.410 --> 04:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
so I I think that this this is something
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
that we can do in a short term but it is
 
04:08:05.929 --> 04:08:05.939 align:start position:0%
complicated as so many of the issues
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
that come before this committee are and
 
04:08:10.370 --> 04:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
getting having an opportunity for
 
04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to work together to bring
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
the utilities in I'm sure there are
 
04:08:17.210 --> 04:08:17.220 align:start position:0%
reasons why in some areas it's difficult
 
04:08:20.809 --> 04:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
to Island a segment of the grid
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
um we need to understand what what that
 
04:08:25.849 --> 04:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
means would there be a need for State
 
04:08:28.570 --> 04:08:28.580 align:start position:0%
investment would there be a need for
 
04:08:31.729 --> 04:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
other other measures that could make it
 
04:08:35.150 --> 04:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
possible for towns to have access to
 
04:08:37.729 --> 04:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
this life-saving technology and I'll
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:49.309 --> 04:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:53.809 --> 04:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:56.330 --> 04:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas is recognized for
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh thank you for
 
04:09:01.729 --> 04:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:09:03.950 --> 04:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
um my only question is
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
I seem to have remembered that a bill
 
04:09:09.530 --> 04:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
like this was submitted before not
 
04:09:12.469 --> 04:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
tomorrow maybe the last couple years
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
um can you refresh my memory if this is
 
04:09:16.969 --> 04:09:16.979 align:start position:0%
the same type of Bill or is there
 
04:09:18.110 --> 04:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
something different because something
 
04:09:20.809 --> 04:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
didn't get done or what was the impetus
 
04:09:23.090 --> 04:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
behind this this particular committee
 
04:09:23.100 --> 04:09:24.309 align:start position:0%
behind this this particular committee
bill

04:09:24.309 --> 04:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:09:27.769 --> 04:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
excellent question I I do recall that we
 
04:09:31.070 --> 04:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
had a prior bill on microgrids and as I
 
04:09:33.950 --> 04:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
recall I did not research this prior to
 
04:09:36.530 --> 04:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
our hearing as I recall it was merged
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
with another bill that was on a somewhat
 
04:09:43.450 --> 04:09:43.460 align:start position:0%
related subject
 
04:09:47.450 --> 04:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
and that's about as far as my memory is
 
04:09:49.849 --> 04:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
taking me
 
04:09:52.250 --> 04:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
um does anyone else on the committee who
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
was here in the last session recall what
 
04:09:57.410 --> 04:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
happened with that bill was it rolled
 
04:10:00.229 --> 04:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
into an Omnibus or
 
04:10:03.349 --> 04:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
you know I perhaps uh the the sponsor
 
04:10:07.250 --> 04:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
when he does arrive I will recall
 
04:10:09.469 --> 04:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
because I believe he may well have been
 
04:10:14.809 --> 04:10:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:19.610 --> 04:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chair uh and uh
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
and can you also verify it's kind of
 
04:10:25.370 --> 04:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
fuzzy but I I thought that bill did pass
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
our committee at the time uh to remember
 
04:10:29.870 --> 04:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
if it did and then it got emerged
 
04:10:32.330 --> 04:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
04:10:35.689 --> 04:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
I believe we merged it and it passed our
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
committee but that's my recollection and
 
04:10:44.510 --> 04:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:48.530 --> 04:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you my recollection is that uh
 
04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
the bill was merged with some
 
04:10:55.010 --> 04:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill from the Senate that got
 
04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
vetoed and the veto was sustained that's
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
my memory but I could it could be wrong
 
04:11:02.510 --> 04:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
but I think that's the reason we see it
 
04:11:04.309 --> 04:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
again here well if it got that far it
 
04:11:05.809 --> 04:11:05.819 align:start position:0%
must have come out of our committee with
 
04:11:10.490 --> 04:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
a positive recommendation yeah I think
 
04:11:10.500 --> 04:11:12.290 align:start position:0%
a positive recommendation yeah I think
okay

04:11:12.290 --> 04:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:11:14.330 --> 04:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:11:16.370 --> 04:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
Bernardi for a question
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
04:11:23.090 --> 04:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative remember to speak loudly
 
04:11:28.130 --> 04:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
I I would like more detail on why this
 
04:11:31.550 --> 04:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
bill is necessary uh given the grid
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
modernization program
 
04:11:36.170 --> 04:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned that it's going on but
 
04:11:39.769 --> 04:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
you didn't say what specifically this is
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
going to do what the timing of this is
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
going to be as over the grid
 
04:11:44.880 --> 04:11:47.990 align:start position:0%
going to be as over the grid
modernization

04:11:47.990 --> 04:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:52.080 --> 04:11:53.769 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:11:53.769 --> 04:11:53.779 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:11:57.290 --> 04:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
two two questions the first one is why
 
04:11:59.689 --> 04:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
go ahead with this while grid mod is
 
04:12:02.510 --> 04:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
still proceeding and the second one was
 
04:12:06.110 --> 04:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
um are we duplicating efforts uh highly
 
04:12:08.389 --> 04:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
related yeah
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
so the problem with grid mod is that
 
04:12:16.550 --> 04:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's an enormous issue with you know and
 
04:12:18.370 --> 04:12:18.380 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong here cat
 
04:12:22.309 --> 04:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
hundreds of interlocking interwoven
 
04:12:25.969 --> 04:12:25.979 align:start position:0%
moving parts and there are many actors
 
04:12:29.750 --> 04:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
who have a stake in not going forward
 
04:12:32.210 --> 04:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
with one element here or one element
 
04:12:35.090 --> 04:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
there so that this particular technology
 
04:12:38.750 --> 04:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
is being held hostage even though it has
 
04:12:41.450 --> 04:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
broad support
 
04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and yeah that's that's really the
 
04:12:46.490 --> 04:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
point this has broad support it's being
 
04:12:48.769 --> 04:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
held hostage to other things which are
 
04:12:51.110 --> 04:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
much more controversial and this was
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
seen as a way to there's no necessity
 
04:12:57.889 --> 04:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
for it to wait for everything to go
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
forward it can be it can be islanded it
 
04:13:04.809 --> 04:13:04.819 align:start position:0%
can be segregated from that entire
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
revamping and re-understanding and
 
04:13:10.870 --> 04:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
recasting of how electricity is provided
 
04:13:15.769 --> 04:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:21.950 --> 04:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:29.210 --> 04:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.689 --> 04:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:34.510 --> 04:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
it was raised before some of the other
 
04:13:36.889 --> 04:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
hands that I see raised I'm going to
 
04:13:40.429 --> 04:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
call on The Honorable march shepherdson
 
04:13:45.110 --> 04:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:47.570 --> 04:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman
 
04:13:50.030 --> 04:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
I just um I remember talking about this
 
04:13:51.650 --> 04:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
a few years ago
 
04:13:55.070 --> 04:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
and um everyone seems to agree that it's
 
04:13:57.290 --> 04:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
a a good thing to have that you should
 
04:13:58.849 --> 04:13:58.859 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
04:14:01.370 --> 04:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
have some place like Princeton or a
 
04:14:05.150 --> 04:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
small town center separate itself during
 
04:14:07.849 --> 04:14:07.859 align:start position:0%
times of Crisis especially and that it
 
04:14:11.090 --> 04:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
can be a great asset to that town or
 
04:14:12.969 --> 04:14:12.979 align:start position:0%
that college or whatever
 
04:14:15.729 --> 04:14:15.739 align:start position:0%
entity has done this
 
04:14:18.110 --> 04:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
provides safety much in the same way
 
04:14:20.330 --> 04:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
that homeowners can have a generator in
 
04:14:23.450 --> 04:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
their garage this would be a way to say
 
04:14:25.670 --> 04:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
well if we need to we can separate
 
04:14:27.110 --> 04:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves from the grid and still
 
04:14:28.910 --> 04:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
provide Power
 
04:14:31.010 --> 04:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
I don't see why we would not go forward
 
04:14:33.769 --> 04:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
knowing that as representative oxenham
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
said it's it's part of a larger bill
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
that has other more controversial pieces
 
04:14:41.630 --> 04:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
it's not getting dealt with on an
 
04:14:43.849 --> 04:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
untimely manner why would we not go
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
forward with this I strongly urge you to
 
04:14:48.349 --> 04:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
do this thank you
 
04:14:50.870 --> 04:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
I should point out to new members that
 
04:14:53.090 --> 04:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh former representative Marge
 
04:14:54.889 --> 04:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
shepardson served with great Distinction
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
on science technology and energy for for
 
04:14:59.689 --> 04:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
many years and thank you very much for
 
04:15:02.510 --> 04:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
the call in Marge and I agree why not
 
04:15:05.090 --> 04:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
this is this is an opportunity to do
 
04:15:08.510 --> 04:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
something and uh we can we can really
 
04:15:10.570 --> 04:15:10.580 align:start position:0%
make a contribution to our communities
 
04:15:13.370 --> 04:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
that I think we can all take home and
 
04:15:18.290 --> 04:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:20.450 --> 04:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
I thank you as well
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%

and
 
04:16:14.150 --> 04:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
what we want to do and that it should
 
04:16:16.849 --> 04:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
move forward under even a federal
 
04:16:19.490 --> 04:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
Administration and I'm going to follow
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
that with do you remember the ice storm
 
04:16:25.969 --> 04:16:25.979 align:start position:0%
that we had where people were weeks
 
04:16:29.630 --> 04:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
without power and that also means that I
 
04:16:31.370 --> 04:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
found out the hard way
 
04:16:34.189 --> 04:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
can't go to the gas pump if there's no
 
04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
electricity so I I just wondered if you
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
felt maybe there could be a connection
 
04:16:40.319 --> 04:16:41.570 align:start position:0%
felt maybe there could be a connection
there

04:16:41.570 --> 04:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:16:44.269 --> 04:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
between Homeland Security and and
 
04:16:44.279 --> 04:16:46.309 align:start position:0%
between Homeland Security and and
planning

04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
planning
 
04:16:49.610 --> 04:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you um for that other question I
 
04:16:51.410 --> 04:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
certainly do remember the ice storm it
 
04:16:53.570 --> 04:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
was difficult here too we had
 
04:16:56.450 --> 04:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
people from all over town going down to
 
04:16:58.250 --> 04:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
Main Street to The Community House the
 
04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
only place around that had power so they
 
04:17:02.809 --> 04:17:02.819 align:start position:0%
could charge their phones and get water
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
to drink and so forth so it was
 
04:17:07.849 --> 04:17:07.859 align:start position:0%
difficult and uh
 
04:17:07.859 --> 04:17:09.110 align:start position:0%
difficult and uh
I

04:17:09.110 --> 04:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:17:11.210 --> 04:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
don't know about linking it in with
 
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security I would think it would
 
04:17:16.370 --> 04:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
be a logical uh discussion to have
 
04:17:19.849 --> 04:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
it's certainly um a safety issue in my
 
04:17:19.859 --> 04:17:21.769 align:start position:0%
it's certainly um a safety issue in my
mind

04:17:21.769 --> 04:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
mind
 
04:17:25.610 --> 04:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
if I could also try to answer the a part
 
04:17:28.870 --> 04:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
of that with the
 
04:17:31.309 --> 04:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
large-scale Federal funding that's going
 
04:17:33.189 --> 04:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
to be coming available
 
04:17:36.290 --> 04:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
oxenham I didn't recognize you to speak
 
04:17:39.889 --> 04:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
I the the question
 
04:17:42.170 --> 04:17:42.180 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
04:17:45.229 --> 04:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chair the question was originally for
 
04:17:45.239 --> 04:17:47.330 align:start position:0%
Mr chair the question was originally for
Lee

04:17:47.330 --> 04:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
Lee
 
04:17:49.309 --> 04:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
I I didn't think we were asking
 
04:17:52.309 --> 04:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
questions with the public so
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
my fault didn't think we were either but
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
I let you
 
04:18:01.189 --> 04:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
check for you may I
 
04:18:03.769 --> 04:18:03.779 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
04:18:05.990 --> 04:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham I'll get back to
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
you in just a second
 
04:18:10.370 --> 04:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative partial has been waiting
 
04:18:12.110 --> 04:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
to ask a question I want to recognize
 
04:18:12.120 --> 04:18:12.950 align:start position:0%
to ask a question I want to recognize
him

04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
him
 
04:18:15.530 --> 04:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
well again I'll be glad to defer if uh
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
this is the following a line of
 
04:18:24.370 --> 04:18:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:24.380 --> 04:18:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
speaking

04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
04:18:28.250 --> 04:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
um yes I'm no expert on homeland
 
04:18:33.830 --> 04:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
Security's jurisdiction however I do
 
04:18:35.510 --> 04:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
know that there are going to be
 
04:18:38.330 --> 04:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
substantial federal funds available if
 
04:18:40.250 --> 04:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
the bill currently before the Congress
 
04:18:45.050 --> 04:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
is indeed passed out and they may well
 
04:18:47.929 --> 04:18:47.939 align:start position:0%
um have we here in New Hampshire our
 
04:18:50.269 --> 04:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
towns and municipalities May well have
 
04:18:53.530 --> 04:18:53.540 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to have
 
04:18:56.269 --> 04:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
investments in things which relate to
 
04:18:58.849 --> 04:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security and disaster
 
04:19:02.330 --> 04:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
preparedness and uh recovery from
 
04:19:05.389 --> 04:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
disasters because if we have something
 
04:19:07.849 --> 04:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
that's as they call it shovel ready to
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
the extent that we would have a bill
 
04:19:12.349 --> 04:19:12.359 align:start position:0%
that we could get through and towns
 
04:19:15.889 --> 04:19:15.899 align:start position:0%
could be working on actual plans when
 
04:19:18.290 --> 04:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
those monies are made available that
 
04:19:20.510 --> 04:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
they're looking for places to be put to
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
work when I was in Baltimore I was
 
04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
working on dam removal and we had a damn
 
04:19:28.250 --> 04:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
that we were all ready to go but there
 
04:19:31.969 --> 04:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
was no funding when 2008 2009 happened
 
04:19:33.610 --> 04:19:33.620 align:start position:0%
and they were looking for shovel ready
 
04:19:36.769 --> 04:19:36.779 align:start position:0%
projects boom that Dam went to the front
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
of the line and it was removed so I
 
04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
think we have an opportunity here to to
 
04:19:44.929 --> 04:19:44.939 align:start position:0%
do things that could save our taxpayers
 
04:19:48.050 --> 04:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
money by being available for the federal
 
04:19:51.170 --> 04:19:51.180 align:start position:0%
funding and by linking microgrids as
 
04:19:53.570 --> 04:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
they well should be to issues of
 
04:19:56.450 --> 04:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
disaster preparedness and uh Homeland
 
04:19:56.460 --> 04:19:58.189 align:start position:0%
disaster preparedness and uh Homeland
Security

04:19:58.189 --> 04:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
Security
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Lee
 
04:20:02.090 --> 04:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative partial you're
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
now recognized for what thank you so
 
04:20:07.070 --> 04:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
much I appreciate that chair
 
04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
um I am looking at a letter here and we
 
04:20:10.250 --> 04:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
were speaking about letters of support
 
04:20:12.290 --> 04:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
before and this is from New Hamburg
 
04:20:15.110 --> 04:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
Timberland Owners Association in support
 
04:20:16.729 --> 04:20:16.739 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I'm the only one who
 
04:20:20.210 --> 04:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
have received this though
 
04:20:21.889 --> 04:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
why this would like that included with
 
04:20:28.490 --> 04:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:30.290 --> 04:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
testimonies it was
 
04:20:31.630 --> 04:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
it was several different
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
simultaneously yeah it was yeah
 
04:20:38.330 --> 04:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
yeah my error and not including it
 
04:20:38.340 --> 04:20:39.469 align:start position:0%
yeah my error and not including it
okay

04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:20:42.830 --> 04:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh I also have a observation I
 
04:20:44.630 --> 04:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
guess you'd say
 
04:20:44.640 --> 04:20:45.410 align:start position:0%
guess you'd say
um

04:20:45.410 --> 04:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:47.150 --> 04:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I don't believe even
 
04:20:50.269 --> 04:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
have a legal definition of what concepts
 
04:20:52.610 --> 04:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
a micro grid and I can see where that
 
04:20:55.010 --> 04:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
could contribute to uncertainty about uh
 
04:20:57.050 --> 04:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
innovators who want to get into uh
 
04:20:59.389 --> 04:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
microgrid who
 
04:21:01.729 --> 04:21:01.739 align:start position:0%
uh who are fearful of What legislation
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
may be enacted after the fact they're in
 
04:21:05.510 --> 04:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
it so I would think that nothing else a
 
04:21:07.910 --> 04:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
study group would allow us to establish
 
04:21:10.250 --> 04:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
what constitutes a micro Grid in New
 
04:21:12.229 --> 04:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is why you support this
 
04:21:12.239 --> 04:21:13.670 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is why you support this
bill

04:21:13.670 --> 04:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:21:16.070 --> 04:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:21:18.650 --> 04:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:21:18.660 --> 04:21:19.370 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
um

04:21:19.370 --> 04:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:22.130 --> 04:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
on the issue of written testimony I have
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
to let you all know that David Muse who
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
is about to be recognized to speak did
 
04:21:32.090 --> 04:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony about
 
04:21:34.849 --> 04:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
a half hour ago so that it should be in
 
04:21:37.389 --> 04:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
your inbox when you get a chance to
 
04:21:40.189 --> 04:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
Peru's said inbox
 
04:21:42.170 --> 04:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
so with that I would like to now
 
04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
recognize uh representative David Muse
 
04:21:54.650 --> 04:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
04:21:58.910 --> 04:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm going to be
 
04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
brief because I realized the purpose of
 
04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
this hearing uh is to determine whether
 
04:22:05.750 --> 04:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
or not to form a study committee and not
 
04:22:09.469 --> 04:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
to actually start the study itself
 
04:22:11.689 --> 04:22:11.699 align:start position:0%
um I'm basically supporting this bill
 
04:22:14.570 --> 04:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
because like the rest of us I live in a
 
04:22:16.969 --> 04:22:16.979 align:start position:0%
state that doesn't have any oil well
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have any coal mines we don't
 
04:22:22.250 --> 04:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
have any natural gas fields and for the
 
04:22:23.929 --> 04:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
most part I think we find ourselves
 
04:22:26.150 --> 04:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
completely at the mercy of other states
 
04:22:28.969 --> 04:22:28.979 align:start position:0%
when it comes to our energy supplies and
 
04:22:30.910 --> 04:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
especially the supplies of fossil fuels
 
04:22:33.889 --> 04:22:33.899 align:start position:0%
we learned a very hard lesson back in
 
04:22:36.650 --> 04:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
the 1970s that Supply shocks are not
 
04:22:39.410 --> 04:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
only possible they're extremely probable
 
04:22:41.090 --> 04:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
in a world where much of our energy
 
04:22:43.490 --> 04:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
Supply needs to travel very long
 
04:22:46.250 --> 04:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
distances to actually get here to New
 
04:22:46.260 --> 04:22:47.990 align:start position:0%
distances to actually get here to New
Hampshire

04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:22:49.130 --> 04:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
um according to one of the better
 
04:22:51.370 --> 04:22:51.380 align:start position:0%
definitions that I've seen
 
04:22:54.410 --> 04:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
microgrids are basically self-contained
 
04:22:56.210 --> 04:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
electrical grids that can operate as an
 
04:22:58.370 --> 04:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
Island Independent of a central power
 
04:22:58.380 --> 04:22:59.750 align:start position:0%
Island Independent of a central power
grid

04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
grid
 
04:23:02.150 --> 04:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
um in communities like mine uh
 
04:23:04.729 --> 04:23:04.739 align:start position:0%
microgrids are intriguing
 
04:23:09.050 --> 04:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
um we have a downtown area uh that it
 
04:23:11.210 --> 04:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful if there was a way to
 
04:23:14.150 --> 04:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh essentially protect and preserve the
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
ability of our businesses to operate in
 
04:23:20.030 --> 04:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
a natural disaster that's that's where
 
04:23:22.130 --> 04:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
um that's where a lot of our downtown
 
04:23:24.650 --> 04:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
area fuels much of our economy and
 
04:23:27.710 --> 04:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
growth we have a huge area of medical
 
04:23:29.450 --> 04:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
centers over near Portsmouth Hospital
 
04:23:31.849 --> 04:23:31.859 align:start position:0%
not only in the hospital itself but
 
04:23:33.530 --> 04:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
there is there are a slew of different
 
04:23:36.349 --> 04:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh Medical Office Buildings uh and it's
 
04:23:39.110 --> 04:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
extremely important uh that uh that
 
04:23:42.410 --> 04:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
those facilities uh uh you know have an
 
04:23:45.050 --> 04:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
under uninterrupted power supply I think
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
it's also extremely important because as
 
04:23:51.110 --> 04:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have those uh those coal mines
 
04:23:52.969 --> 04:23:52.979 align:start position:0%
and those cast fields and things like
 
04:23:54.830 --> 04:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
that what we do have is a renewable
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
energy business uh in in New Hampshire
 
04:23:59.870 --> 04:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh we have people who are in the
 
04:24:02.269 --> 04:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
business of providing wind energy and
 
04:24:04.189 --> 04:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
solar energy
 
04:24:07.130 --> 04:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
um and while microgrids can actually be
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
made up completely of fossil fuel
 
04:24:09.600 --> 04:24:11.150 align:start position:0%
made up completely of fossil fuel
producers

04:24:11.150 --> 04:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
producers
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
um much of the attraction is the fact
 
04:24:16.790 --> 04:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
that they can also be made up of folks
 
04:24:18.849 --> 04:24:18.859 align:start position:0%
who are producing renewable energy
 
04:24:21.950 --> 04:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
which saves greenhouse gases and and
 
04:24:24.229 --> 04:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
solves a bunch of other problems they
 
04:24:26.330 --> 04:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
also help solve the issue of loss of
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
power along long transmission lines and
 
04:24:32.030 --> 04:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
I think representative partial raised a
 
04:24:35.269 --> 04:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
a great uh issue when he when he noted
 
04:24:37.550 --> 04:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
that we don't even have a legal
 
04:24:39.469 --> 04:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
definition of what a micro grid is in
 
04:24:41.389 --> 04:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:24:43.370 --> 04:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
um according to the Center for uh
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
climate and Energy Solutions uh there
 
04:24:47.689 --> 04:24:47.699 align:start position:0%
are other legal barriers that states
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
like our space
 
04:24:52.670 --> 04:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
um including laws that might limit uh or
 
04:24:55.610 --> 04:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
prohibit specific activities
 
04:24:58.130 --> 04:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
um laws that might increase the cost of
 
04:25:00.590 --> 04:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
doing business online uh for for those
 
04:25:03.050 --> 04:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
trying to create micro grids
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
um and also there's just the uncertainty
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
that anyone who goes ahead and tries to
 
04:25:10.849 --> 04:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
implement one of these things might
 
04:25:13.070 --> 04:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
actually find restrictions imposed on
 
04:25:15.370 --> 04:25:15.380 align:start position:0%
them in additional costs imposed later
 
04:25:17.870 --> 04:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
once we get our act together and figure
 
04:25:19.969 --> 04:25:19.979 align:start position:0%
out exactly what we want to do with
 
04:25:21.889 --> 04:25:21.899 align:start position:0%
microgrids and and how we want to
 
04:25:24.769 --> 04:25:24.779 align:start position:0%
regulate and how we promote them so I
 
04:25:26.929 --> 04:25:26.939 align:start position:0%
think the study committee would be a
 
04:25:29.809 --> 04:25:29.819 align:start position:0%
great way to get the bulb rolling to
 
04:25:32.330 --> 04:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
educate the legislature and to also
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
educate members of the public about how
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
we can benefit from this solution
 
04:25:39.889 --> 04:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:25:45.290 --> 04:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
I assume Representative Sam said that
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
you're not you're raised hand is not to
 
04:25:49.790 --> 04:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
ask a question but just to notify us
 
04:25:52.370 --> 04:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
that you are back in the in the meeting
 
04:25:55.610 --> 04:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
that is correct Mr chairman yes okay
 
04:25:59.710 --> 04:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for uh
 
04:26:04.910 --> 04:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:07.490 --> 04:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will turn the floor over
 
04:26:10.250 --> 04:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
to representative samsich so that he can
 
04:26:16.189 --> 04:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:19.030 --> 04:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman uh
 
04:26:21.830 --> 04:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
obviously since I wasn't here to listen
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
to what other people have said uh I
 
04:26:26.570 --> 04:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
might be repeating a couple things but I
 
04:26:29.330 --> 04:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
just have a few brief oral uh comments
 
04:26:31.729 --> 04:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
uh you've already received received a
 
04:26:34.670 --> 04:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
testimony from me and you can take a
 
04:26:36.769 --> 04:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
look at that but this is just very
 
04:26:36.779 --> 04:26:38.330 align:start position:0%
look at that but this is just very
briefly

04:26:38.330 --> 04:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
04:26:40.490 --> 04:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
um just as a comment about the
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
definition of microgrids it is correct
 
04:26:44.689 --> 04:26:44.699 align:start position:0%
that we don't have one here in New
 
04:26:46.990 --> 04:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now however
 
04:26:49.849 --> 04:26:49.859 align:start position:0%
military bases such as the Portsmouth
 
04:26:52.790 --> 04:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
Naval Shipyard have been microgrids for
 
04:26:55.370 --> 04:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
a long time they can operate on their
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
own even when the grid goes down that's
 
04:26:59.630 --> 04:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
one of the requirements that they've
 
04:27:01.309 --> 04:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
they've hardened their their energy
 
04:27:05.450 --> 04:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
Supply and right now UNH is working
 
04:27:07.790 --> 04:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
together with eversource and some other
 
04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
utilities to create a micro grid for the
 
04:27:14.210 --> 04:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire so that's
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
just two examples of what's going on
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
right right now in New Hampshire
 
04:27:21.229 --> 04:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:27:23.870 --> 04:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
I think in addition to providing the
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
larger municipalities in our town a way
 
04:27:28.070 --> 04:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
to incorporate some of their local
 
04:27:31.130 --> 04:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
energy generation into a system that
 
04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
provides local citizens and with local
 
04:27:38.090 --> 04:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
power at an attractive cost even smaller
 
04:27:41.269 --> 04:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
towns could be considered can consider a
 
04:27:43.309 --> 04:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
Cooperative microgrid with neighboring
 
04:27:45.710 --> 04:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
communities that would offer more
 
04:27:47.570 --> 04:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
economic opportunities for all
 
04:27:51.110 --> 04:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities involved a more resilient
 
04:27:53.630 --> 04:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
and a more reliable power system in the
 
04:27:56.149 --> 04:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
case of weather events and a way to
 
04:27:58.490 --> 04:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
control the town's energy costs in the
 
04:28:01.250 --> 04:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
future as was mentioned before uh
 
04:28:03.710 --> 04:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
microvision contain both fossil fuel
 
04:28:05.450 --> 04:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
generation and renewable energy
 
04:28:09.290 --> 04:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
generation so uh as as that grid
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
develops one replaces equipment with
 
04:28:14.830 --> 04:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
another and also uh
 
04:28:17.809 --> 04:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
adjacent communities can decide that
 
04:28:19.849 --> 04:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
they don't need all the backup power
 
04:28:21.530 --> 04:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
they have in case of
 
04:28:23.030 --> 04:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
urgency but they could help each other
 
04:28:26.630 --> 04:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
out if they need backup power by re
 
04:28:29.050 --> 04:28:29.060 align:start position:0%
removing some redundancies
 
04:28:31.910 --> 04:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh but both small and large communities
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
would benefit if we could figure out
 
04:28:37.429 --> 04:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
what what areas benefit a small versus a
 
04:28:39.769 --> 04:28:39.779 align:start position:0%
larger town and identify those and
 
04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of a study
 
04:28:44.269 --> 04:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
and remember microgrids are operating
 
04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
behind the meter so basically uh they
 
04:28:52.550 --> 04:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
are reducing Demand on the primary grid
 
04:28:54.710 --> 04:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
and therefore they're reducing the need
 
04:28:57.110 --> 04:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
for additional expensive Transportation
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
transmission infrastructure
 
04:29:02.090 --> 04:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
so these would be savings that all
 
04:29:04.670 --> 04:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
customers of a particular utility would
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
benefit by and even the whole state of
 
04:29:08.689 --> 04:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so thank you very much
 
04:29:10.429 --> 04:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
those are the only comments I have and
 
04:29:14.689 --> 04:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:14.699 --> 04:29:17.630 align:start position:0%
 
for

04:29:17.630 --> 04:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:29:17.640 --> 04:29:20.330 align:start position:0%
for
such

04:29:20.330 --> 04:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:22.849 --> 04:29:22.859 align:start position:0%
representative Sanchez can you describe
 
04:29:25.610 --> 04:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
to us or explain to us what is the
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
difference between a micro grid
 
04:29:34.330 --> 04:29:34.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:36.590 --> 04:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman for that
 
04:29:38.330 --> 04:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
question I think that's an outstanding
 
04:29:41.689 --> 04:29:41.699 align:start position:0%
question uh and I think uh part of the
 
04:29:43.550 --> 04:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
problem with not defining what a
 
04:29:46.189 --> 04:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
microgrid is is that you probably don't
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
want to Define it too too rigorously uh
 
04:29:52.849 --> 04:29:52.859 align:start position:0%
for example in um in the in Brooklyn New
 
04:29:55.849 --> 04:29:55.859 align:start position:0%
York uh uh several streets got together
 
04:29:59.809 --> 04:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
to create a solar microgrid where some
 
04:30:01.969 --> 04:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
of the residents had solar installations
 
04:30:04.610 --> 04:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
on their roofs and others didn't but
 
04:30:06.889 --> 04:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
that Community got together to invest in
 
04:30:09.710 --> 04:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
putting those solar energy on the roofs
 
04:30:11.809 --> 04:30:11.819 align:start position:0%
and now they're sharing both the
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
benefits and the costs so as far as net
 
04:30:16.849 --> 04:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
metering is concerned
 
04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
um I think that is exactly the kind of
 
04:30:21.050 --> 04:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
issues that need to be worked out with a
 
04:30:23.870 --> 04:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
utility because the utilities have to be
 
04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
part of anything such as a microgrid uh
 
04:30:30.590 --> 04:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
and in fact maybe they are the ones on
 
04:30:33.110 --> 04:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
contract operating the microgrid for a
 
04:30:35.330 --> 04:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
community so I think those are
 
04:30:38.210 --> 04:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
unresolved issues but they are important
 
04:30:40.490 --> 04:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
ones and that's exactly why I think a
 
04:30:44.870 --> 04:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:44.880 --> 04:30:47.689 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
04:30:50.570 --> 04:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
representative assumptions yeah
 
04:30:54.349 --> 04:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
three years ago the stne committee went
 
04:30:57.980 --> 04:30:57.990 align:start position:0%
to UNH to look at their
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:59.450 align:start position:0%
to UNH to look at their

04:30:59.450 --> 04:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:31:01.370 --> 04:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
a power plant
 
04:31:03.380 --> 04:31:03.390 align:start position:0%
on the campus at unh
 
04:31:03.390 --> 04:31:04.570 align:start position:0%
on the campus at unh
[Music]

04:31:04.570 --> 04:31:04.580 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:31:06.590 --> 04:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
ired uh
 
04:31:11.330 --> 04:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:13.189 --> 04:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
I think I guess it was just gas but
 
04:31:13.199 --> 04:31:14.389 align:start position:0%
I think I guess it was just gas but
anyway

04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:31:14.399 --> 04:31:15.110 align:start position:0%
anyway
um

04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:17.929 --> 04:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
that's when we first learned about the
 
04:31:20.809 --> 04:31:20.819 align:start position:0%
the project to create a micro grid
 
04:31:24.590 --> 04:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh on the University campus and at that
 
04:31:28.250 --> 04:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
meeting we were told that uh part of the
 
04:31:31.250 --> 04:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
delay in making progress on creating
 
04:31:34.670 --> 04:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
that micro grid was the cost that was
 
04:31:37.370 --> 04:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive to create a micro
 
04:31:37.380 --> 04:31:38.469 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive to create a micro
grid

04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
grid
 
04:31:42.769 --> 04:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
you recall that discussion and do you
 
04:31:45.710 --> 04:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
remember why
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
it was reported to be costing so much to
 
04:31:50.570 --> 04:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
create that microgram
 
04:31:52.550 --> 04:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman for that
 
04:31:56.210 --> 04:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
question uh I was also on that tour as
 
04:31:59.809 --> 04:31:59.819 align:start position:0%
you mentioned and um I don't recall that
 
04:32:02.090 --> 04:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
specific discussion at least not very
 
04:32:02.100 --> 04:32:03.769 align:start position:0%
specific discussion at least not very
clearly

04:32:03.769 --> 04:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
04:32:06.290 --> 04:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
um and if you know if you're a member of
 
04:32:08.630 --> 04:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
the the gas that they were getting at
 
04:32:10.670 --> 04:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
UNH was coming actually from the
 
04:32:13.849 --> 04:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
landfill it was landfill gas otherwise
 
04:32:17.750 --> 04:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
referred to often as a renewable natural
 
04:32:17.760 --> 04:32:18.710 align:start position:0%
referred to often as a renewable natural
gas

04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
gas
 
04:32:21.189 --> 04:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
and uh so
 
04:32:23.929 --> 04:32:23.939 align:start position:0%
yeah well yeah it's methane but it came
 
04:32:26.090 --> 04:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
not from a pipeline somewhere it came
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
from their landfill
 
04:32:31.610 --> 04:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh and um so in addition to that I
 
04:32:33.830 --> 04:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
assumed that they also planned other
 
04:32:36.889 --> 04:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
measures including Energy Efficiency and
 
04:32:39.110 --> 04:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps other sources of energy
 
04:32:42.290 --> 04:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
generation and to be honest I haven't
 
04:32:44.450 --> 04:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
kept abreast of what the progress is
 
04:32:47.090 --> 04:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
there uh so I can't really report to you
 
04:32:51.769 --> 04:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
uh on that uh but um I'm sure you know
 
04:32:54.530 --> 04:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
um anything like this first of all it's
 
04:32:56.990 --> 04:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
a novel idea in New Hampshire and
 
04:32:57.000 --> 04:32:58.250 align:start position:0%
a novel idea in New Hampshire and
secondly

04:32:58.250 --> 04:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
04:33:01.849 --> 04:33:01.859 align:start position:0%
um you know uh the the The Upfront cost
 
04:33:05.029 --> 04:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
for something like this are are are not
 
04:33:07.910 --> 04:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh small however they do provide
 
04:33:10.730 --> 04:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
long-term benefits so I think the idea
 
04:33:13.789 --> 04:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
with UNH is that if they could incl
 
04:33:16.429 --> 04:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
create such a micro grid they will have
 
04:33:19.070 --> 04:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
more flexibility later on to integrate
 
04:33:21.410 --> 04:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
new sources and more efficient sources
 
04:33:23.631 --> 04:33:23.641 align:start position:0%
of energy that they can generate
 
04:33:27.609 --> 04:33:27.619 align:start position:0%
themselves uh in the form of solar or uh
 
04:33:30.289 --> 04:33:30.299 align:start position:0%
methane gas from landfill and so forth
 
04:33:33.650 --> 04:33:33.660 align:start position:0%
so I think these are really interesting
 
04:33:36.769 --> 04:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
ideas that need to be fleshed out and
 
04:33:39.410 --> 04:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
it's not the model that's used for UNH
 
04:33:40.849 --> 04:33:40.859 align:start position:0%
is a different model than let's say
 
04:33:43.369 --> 04:33:43.379 align:start position:0%
would be used up in the North Country if
 
04:33:45.410 --> 04:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
if a couple of small towns got together
 
04:33:47.869 --> 04:33:47.879 align:start position:0%
they would need other other ways of
 
04:33:51.170 --> 04:33:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:53.810 --> 04:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samcich for
 
04:33:57.170 --> 04:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
refreshing my memory that the UNH power
 
04:33:59.810 --> 04:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
plant gets regular natural gas from
 
04:34:03.410 --> 04:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
Unitil in addition to getting landfill
 
04:34:04.929 --> 04:34:04.939 align:start position:0%
gas from
 
04:34:08.269 --> 04:34:08.279 align:start position:0%
the big landfill of an upper history
 
04:34:11.869 --> 04:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
they have two different burners in their
 
04:34:14.390 --> 04:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
power plant yeah because the uh the
 
04:34:16.189 --> 04:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
methane they get from the
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
the landfill is actually cleaner and
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
purer than the natural gas they get from
 
04:34:26.090 --> 04:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:28.670 --> 04:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate your your memories of
 
04:34:30.769 --> 04:34:30.779 align:start position:0%
that trip unfortunately it was long
 
04:34:33.470 --> 04:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
enough ago that I don't have real clear
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
memories but it does seem to me that
 
04:34:39.470 --> 04:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
what UNH is doing constitutes a research
 
04:34:42.410 --> 04:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
project on microgrids
 
04:34:44.390 --> 04:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
and so that it would seem to me that
 
04:34:47.689 --> 04:34:47.699 align:start position:0%
there would be a lot to learn from what
 
04:34:50.631 --> 04:34:50.641 align:start position:0%
they are doing and presumably
 
04:34:52.490 --> 04:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
discovering as they try to implement
 
04:34:52.500 --> 04:34:53.810 align:start position:0%
discovering as they try to implement
this

04:34:53.810 --> 04:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:34:55.849 --> 04:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
okay are there any additional questions
 
04:34:55.859 --> 04:34:58.910 align:start position:0%
okay are there any additional questions
for

04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:01.730 --> 04:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative samsich I see none here
 
04:35:04.429 --> 04:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr chairman one more comment
 
04:35:04.439 --> 04:35:05.390 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr chairman one more comment
remember

04:35:05.390 --> 04:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:35:08.449 --> 04:35:08.459 align:start position:0%
uh one of the companies working on um
 
04:35:10.990 --> 04:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
with UNH is uh
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
TRC a a nationally renowned uh micros
 
04:35:18.170 --> 04:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
micro micro grid company that's actually
 
04:35:20.709 --> 04:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
has its headquarters here in Portsmouth
 
04:35:23.330 --> 04:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
so that we have some some local
 
04:35:25.070 --> 04:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
companies in New Hampshire that have
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
already created microgrids in other
 
04:35:30.650 --> 04:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:32.929 --> 04:35:32.939 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that reminder chair
 
04:35:36.109 --> 04:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
recognizes uh representative closure for
 
04:35:39.470 --> 04:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chairman thank
 
04:35:42.109 --> 04:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you representatives for your
 
04:35:44.330 --> 04:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
presentation speak loudly
 
04:35:47.051 --> 04:35:47.061 align:start position:0%
speak loudly
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
I was just about to ask that question if
 
04:35:54.590 --> 04:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
has any entities identified themselves
 
04:35:58.490 --> 04:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
in favor of the microgrid idea and
 
04:36:02.689 --> 04:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
opposed to it do you know of any
 
04:36:07.970 --> 04:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:10.369 --> 04:36:10.379 align:start position:0%
a question for me
 
04:36:13.730 --> 04:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.890 --> 04:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
um well
 
04:36:19.670 --> 04:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire like I said we don't
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
have really any good examples except UNH
 
04:36:25.310 --> 04:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
right now as as chairman mentioned it's
 
04:36:27.529 --> 04:36:27.539 align:start position:0%
more of a research project and it's very
 
04:36:29.170 --> 04:36:29.180 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do it at the University
 
04:36:33.949 --> 04:36:33.959 align:start position:0%
that has a lot of research uh asset so
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have any good examples in this
 
04:36:39.170 --> 04:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
in this state however uh the company TRC
 
04:36:42.170 --> 04:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned is creating a micro
 
04:36:45.410 --> 04:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
grid on Long Island in New York uh for a
 
04:36:48.830 --> 04:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
town of 50 000 residents uh and that's
 
04:36:51.289 --> 04:36:51.299 align:start position:0%
just one example of a project that
 
04:36:54.289 --> 04:36:54.299 align:start position:0%
they're working on Nationwide so there
 
04:36:57.590 --> 04:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
are many projects working uh and the met
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
and the incidentally the the thing I
 
04:37:02.689 --> 04:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
mentioned before with the Brooklyn solar
 
04:37:06.289 --> 04:37:06.299 align:start position:0%
solar energy microgrid uh they actually
 
04:37:10.010 --> 04:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
are using uh blockchain technology as a
 
04:37:12.650 --> 04:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
protection so they can accurately charge
 
04:37:15.830 --> 04:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
and and charge the price that they're
 
04:37:18.369 --> 04:37:18.379 align:start position:0%
gaining from solar to each each
 
04:37:22.010 --> 04:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
shareholder on that so this is a process
 
04:37:24.410 --> 04:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
that gives an opportunity to look at new
 
04:37:26.269 --> 04:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
technologies that can be incorporated
 
04:37:28.490 --> 04:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
but in New Hampshire we have very few
 
04:37:32.470 --> 04:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:35.689 --> 04:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
representative project a follow-up yes
 
04:37:38.810 --> 04:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on that
 
04:37:43.070 --> 04:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
um would not wouldn't not the microgrid
 
04:37:48.890 --> 04:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
work in unison with the existing RSA 53e
 
04:37:48.900 --> 04:37:50.810 align:start position:0%
work in unison with the existing RSA 53e

[Music]
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
Community power Aggregates if it makes
 
04:37:55.849 --> 04:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
its own power and can
 
04:37:57.769 --> 04:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
provide it
 
04:37:59.449 --> 04:37:59.459 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:01.849 --> 04:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I I think
 
04:38:04.250 --> 04:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
you're right I think there is there is a
 
04:38:07.250 --> 04:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
lot of synergy there and I see a a
 
04:38:09.890 --> 04:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
strong connection to that
 
04:38:09.900 --> 04:38:10.551 align:start position:0%
strong connection to that
um

04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:10.561 --> 04:38:12.170 align:start position:0%
um
uh

04:38:12.170 --> 04:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:38:12.180 --> 04:38:13.429 align:start position:0%
uh
so

04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
the part of the reason I suggested this
 
04:38:18.650 --> 04:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
study is to look at the elements we
 
04:38:20.810 --> 04:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
already have in in the state as far as
 
04:38:23.209 --> 04:38:23.219 align:start position:0%
legislation and to also see what
 
04:38:25.310 --> 04:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities there are in small and
 
04:38:28.189 --> 04:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
large communities and to come up with
 
04:38:30.529 --> 04:38:30.539 align:start position:0%
some ideas where things seem appropriate
 
04:38:32.810 --> 04:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
and where they might work so yeah I
 
04:38:36.551 --> 04:38:36.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:38.869 --> 04:38:38.879 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair recognizes
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Pitts for a
 
04:38:42.769 --> 04:38:42.779 align:start position:0%
question my question was going to be the
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
same what's the uh maybe a little tiny
 
04:38:47.109 --> 04:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
different what's the difference between
 
04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
Municipal energy Community energy and
 
04:38:57.289 --> 04:38:57.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:59.209 --> 04:38:59.219 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Kelly Pitts
 
04:39:01.609 --> 04:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
I agree with you
 
04:39:06.189 --> 04:39:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:09.410 --> 04:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative McGee is recognized for a
 
04:39:09.420 --> 04:39:13.490 align:start position:0%
representative McGee is recognized for a
question

04:39:13.490 --> 04:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:19.700 --> 04:39:19.710 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:19.710 --> 04:39:23.929 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:39:23.929 --> 04:39:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:26.269 --> 04:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong representative samsich but I
 
04:39:26.279 --> 04:39:27.170 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong representative samsich but I
think

04:39:27.170 --> 04:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:39:29.449 --> 04:39:29.459 align:start position:0%
concept of microgrids is around the
 
04:39:32.029 --> 04:39:32.039 align:start position:0%
concept of resiliency which is why the
 
04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
issue of security came up when we were
 
04:39:35.631 --> 04:39:35.641 align:start position:0%
first discussing it I'm not sure if you
 
04:39:37.610 --> 04:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
were back in the room at that time
 
04:39:39.708 --> 04:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the community power
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
piece is that people who want to invest
 
04:39:44.208 --> 04:39:44.218 align:start position:0%
individually will be able to pull their
 
04:39:45.890 --> 04:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
resources so that if they're all
 
04:39:48.890 --> 04:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
producing a little bit of energy they
 
04:39:51.230 --> 04:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
can be in some way pulled together so
 
04:39:53.868 --> 04:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
that they can leverage the benefits of
 
04:39:56.750 --> 04:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
the sum total of the energy that they're
 
04:39:59.530 --> 04:39:59.540 align:start position:0%
creating so that's my sort of Layman's
 
04:40:02.150 --> 04:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the distinctions
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
between the two it wouldn't be that you
 
04:40:08.390 --> 04:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't also have a bunch of small
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
plants that would be aggregated together
 
04:40:13.310 --> 04:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
but it's that the purpose and the design
 
04:40:15.770 --> 04:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
of the microgrid is that it be able to
 
04:40:19.970 --> 04:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
stand on its own if the if the utility
 
04:40:22.970 --> 04:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
grid was not available and I think that
 
04:40:24.288 --> 04:40:24.298 align:start position:0%
that's a distinction because I'm not
 
04:40:26.150 --> 04:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
sure that all the aggregators that are
 
04:40:27.770 --> 04:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
working in communities
 
04:40:31.130 --> 04:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
go into it with that particular end goal
 
04:40:32.810 --> 04:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
in mind so that I would see that as the
 
04:40:34.430 --> 04:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
distinction between those two and
 
04:40:36.288 --> 04:40:36.298 align:start position:0%
Municipal just means that the
 
04:40:37.730 --> 04:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
aggregation is being done at the Town
 
04:40:39.890 --> 04:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
level versus some other form of
 
04:40:39.900 --> 04:40:40.970 align:start position:0%
level versus some other form of
groupings

04:40:40.970 --> 04:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
groupings
 
04:40:43.610 --> 04:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
and that's how I that's how I try to
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
distinguish it and I just want to know
 
04:40:47.150 --> 04:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
if that's correct or if there's
 
04:40:48.890 --> 04:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
something else I don't understand
 
04:40:50.750 --> 04:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
no thank you thank you representative
 
04:40:53.690 --> 04:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
for that question and that that uh I
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
think that's a good clarification uh in
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
community power uh uh projects those
 
04:41:01.850 --> 04:41:01.860 align:start position:0%
could be projects that are are dependent
 
04:41:04.970 --> 04:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
on the grid and cannot disconnect from
 
04:41:07.250 --> 04:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
the grid uh but they're they're they're
 
04:41:10.788 --> 04:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
being operated uh as a separate entity
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
however they can't really Island
 
04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
themselves independently so that's
 
04:41:17.868 --> 04:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
probably the main distinction that you
 
04:41:19.850 --> 04:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
can do you can be independent of the
 
04:41:22.128 --> 04:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
Grid or you or you have to depend on the
 
04:41:22.138 --> 04:41:25.910 align:start position:0%
Grid or you or you have to depend on the
grid

04:41:25.910 --> 04:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:29.270 --> 04:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that answer
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative Lee
 
04:41:35.150 --> 04:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:38.208 --> 04:41:38.218 align:start position:0%
yes and on a similar line uh asking for
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
clarification Peter I think that notion
 
04:41:43.310 --> 04:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
of islanding is critical so group net
 
04:41:45.230 --> 04:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
metering also has nothing to do with
 
04:41:47.090 --> 04:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
being islanded from the Grid it's
 
04:41:49.250 --> 04:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
dependent upon using the grid am I
 
04:41:50.448 --> 04:41:50.458 align:start position:0%
correct there
 
04:41:53.390 --> 04:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I totally agree
 
04:41:57.788 --> 04:41:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:59.990 --> 04:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
I thought you were somebody else with
 
04:42:02.270 --> 04:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
their hand up but that doesn't appear to
 
04:42:03.948 --> 04:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
be the case
 
04:42:06.770 --> 04:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
so it appears we have
 
04:42:12.410 --> 04:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:16.208 --> 04:42:16.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
04:42:20.330 --> 04:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative my question uh just for
 
04:42:23.040 --> 04:42:24.830 align:start position:0%
representative my question uh just for
clarification

04:42:24.830 --> 04:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
04:42:27.050 --> 04:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I apologize for not having that
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
particular particular bill in
 
04:42:32.330 --> 04:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
this commission uh part of this member
 
04:42:34.990 --> 04:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
should be include any of the utilities
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
and if not I believe we heard testimony
 
04:42:42.770 --> 04:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
some years ago that the war one of the
 
04:42:42.780 --> 04:42:44.350 align:start position:0%
some years ago that the war one of the
utilities

04:42:44.350 --> 04:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
04:42:48.830 --> 04:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
are or know about microgrids and are
 
04:42:51.850 --> 04:42:51.860 align:start position:0%
working on some on their own can you
 
04:42:54.830 --> 04:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
extract that and how that would play
 
04:42:56.990 --> 04:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
into being on his commissions
 
04:42:57.000 --> 04:42:58.010 align:start position:0%
into being on his commissions
okay

04:42:58.010 --> 04:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Thomas for
 
04:43:02.208 --> 04:43:02.218 align:start position:0%
the question uh I just want to clarify
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a commission it's a committee
 
04:43:07.550 --> 04:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
study committee and
 
04:43:11.170 --> 04:43:11.180 align:start position:0%
as I wrote it initially it does not
 
04:43:13.570 --> 04:43:13.580 align:start position:0%
specifically mention
 
04:43:17.750 --> 04:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
the utilities but I am
 
04:43:20.270 --> 04:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
first of all I totally would would think
 
04:43:21.890 --> 04:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
that the utilities have to be part of
 
04:43:24.708 --> 04:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
this project and I would be open to
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
amending the membership to include them
 
04:43:30.890 --> 04:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:30.900 --> 04:43:34.850 align:start position:0%
 
Thomas

04:43:34.850 --> 04:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:38.090 --> 04:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up are you aware if they
 
04:43:40.250 --> 04:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
are or aren't acting on any of my groups
 
04:43:42.050 --> 04:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
at the present time at all for your
 
04:43:42.060 --> 04:43:43.430 align:start position:0%
at the present time at all for your
lawyer

04:43:43.430 --> 04:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
04:43:48.288 --> 04:43:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:49.970 --> 04:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Thomas I didn't
 
04:43:51.170 --> 04:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
quite hear you
 
04:43:54.650 --> 04:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I said are you aware if if the
 
04:43:56.570 --> 04:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
utilities are
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable and are perhaps working on
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
some long-range plants or microgreens on
 
04:44:04.850 --> 04:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:07.250 --> 04:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
um I I thank you representative for the
 
04:44:10.070 --> 04:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
question I I must say I I don't know for
 
04:44:12.170 --> 04:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
sure I've had conversations with several
 
04:44:14.930 --> 04:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
of them and uh all of them seem to be
 
04:44:17.448 --> 04:44:17.458 align:start position:0%
interested in the idea and I haven't
 
04:44:20.390 --> 04:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
heard any pushback against it uh but I
 
04:44:21.890 --> 04:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
haven't heard also that they had any
 
04:44:24.770 --> 04:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
particular plans
 
04:44:27.530 --> 04:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
especially yeah
 
04:44:30.050 --> 04:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samsuch as we
 
04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned before UNH is involved with
 
04:44:36.530 --> 04:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
eversource in researching microgrids at
 
04:44:37.610 --> 04:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
the University
 
04:44:41.628 --> 04:44:41.638 align:start position:0%
and so are there any more questions from
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
any of the members here in the room
 
04:44:48.110 --> 04:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
I see no more questions from those
 
04:44:51.948 --> 04:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
online so I would like to
 
04:44:55.850 --> 04:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
read the blue sheet and I have received
 
04:44:57.288 --> 04:44:57.298 align:start position:0%
a request
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
that I not only list the numbers on the
 
04:45:02.448 --> 04:45:02.458 align:start position:0%
blue sheet but read the names on the
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
blue sheet so I will attempt to do that
 
04:45:09.708 --> 04:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
so for this bill there were seven who

everyone
 
05:01:32.990 --> 05:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
I would like to now open the

05:01:40.910 --> 05:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
and since I am the prime sponsor of that
 
05:01:43.788 --> 05:01:43.798 align:start position:0%
bill I will introduce it to the
 
05:01:43.798 --> 05:01:46.690 align:start position:0%
bill I will introduce it to the
committee

05:01:46.690 --> 05:01:46.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:49.190 --> 05:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
05:01:52.368 --> 05:01:52.378 align:start position:0%
Senator Ruth Ward and I co-sponsored a
 
05:01:54.770 --> 05:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
bill that was introduced to the Senate
 
05:01:56.990 --> 05:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
that was essentially the substance of
 
05:02:00.430 --> 05:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
the bill you see before you here today
 
05:02:03.830 --> 05:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh energy and resources
 
05:02:06.830 --> 05:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
committee passed that bill uh with a an
 
05:02:06.840 --> 05:02:08.090 align:start position:0%
committee passed that bill uh with a an
amendment

05:02:08.090 --> 05:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:02:10.910 --> 05:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
and then the full Senate basket on a
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
Voice vote
 
05:02:15.050 --> 05:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
and they were about to send it to the
 
05:02:16.368 --> 05:02:16.378 align:start position:0%
house when
 
05:02:20.510 --> 05:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
covid-19 interrupted the natural flow of
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislative activity
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
that bill which was called SB 626 was
 
05:02:29.868 --> 05:02:29.878 align:start position:0%
briefly added to one of the Omnibus
 
05:02:31.390 --> 05:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
Senate bills
 
05:02:34.970 --> 05:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
but at some point it got extracted from
 
05:02:39.530 --> 05:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
that bill and was eventually tabled
 
05:02:42.050 --> 05:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
so I have reintroduced the bill this
 
05:02:45.890 --> 05:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
year as House Bill 624
 
05:02:48.830 --> 05:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
essentially what this bill does is it
 
05:02:52.128 --> 05:02:52.138 align:start position:0%
lowers the fee for a declaratory ruling
 
05:02:54.230 --> 05:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
from the site evaluation committee from
 
05:02:56.810 --> 05:02:56.820 align:start position:0%
either ten thousand five hundred dollars
 
05:02:58.788 --> 05:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
or three thousand dollars depending on
 
05:03:00.530 --> 05:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
whether it's heard by the full committee
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
or a subcommittee to 250 dollars
 
05:03:07.310 --> 05:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
that was the
 
05:03:10.250 --> 05:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
dollar figure established by the Senate
 
05:03:13.430 --> 05:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
and their amendment to Senate Bill 626
 
05:03:15.350 --> 05:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:03:18.110 --> 05:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
I decided to keep that dollar amount the
 
05:03:19.910 --> 05:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
original Bill actually lowered it to a
 
05:03:22.368 --> 05:03:22.378 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars but since the Senate
 
05:03:24.770 --> 05:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
thought it was 250 was a good number we
 
05:03:28.610 --> 05:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:31.788 --> 05:03:31.798 align:start position:0%
now the reason for lowering the price of
 
05:03:34.550 --> 05:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
a declaratory ruling
 
05:03:37.310 --> 05:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
was to make the site evaluation
 
05:03:37.320 --> 05:03:38.510 align:start position:0%
was to make the site evaluation
committee

05:03:38.510 --> 05:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:03:40.430 --> 05:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
process more accessible to the General
 
05:03:40.440 --> 05:03:41.810 align:start position:0%
process more accessible to the General
Public

05:03:41.810 --> 05:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
Public
 
05:03:44.330 --> 05:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
at a price of either ten thousand or
 
05:03:46.368 --> 05:03:46.378 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars getting a
 
05:03:47.990 --> 05:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling from the commission
 
05:03:50.930 --> 05:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
was prohibitively expensive for the
 
05:03:53.750 --> 05:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
average person
 
05:03:56.390 --> 05:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
and it was the police of Senator Ward
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
and myself and several other folks who
 
05:04:01.430 --> 05:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
you will hear from later today
 
05:04:03.770 --> 05:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
that in order to make the site
 
05:04:06.250 --> 05:04:06.260 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee process
 
05:04:10.490 --> 05:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
transparent and to
 
05:04:12.948 --> 05:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
ensure that the public can trust the
 
05:04:12.958 --> 05:04:14.390 align:start position:0%
ensure that the public can trust the
process

05:04:14.390 --> 05:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:04:16.490 --> 05:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
the public needs access to the process
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
and so lowering the price for a
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling
 
05:04:20.878 --> 05:04:21.830 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling
uh

05:04:21.830 --> 05:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:04:25.310 --> 05:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
was a way to make that happen
 
05:04:27.350 --> 05:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
now what is a declaratory ruling
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
basically a declaratory ruling request
 
05:04:32.410 --> 05:04:32.420 align:start position:0%
from the site evaluation committee
 
05:04:36.948 --> 05:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
a judgment about some serious question
 
05:04:40.670 --> 05:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
about an energy citing certificate
 
05:04:43.250 --> 05:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
these certificate comes with terms and
 
05:04:46.010 --> 05:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
conditions and typically a
 
05:04:49.128 --> 05:04:49.138 align:start position:0%
question might arise about whether the
 
05:04:51.230 --> 05:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions are being
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
followed and met by the owner of the
 
05:04:55.440 --> 05:04:57.050 align:start position:0%
followed and met by the owner of the
certificate

05:04:57.050 --> 05:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
05:04:58.970 --> 05:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:05:01.368 --> 05:05:01.378 align:start position:0%
as you will hear in later testimony this
 
05:05:03.250 --> 05:05:03.260 align:start position:0%
morning or this afternoon
 
05:05:05.390 --> 05:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:05:08.690 --> 05:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
occasions when the certificate of a
 
05:05:11.208 --> 05:05:11.218 align:start position:0%
particular energy
 
05:05:11.218 --> 05:05:13.010 align:start position:0%
particular energy
project

05:05:13.010 --> 05:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:05:15.470 --> 05:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
is questioned as to whether or not its
 
05:05:19.190 --> 05:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:21.170 --> 05:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
I took advantage of the
 
05:05:21.180 --> 05:05:23.390 align:start position:0%
I took advantage of the
opportunity

05:05:23.390 --> 05:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
05:05:26.570 --> 05:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
of introducing this bill to also make a
 
05:05:28.670 --> 05:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
couple of clarifications to the language
 
05:05:31.970 --> 05:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
of the bill to indicate that it is the
 
05:05:33.830 --> 05:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the sign evaluation
 
05:05:37.310 --> 05:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
committee to judge whether or not
 
05:05:39.850 --> 05:05:39.860 align:start position:0%
and the energy sighting certificates
 
05:05:43.010 --> 05:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions are being met and
 
05:05:43.020 --> 05:05:44.868 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions are being met and
followed

05:05:44.868 --> 05:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
followed
 
05:05:47.090 --> 05:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
the language of the
 
05:05:50.030 --> 05:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
statute prior
 
05:05:52.190 --> 05:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
led to some confusion about whether or
 
05:05:54.350 --> 05:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
not the administrator of the site
 
05:05:56.448 --> 05:05:56.458 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee could make
 
05:05:58.490 --> 05:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
judgments about whether a terms and
 
05:06:01.430 --> 05:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
conditions were being followed
 
05:06:03.890 --> 05:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
it is our belief that the administrator
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
of the SEC can gather information about
 
05:06:13.030 --> 05:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
terms and con conditions can register
 
05:06:16.730 --> 05:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
or gather the complaints about
 
05:06:20.270 --> 05:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
any such terms or conditions but can't
 
05:06:22.368 --> 05:06:22.378 align:start position:0%
pass judgment on whether or not those
 
05:06:24.050 --> 05:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions are being followed
 
05:06:26.570 --> 05:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
that's something that only the full site
 
05:06:29.208 --> 05:06:29.218 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee should do
 
05:06:31.310 --> 05:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
so the bill makes a couple of small
 
05:06:34.670 --> 05:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:36.550 --> 05:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
or in the statute
 
05:06:38.810 --> 05:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
to clarify
 
05:06:38.820 --> 05:06:41.750 align:start position:0%
to clarify
that

05:06:41.750 --> 05:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:44.570 --> 05:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
it is the full site evaluation committee
 
05:06:47.810 --> 05:06:47.820 align:start position:0%
that ensures the terms and conditions of
 
05:06:50.810 --> 05:06:50.820 align:start position:0%
sort of a certificate are being met so
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bill on line four and
 
05:06:57.350 --> 05:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
we added the words the committee
 
05:06:59.750 --> 05:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
to clarify in that sentence that it is
 
05:07:02.030 --> 05:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
the committee that does this work and
 
05:07:05.448 --> 05:07:05.458 align:start position:0%
then on line 22 you'll
 
05:07:07.850 --> 05:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
see that we deleted the words or the
 
05:07:11.030 --> 05:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
administrator as designee
 
05:07:14.510 --> 05:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
from the sentence that uh talks about
 
05:07:17.208 --> 05:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
who can determine whether any term or
 
05:07:19.368 --> 05:07:19.378 align:start position:0%
condition of a certificate is being
 
05:07:19.378 --> 05:07:20.990 align:start position:0%
condition of a certificate is being
violated

05:07:20.990 --> 05:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
violated
 
05:07:23.810 --> 05:07:23.820 align:start position:0%
so those changes to the statute language
 
05:07:26.990 --> 05:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
will clarify that it is in fact the site
 
05:07:29.330 --> 05:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
05:07:32.330 --> 05:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
has the responsibility for determining
 
05:07:34.550 --> 05:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
if the terms and conditions of a site
 
05:07:38.208 --> 05:07:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:40.730 --> 05:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
now there is a larger issue which I'm
 
05:07:42.350 --> 05:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
sure you will hear about in a moment
 
05:07:42.360 --> 05:07:45.170 align:start position:0%
sure you will hear about in a moment
because

05:07:45.170 --> 05:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:46.788 --> 05:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
the chair of the site evaluation
 
05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
committee who also happens to be the
 
05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
chair of the Public Utilities Commission
 
05:07:54.830 --> 05:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
Diane Martin will testify in in just a
 
05:07:57.050 --> 05:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
few minutes on this bill
 
05:07:57.060 --> 05:07:59.990 align:start position:0%
few minutes on this bill
and

05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:03.470 --> 05:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
in her testimony you'll likely hear that
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committees
 
05:08:09.288 --> 05:08:09.298 align:start position:0%
funding situation is
 
05:08:13.550 --> 05:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
apparently not that sound
 
05:08:15.530 --> 05:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
the way the site evaluation committee
 
05:08:18.110 --> 05:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
gets its funding right now is when I
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
application is made for a site
 
05:08:20.760 --> 05:08:22.190 align:start position:0%
application is made for a site
certificate

05:08:22.190 --> 05:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
05:08:24.050 --> 05:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
the committee can impose substantial
 
05:08:28.190 --> 05:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
fees on the applicant to do the work
 
05:08:30.890 --> 05:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
that's necessary to determine if the
 
05:08:33.470 --> 05:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
certificate is a valid one
 
05:08:35.510 --> 05:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
but once the certificate is awarded
 
05:08:37.670 --> 05:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
there doesn't appear to be a lot of
 
05:08:42.110 --> 05:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
additional funding available to enforce
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
the terms and conditions of the
 
05:08:44.400 --> 05:08:45.650 align:start position:0%
the terms and conditions of the
certificate

05:08:45.650 --> 05:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
05:08:45.660 --> 05:08:47.030 align:start position:0%
certificate
and

05:08:47.030 --> 05:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:49.128 --> 05:08:49.138 align:start position:0%
the high price of declaratory rulings
 
05:08:50.868 --> 05:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
was one of the ways that the committee
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
made up of that lack of funding
 
05:08:57.288 --> 05:08:57.298 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that further
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
reform is needed of the
 
05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee process to
 
05:09:05.690 --> 05:09:05.700 align:start position:0%
provide for funding
 
05:09:08.690 --> 05:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
to deal with issues that arise after a
 
05:09:10.670 --> 05:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
certificate is issued
 
05:09:13.930 --> 05:09:13.940 align:start position:0%
and I trust that Ms Martin will
 
05:09:16.670 --> 05:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
elucidate on that issue
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
it was outside the scope and the purview
 
05:09:20.990 --> 05:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
05:09:23.868 --> 05:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
possibly if we pass it here and it moves
 
05:09:25.190 --> 05:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
on to the Senate that is you could
 
05:09:29.448 --> 05:09:29.458 align:start position:0%
address there but for now
 
05:09:32.208 --> 05:09:32.218 align:start position:0%
all we address in this issue in this uh
 
05:09:34.970 --> 05:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
in this bill in this legislation is the
 
05:09:37.310 --> 05:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
issue of making the site evaluation
 
05:09:40.750 --> 05:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
process more trustworthy by allowing
 
05:09:46.010 --> 05:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
access of the public to the process
 
05:09:49.190 --> 05:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
so that's my uh explanation of what this
 
05:09:51.410 --> 05:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
bill is all about and I'll be happy to
 
05:09:53.628 --> 05:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
take questions from
 
05:09:55.690 --> 05:09:55.700 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi is recognized
 
05:09:59.570 --> 05:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
05:10:02.448 --> 05:10:02.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:10:04.868 --> 05:10:04.878 align:start position:0%
the past how many
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:11.750 --> 05:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
how big this
 
05:10:14.448 --> 05:10:14.458 align:start position:0%
happen is
 
05:10:19.010 --> 05:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
in testimony before the Senate last year
 
05:10:21.170 --> 05:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
the then administrator site
 
05:10:21.180 --> 05:10:22.570 align:start position:0%
the then administrator site
administrator

05:10:22.570 --> 05:10:22.580 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
05:10:24.530 --> 05:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
administrator of the site evaluation
 
05:10:24.540 --> 05:10:25.550 align:start position:0%
administrator of the site evaluation
committee

05:10:25.550 --> 05:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:10:29.030 --> 05:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
Pamela Martin or Pamela
 
05:10:31.310 --> 05:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
I've got her name now but the then
 
05:10:33.170 --> 05:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
administrator testified that there had
 
05:10:34.368 --> 05:10:34.378 align:start position:0%
been three
 
05:10:36.650 --> 05:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
request for declaratory ruling since
 
05:10:36.660 --> 05:10:38.930 align:start position:0%
request for declaratory ruling since
2015.

05:10:38.930 --> 05:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
2015.
 
05:10:41.770 --> 05:10:41.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:44.270 --> 05:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative Presley thank you Mr
 
05:10:46.190 --> 05:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
chairman what was the original reason
 
05:10:50.510 --> 05:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:52.128 --> 05:10:52.138 align:start position:0%
I've heard a couple of reasons for that
 
05:10:54.050 --> 05:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I heard was to
 
05:10:56.990 --> 05:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
discourage nuisance requests for a
 
05:10:58.850 --> 05:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling
 
05:10:58.860 --> 05:11:00.368 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling
but

05:11:00.368 --> 05:11:00.378 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
there have been no nuisance requests
 
05:11:07.250 --> 05:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
made as of this date
 
05:11:10.010 --> 05:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
another reason I heard is because they
 
05:11:12.590 --> 05:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
need the excited evaluation committee
 
05:11:13.868 --> 05:11:13.878 align:start position:0%
needs the money
 
05:11:15.890 --> 05:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
to fund
 
05:11:19.310 --> 05:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
to fund dealing with
 
05:11:21.890 --> 05:11:21.900 align:start position:0%
the aftermath of a
 
05:11:24.050 --> 05:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
warded certificate
 
05:11:26.270 --> 05:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
but maybe Miss Martin can shed some
 
05:11:29.030 --> 05:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:32.330 --> 05:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:38.390 --> 05:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know maybe we'll hear
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
it from his apartment you have to know
 
05:11:46.250 --> 05:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
how much effort is involved and
 
05:11:50.510 --> 05:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
going through the dictionary really
 
05:11:50.520 --> 05:11:51.670 align:start position:0%
going through the dictionary really
talking

05:11:51.670 --> 05:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
talking
 
05:11:54.230 --> 05:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
months and months of Manpower or
 
05:11:59.448 --> 05:11:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:01.730 --> 05:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
well I think it requires the committee
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
to be convened and to hold at least one
 
05:12:08.390 --> 05:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
meeting maybe multiple meetings to come
 
05:12:10.788 --> 05:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
to some kind of a resolution sometimes
 
05:12:13.190 --> 05:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
the committee can also be required to
 
05:12:13.200 --> 05:12:14.390 align:start position:0%
the committee can also be required to
hire

05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
hire
 
05:12:19.670 --> 05:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:22.250 --> 05:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
the question being asked or the
 
05:12:25.850 --> 05:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
complaint being filed so it could be
 
05:12:27.948 --> 05:12:27.958 align:start position:0%
a simple situation or it could be a
 
05:12:30.050 --> 05:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
complex one
 
05:12:33.110 --> 05:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
either way uh
 
05:12:36.410 --> 05:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
nobody will be able to to access or a
 
05:12:38.090 --> 05:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
few people will be able to access the
 
05:12:41.930 --> 05:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
committee if the fee stays at ten
 
05:12:46.670 --> 05:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:49.070 --> 05:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions from folks in the
 
05:12:50.930 --> 05:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
room here
 
05:12:54.170 --> 05:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
see none I will attempt to figure out
 
05:12:56.448 --> 05:12:56.458 align:start position:0%
who raise their hand first here it looks
 
05:12:56.458 --> 05:12:57.410 align:start position:0%
who raise their hand first here it looks
like

05:12:57.410 --> 05:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative samsich is recognized for
 
05:13:02.030 --> 05:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
a question
 
05:13:04.610 --> 05:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
05:13:08.650 --> 05:13:08.660 align:start position:0%
um so we just heard that um
 
05:13:12.230 --> 05:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
that the number of requests is 2015 was
 
05:13:12.240 --> 05:13:13.430 align:start position:0%
that the number of requests is 2015 was
three

05:13:13.430 --> 05:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:13:16.250 --> 05:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
so that means you only get one of those
 
05:13:18.350 --> 05:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
things every two years
 
05:13:20.330 --> 05:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
I can't see how that would be much
 
05:13:24.110 --> 05:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
funding if funding is an issue then I
 
05:13:26.030 --> 05:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
could see that you know we're lowering
 
05:13:28.550 --> 05:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
it to a price where people might be
 
05:13:30.830 --> 05:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
willing to take advantage of it more
 
05:13:32.330 --> 05:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
frequently that would certainly give you
 
05:13:34.430 --> 05:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
more funding so I
 
05:13:37.490 --> 05:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
I I I'm a little perplexed about whether
 
05:13:40.430 --> 05:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
it is the funding issue or or whether
 
05:13:42.530 --> 05:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
it's the nuisance issue
 
05:13:42.540 --> 05:13:43.190 align:start position:0%
it's the nuisance issue
um

05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:46.670 --> 05:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea what what the main
 
05:13:49.490 --> 05:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
what the primary motivator was for the
 
05:13:53.448 --> 05:13:53.458 align:start position:0%
higher fee I mean I I don't know
 
05:13:55.310 --> 05:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
the first response I got when I asked
 
05:13:58.788 --> 05:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
that question was to discourage nuisance
 
05:13:58.798 --> 05:13:59.690 align:start position:0%
that question was to discourage nuisance
yeah

05:13:59.690 --> 05:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:13:59.700 --> 05:14:01.070 align:start position:0%
yeah
issues

05:14:01.070 --> 05:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:14:04.128 --> 05:14:04.138 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure miss Martin will help us
 
05:14:05.990 --> 05:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
with that when she testifies in just a
 
05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
few minutes
 
05:14:10.850 --> 05:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
past representative Kelly Pitts is
 
05:14:15.470 --> 05:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:20.270 --> 05:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:21.890 --> 05:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
I just don't want you to hear me
 
05:14:21.900 --> 05:14:23.150 align:start position:0%
I just don't want you to hear me
breathing

05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
breathing
 
05:14:25.910 --> 05:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
um the site evaluation committee
 
05:14:29.750 --> 05:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
permit is Akin in my mind simplistic
 
05:14:31.788 --> 05:14:31.798 align:start position:0%
little building permit
 
05:14:34.250 --> 05:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
and the people who
 
05:14:36.530 --> 05:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
follow these things
 
05:14:39.288 --> 05:14:39.298 align:start position:0%
if they notice that
 
05:14:42.650 --> 05:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
they don't believe that that the
 
05:14:45.830 --> 05:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
conditions of this building permit are
 
05:14:48.530 --> 05:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
being adhered to you can't is there
 
05:14:51.650 --> 05:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
anybody you can go to and complain about
 
05:14:54.230 --> 05:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
this without filing a ten thousand
 
05:14:58.730 --> 05:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:01.128 --> 05:15:01.138 align:start position:0%
if I understand your question correctly
 
05:15:02.750 --> 05:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative and thank you for that
 
05:15:02.760 --> 05:15:05.628 align:start position:0%
representative and thank you for that
question

05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:09.110 --> 05:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
you're asking is there a cheaper way to
 
05:15:12.170 --> 05:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
get a resolution of a of a question or a
 
05:15:12.180 --> 05:15:13.250 align:start position:0%
get a resolution of a of a question or a
complaint

05:15:13.250 --> 05:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
05:15:15.708 --> 05:15:15.718 align:start position:0%
and right they're an appeal process
 
05:15:20.570 --> 05:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:24.230 --> 05:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
part of what a site certificate terms
 
05:15:28.850 --> 05:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
and conditions provide is guidance about
 
05:15:31.850 --> 05:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
the day-to-day operation of the energy
 
05:15:34.190 --> 05:15:34.200 align:start position:0%
facility and as we'll hear in testimony
 
05:15:38.628 --> 05:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:41.208 --> 05:15:41.218 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
05:15:44.448 --> 05:15:44.458 align:start position:0%
energy facilities that has been causing
 
05:15:46.670 --> 05:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
some issues with some folks is the
 
05:15:55.690 --> 05:15:55.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:00.470 --> 05:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:02.030 --> 05:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
keeping my finger on the button is
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:09.050 --> 05:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
as I was I forgot exactly when I turned
 
05:16:10.610 --> 05:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
the button off but as I was trying to
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
say we'll hear and testimony later this
 
05:16:15.708 --> 05:16:15.718 align:start position:0%
this afternoon about some problems with
 
05:16:19.250 --> 05:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
the antrum Wind Facility and that will
 
05:16:21.948 --> 05:16:21.958 align:start position:0%
maybe be illustrative of
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
what can happen when a a site
 
05:16:27.230 --> 05:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
certificate terms and conditions are not
 
05:16:27.240 --> 05:16:28.430 align:start position:0%
certificate terms and conditions are not
being

05:16:28.430 --> 05:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:16:31.250 --> 05:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
or are suspected of not being followed
 
05:16:34.250 --> 05:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
so I hope that answers your question
 
05:16:34.260 --> 05:16:37.250 align:start position:0%
so I hope that answers your question
almost

05:16:37.250 --> 05:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:40.128 --> 05:16:40.138 align:start position:0%
do you want to elaborate well I I just I
 
05:16:43.430 --> 05:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know I can't believe that or I'm
 
05:16:46.190 --> 05:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
having a hard time believing that there
 
05:16:49.690 --> 05:16:49.700 align:start position:0%
is no process by which
 
05:16:53.150 --> 05:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
these people and I I've been up to the
 
05:16:55.850 --> 05:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
antrum when why they can't
 
05:16:58.128 --> 05:16:58.138 align:start position:0%
there's nobody that they can go to to
 
05:17:01.070 --> 05:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
appeal this either the puc or the the
 
05:17:05.208 --> 05:17:05.218 align:start position:0%
there must be some oversight at the uh
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
at at the site evaluation committee they
 
05:17:10.250 --> 05:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
issue these permits and then they go
 
05:17:13.010 --> 05:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
away and never come back again I mean I
 
05:17:15.170 --> 05:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
I didn't think that that was the case
 
05:17:16.910 --> 05:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
through all the site evaluation
 
05:17:19.128 --> 05:17:19.138 align:start position:0%
committee hearings we've had
 
05:17:20.810 --> 05:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
I thought there was somebody that's
 
05:17:22.310 --> 05:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to keep track of what's going
 
05:17:22.320 --> 05:17:24.708 align:start position:0%
supposed to keep track of what's going
on

05:17:24.708 --> 05:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:26.990 --> 05:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
no typically it's not that simple
 
05:17:29.390 --> 05:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
um the part of the terms and conditions
 
05:17:32.868 --> 05:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
of a certificate include for example in
 
05:17:34.610 --> 05:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
the case of Antrim win
 
05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
regular quarterly or semi-yearly tests
 
05:17:43.910 --> 05:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
sound tests of the facility and
 
05:17:46.970 --> 05:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
the question arises about whether those
 
05:17:48.890 --> 05:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
sound tests are accurate whether they're
 
05:17:52.850 --> 05:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
being implemented correctly then uh the
 
05:17:56.030 --> 05:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
public might want to ask questions of
 
05:17:57.708 --> 05:17:57.718 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee and have
 
05:18:00.050 --> 05:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
them investigate just exactly what's
 
05:18:01.970 --> 05:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
going on we'll hear more about that
 
05:18:01.980 --> 05:18:03.230 align:start position:0%
going on we'll hear more about that
later

05:18:03.230 --> 05:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
later
 
05:18:06.410 --> 05:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
if I'm sorry Mr chairman and that costs
 
05:18:08.390 --> 05:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars
 
05:18:10.490 --> 05:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
for them to ask questions
 
05:18:13.730 --> 05:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
right now it does yes
 
05:18:15.590 --> 05:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:17.628 --> 05:18:17.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:18:21.230 --> 05:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
next up is representative Jacqueline
 
05:18:21.240 --> 05:18:24.770 align:start position:0%
next up is representative Jacqueline
credition

05:18:24.770 --> 05:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:27.050 --> 05:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Bose
 
05:18:28.550 --> 05:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
um actually one of my questions was
 
05:18:30.350 --> 05:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
already just answered um so I was
 
05:18:31.970 --> 05:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
wondering would it be possible maybe to
 
05:18:34.368 --> 05:18:34.378 align:start position:0%
give an example of one of those requests
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
that has come in over the last three
 
05:18:38.570 --> 05:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
years just to give me a sense of
 
05:18:40.788 --> 05:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
the questions that are at that ten
 
05:18:43.310 --> 05:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar level right now um
 
05:18:45.650 --> 05:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
answered resolved
 
05:18:47.330 --> 05:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I don't
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
remember the
 
05:18:53.530 --> 05:18:53.540 align:start position:0%
what the three previous
 
05:18:55.970 --> 05:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling requests were all
 
05:18:55.980 --> 05:18:57.350 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling requests were all
about

05:18:57.350 --> 05:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:18:57.360 --> 05:18:58.490 align:start position:0%
about
um

05:18:58.490 --> 05:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:01.070 --> 05:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
the most recent declaratory ruling
 
05:19:04.250 --> 05:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
request is about Antrim win and you'll
 
05:19:06.050 --> 05:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about that in just a few
 
05:19:06.060 --> 05:19:07.970 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about that in just a few
minutes

05:19:07.970 --> 05:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
05:19:09.288 --> 05:19:09.298 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
is that awesome
 
05:19:21.170 --> 05:19:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh on the
 
05:19:28.128 --> 05:19:28.138 align:start position:0%
financial notes it indicates that this
 
05:19:31.010 --> 05:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
bill will leave uh essentially a money
 
05:19:31.020 --> 05:19:32.110 align:start position:0%
bill will leave uh essentially a money
hole

05:19:32.110 --> 05:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
hole
 
05:19:35.090 --> 05:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
which has to be made up
 
05:19:39.890 --> 05:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
by legislation or some other means uh I
 
05:19:41.448 --> 05:19:41.458 align:start position:0%
mean typically
 
05:19:41.458 --> 05:19:42.830 align:start position:0%
mean typically
uh

05:19:42.830 --> 05:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:19:46.310 --> 05:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
these committees they have to find the
 
05:19:46.320 --> 05:19:47.350 align:start position:0%
these committees they have to find the
money

05:19:47.350 --> 05:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:19:50.868 --> 05:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
using the fees
 
05:19:55.730 --> 05:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
or or maybe by increasing rates yes I'm
 
05:19:58.430 --> 05:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if if we're taking the fees
 
05:19:58.440 --> 05:20:00.490 align:start position:0%
wondering if if we're taking the fees
away

05:20:00.490 --> 05:20:00.500 align:start position:0%
away
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
and knowing that this won't come out of
 
05:20:04.270 --> 05:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
05:20:07.670 --> 05:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
where else would they get the money to
 
05:20:10.970 --> 05:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:12.350 --> 05:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question as I
 
05:20:14.448 --> 05:20:14.458 align:start position:0%
indicated in my testimony
 
05:20:17.570 --> 05:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
some reform of the funding of the site
 
05:20:19.250 --> 05:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee would definitely
 
05:20:22.250 --> 05:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
seem to be in order that was beyond the
 
05:20:23.868 --> 05:20:23.878 align:start position:0%
scope of
 
05:20:26.448 --> 05:20:26.458 align:start position:0%
my legislation
 
05:20:26.458 --> 05:20:28.128 align:start position:0%
my legislation
um

05:20:28.128 --> 05:20:28.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:30.890 --> 05:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
the question we're debating or or the
 
05:20:33.070 --> 05:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
question that this bill tries to address
 
05:20:36.350 --> 05:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
is what's more important the funding
 
05:20:38.510 --> 05:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
issue which I'm sure we can find a
 
05:20:40.610 --> 05:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
solution for eventually
 
05:20:43.550 --> 05:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
or trust in the size evaluation
 
05:20:46.730 --> 05:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
committee process by giving the public
 
05:20:50.030 --> 05:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
access to that process so that's the
 
05:20:54.410 --> 05:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
essence of what we have to decide as we
 
05:20:57.170 --> 05:20:57.180 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not to go forward with
 
05:20:59.090 --> 05:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:21:01.910 --> 05:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
next step is uh representative Michael
 
05:21:03.708 --> 05:21:03.718 align:start position:0%
Harrington recognized for a question
 
05:21:05.930 --> 05:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman let me stop
 
05:21:07.310 --> 05:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
by saying that I'm familiar with the
 
05:21:09.050 --> 05:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee because I
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
believe I'm probably the only member of
 
05:21:12.350 --> 05:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
the committee that's actually served on
 
05:21:14.690 --> 05:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
it I served on I don't know eight ten of
 
05:21:17.208 --> 05:21:17.218 align:start position:0%
them whatever quite a few so to get back
 
05:21:20.570 --> 05:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
to uh Kelly Pitts question
 
05:21:23.868 --> 05:21:23.878 align:start position:0%
there is options meaning that if you if
 
05:21:25.970 --> 05:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
someone who is an aggrieved individual
 
05:21:28.430 --> 05:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
citizen called up the administrator or
 
05:21:30.470 --> 05:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
called up the general counsel was uh I
 
05:21:33.170 --> 05:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
believe is still Mike icolpino or a
 
05:21:34.788 --> 05:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
member of the site evaluation committee
 
05:21:36.530 --> 05:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
expressed concern that something wasn't
 
05:21:38.868 --> 05:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
being followed by their uh conditions
 
05:21:40.610 --> 05:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
that I would hope those people would
 
05:21:43.128 --> 05:21:43.138 align:start position:0%
follow up on that but there's no
 
05:21:46.310 --> 05:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
official process for doing that without
 
05:21:48.590 --> 05:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
actually follow filing the formal
 
05:21:50.030 --> 05:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
requests which is the ten thousand
 
05:21:52.190 --> 05:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
dollar one so I think that's the big
 
05:21:53.690 --> 05:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
reason we're looking at this so if
 
05:21:55.970 --> 05:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
someone's discouraged if they discuss it
 
05:21:58.430 --> 05:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
with the administrator or the council or
 
05:22:00.110 --> 05:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
remember the site evaluation committee
 
05:22:01.970 --> 05:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
and those people say well we believe
 
05:22:04.010 --> 05:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's being done and the person the
 
05:22:07.128 --> 05:22:07.138 align:start position:0%
individual doesn't believe it they then
 
05:22:09.288 --> 05:22:09.298 align:start position:0%
have the option of just going home and
 
05:22:11.330 --> 05:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
going away or spending ten thousand
 
05:22:13.610 --> 05:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
dollars and I think this is what this uh
 
05:22:16.128 --> 05:22:16.138 align:start position:0%
this bill is is going up to uh do and
 
05:22:18.470 --> 05:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
like I I agree with the chairman on the
 
05:22:19.970 --> 05:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
funding issue that's something that's
 
05:22:21.890 --> 05:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
going to have to look that but we really
 
05:22:24.708 --> 05:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that uh people believe
 
05:22:26.570 --> 05:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
in the process because this is sort of a
 
05:22:28.670 --> 05:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
David and Goliath most of these projects
 
05:22:31.190 --> 05:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
are in the tens or hundreds of millions
 
05:22:33.110 --> 05:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
of dollars and if you are individual
 
05:22:34.850 --> 05:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
landowner who happens to have bought one
 
05:22:37.850 --> 05:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
of these projects you had a huge
 
05:22:40.190 --> 05:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
disadvantage if you have to spend ten
 
05:22:41.628 --> 05:22:41.638 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to get a declaratory
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
judgment so I hope that clarifies a few
 
05:22:45.830 --> 05:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
things for people
 
05:22:49.610 --> 05:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Harrington
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
so I see no more questions uh no more
 
05:22:55.850 --> 05:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
hands raised except for Representative
 
05:22:57.530 --> 05:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
Sam said she's already had his two
 
05:22:59.390 --> 05:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
questions I believe so
 
05:23:05.150 --> 05:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
all right you get one more go ahead
 
05:23:11.208 --> 05:23:11.218 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman uh so
 
05:23:14.990 --> 05:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
um uh and I'm glad that representative
 
05:23:16.670 --> 05:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington is on this call as well
 
05:23:16.680 --> 05:23:18.050 align:start position:0%
Harrington is on this call as well
because

05:23:18.050 --> 05:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:23:21.230 --> 05:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
um are is there not already maybe I'm
 
05:23:23.810 --> 05:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
confusing the two I think when they that
 
05:23:25.750 --> 05:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee looks at a project
 
05:23:28.730 --> 05:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
there is public input in that project
 
05:23:31.128 --> 05:23:31.138 align:start position:0%
process I believe in people who have
 
05:23:34.250 --> 05:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
objections can bring them up and I've I
 
05:23:36.170 --> 05:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
heard in the past that there is also
 
05:23:38.930 --> 05:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
some kind of attorney for the public
 
05:23:42.050 --> 05:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
part of this process that can uh
 
05:23:45.288 --> 05:23:45.298 align:start position:0%
basically Champion a residence or or
 
05:23:47.750 --> 05:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
affected individuals in bringing up
 
05:23:52.788 --> 05:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:55.368 --> 05:23:55.378 align:start position:0%
yes the situation is the site evaluation
 
05:23:58.250 --> 05:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
committee process is a public process
 
05:23:58.260 --> 05:23:59.090 align:start position:0%
committee process is a public process
um

05:23:59.090 --> 05:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:01.610 --> 05:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
that's not a question that this bill
 
05:24:03.948 --> 05:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
tries to address essentially this drill
 
05:24:06.230 --> 05:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
Bill tries to adjust address what
 
05:24:08.930 --> 05:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
happens when a when the terms and
 
05:24:11.090 --> 05:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
conditions of a certificate that's been
 
05:24:13.550 --> 05:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
issued are no longer being met how does
 
05:24:16.490 --> 05:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
the public gain access to address that
 
05:24:16.500 --> 05:24:17.510 align:start position:0%
the public gain access to address that
question

05:24:17.510 --> 05:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:24:20.448 --> 05:24:20.458 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question thank you
 
05:24:24.770 --> 05:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
and uh now I would like to call on the
 
05:24:27.110 --> 05:24:27.120 align:start position:0%

I'm not sure
 
05:24:43.368 --> 05:24:43.378 align:start position:0%
Ms Martin did you submit written
 
05:24:56.510 --> 05:24:56.520 align:start position:0%

out quickly so that everyone has an

ones we're talking about today that are

into that SEC fund

the law limits though how that money

within the SEC fund may be used
 
05:26:12.708 --> 05:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
specifically it can only be used to pay

the society evaluation Committee Fund
 
05:27:10.730 --> 05:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
are to be funded through Appropriations
 
05:27:13.430 --> 05:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
from the general fund and so that would
 
05:27:15.788 --> 05:27:15.798 align:start position:0%
mean that in a scenario where you have
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
no filing fee for a very small filing
 
05:27:22.490 --> 05:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
fee you would have to have general fund
 
05:27:26.270 --> 05:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
money available to support the the
 
05:27:29.150 --> 05:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
proceedings related to that
 
05:27:31.550 --> 05:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature provided Appropriations
 
05:27:34.970 --> 05:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
in this biennium for anticipated filing
 
05:27:37.490 --> 05:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
fees during the biennium but it did not
 
05:27:39.770 --> 05:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
provide any general fund appropriation
 
05:27:42.590 --> 05:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
for any cost of the committee or for
 
05:27:44.868 --> 05:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
proceedings that occur without a filing
 
05:27:48.050 --> 05:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
fee or with a small filing fee
 
05:27:50.390 --> 05:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
and so that brings us to this bill and
 
05:27:52.368 --> 05:27:52.378 align:start position:0%
its implications for the operations of
 
05:27:53.570 --> 05:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:27:55.310 --> 05:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
the decision about what is an
 
05:27:56.930 --> 05:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
appropriate fee for a particular
 
05:27:59.208 --> 05:27:59.218 align:start position:0%
proceeding is a policy decision that is
 
05:28:00.830 --> 05:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
wholly within the purview of the
 
05:28:03.350 --> 05:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
legislature I am not here to take a
 
05:28:05.208 --> 05:28:05.218 align:start position:0%
position on whether a fee is appropriate
 
05:28:08.330 --> 05:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
or not from a policy perspective and I
 
05:28:10.490 --> 05:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
certainly understand the policy reasons
 
05:28:13.670 --> 05:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
for having a low or no filing fee to
 
05:28:16.788 --> 05:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
make access to the SEC process easier
 
05:28:19.850 --> 05:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
but I am here to to explain is the
 
05:28:22.070 --> 05:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
implication of the current funding
 
05:28:24.470 --> 05:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
scheme and how the language before you
 
05:28:28.490 --> 05:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
may impact committee operations
 
05:28:30.410 --> 05:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
when there are proceedings that do not
 
05:28:33.288 --> 05:28:33.298 align:start position:0%
have filing fees or have very small fees
 
05:28:35.570 --> 05:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
like what's proposed here related to the
 
05:28:38.330 --> 05:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling proceeding and there
 
05:28:39.890 --> 05:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
has been no appropriation of General
 
05:28:42.288 --> 05:28:42.298 align:start position:0%
funds the committee is still required by
 
05:28:44.270 --> 05:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
the law to hold the related proceedings
 
05:28:47.090 --> 05:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
but has little or no funding to do so
 
05:28:50.390 --> 05:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the same thing applies to what
 
05:28:52.788 --> 05:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
chairman Bose was just talking about in
 
05:28:55.788 --> 05:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
scenarios where we have substantial post
 
05:28:55.798 --> 05:28:57.730 align:start position:0%
scenarios where we have substantial post
certificate

05:28:57.730 --> 05:28:57.740 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
05:29:01.368 --> 05:29:01.378 align:start position:0%
issues those proceedings don't come with
 
05:29:04.490 --> 05:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
any fee at all and so
 
05:29:06.650 --> 05:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
frankly operation of the committee
 
05:29:09.050 --> 05:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
without funding is difficult or
 
05:29:11.810 --> 05:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
impossible particularly in light of RSA
 
05:29:14.868 --> 05:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
9 colon 19 which prohibits me from
 
05:29:16.368 --> 05:29:16.378 align:start position:0%
spending money that hasn't been
 
05:29:16.378 --> 05:29:17.990 align:start position:0%
spending money that hasn't been
appropriated

05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
05:29:20.090 --> 05:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
the committee cannot meet without public
 
05:29:22.910 --> 05:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
members pursuant to the statute and they
 
05:29:24.948 --> 05:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
are required by Statute to be paid for
 
05:29:27.948 --> 05:29:27.958 align:start position:0%
all of their time on any project
 
05:29:29.510 --> 05:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
the committee also has training
 
05:29:31.550 --> 05:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
requirements that are not related to any
 
05:29:34.250 --> 05:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
particular project and what and what I
 
05:29:35.628 --> 05:29:35.638 align:start position:0%
just mentioned which has been an even
 
05:29:37.910 --> 05:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
larger funding issue is the post
 
05:29:39.770 --> 05:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
certificate proceedings related to
 
05:29:42.770 --> 05:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
compliance and complaints those don't
 
05:29:45.350 --> 05:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
have any related fee that can fund the
 
05:29:47.810 --> 05:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
related proceedings but do take up a lot
 
05:29:48.830 --> 05:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
of time
 
05:29:51.110 --> 05:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
this is a long way of say saying the
 
05:29:53.030 --> 05:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee has significant and important
 
05:29:56.270 --> 05:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but without fees or
 
05:29:58.310 --> 05:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
without fees that cover the costs of
 
05:30:01.490 --> 05:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
those proceedings or general funds it
 
05:30:04.730 --> 05:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
has no way to support those operations
 
05:30:06.770 --> 05:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
and lastly I wanted to point out this is
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
just a technical issue the registration
 
05:30:11.930 --> 05:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
the legislation strikes the reference to
 
05:30:14.030 --> 05:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
the three-member subcommittees related
 
05:30:16.730 --> 05:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
to these types of petitions initially
 
05:30:18.650 --> 05:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
this was understood to be intended to
 
05:30:20.690 --> 05:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
remove the three-member subcommittee as
 
05:30:24.288 --> 05:30:24.298 align:start position:0%
an option for such petitions which would
 
05:30:26.448 --> 05:30:26.458 align:start position:0%
potentially exacerbate the funding issue
 
05:30:28.190 --> 05:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
because you would have to have a full
 
05:30:31.010 --> 05:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
committee or a larger committee for
 
05:30:33.230 --> 05:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
these type of proceedings upon further
 
05:30:35.390 --> 05:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
review it appears that the existing
 
05:30:37.730 --> 05:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
statute for establishing subcommittees
 
05:30:40.070 --> 05:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
would still permit the use of three
 
05:30:42.230 --> 05:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
three member subcommittees for such
 
05:30:44.288 --> 05:30:44.298 align:start position:0%
petitions even with the language
 
05:30:47.390 --> 05:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
stricken in the fee Section I raise that
 
05:30:49.070 --> 05:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
point as a point of clarity just to
 
05:30:50.810 --> 05:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
determine whether the legislation was
 
05:30:52.910 --> 05:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
intended to eliminate the ability to use
 
05:30:56.090 --> 05:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
read member subcommittees and if so to
 
05:30:58.190 --> 05:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
point out that further a member a
 
05:30:59.990 --> 05:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
further Amendment of the statute would
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
be necessary I believe if that were the
 
05:31:03.120 --> 05:31:04.368 align:start position:0%
be necessary I believe if that were the
intent

05:31:04.368 --> 05:31:04.378 align:start position:0%
intent
 
05:31:07.670 --> 05:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
I I'm happy to take any questions on any
 
05:31:11.330 --> 05:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:13.310 --> 05:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Martin we appreciate that
 
05:31:16.128 --> 05:31:16.138 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair recognizes
 
05:31:18.890 --> 05:31:18.900 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas for a question
 
05:31:21.350 --> 05:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
05:31:21.360 --> 05:31:23.150 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
question

05:31:23.150 --> 05:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:31:25.550 --> 05:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's a related question what we've been
 
05:31:28.490 --> 05:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
talking about I was going to uh
 
05:31:32.708 --> 05:31:32.718 align:start position:0%
part of it is what has been your yearly
 
05:31:36.948 --> 05:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
budget for the SEC and
 
05:31:39.830 --> 05:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and what are your expectations for
 
05:31:41.750 --> 05:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
your your future requests for election
 
05:31:41.760 --> 05:31:45.110 align:start position:0%
your your future requests for election
budget

05:31:45.110 --> 05:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:48.288 --> 05:31:48.298 align:start position:0%
well our so the what was appropriated in
 
05:31:50.270 --> 05:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
the biennium is very different from what
 
05:31:52.930 --> 05:31:52.940 align:start position:0%
we have actually spent and in large part
 
05:31:56.750 --> 05:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
that is related to the
 
05:31:59.390 --> 05:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
um number of proceedings that have been
 
05:31:59.400 --> 05:32:00.530 align:start position:0%
um number of proceedings that have been
filed

05:32:00.530 --> 05:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
filed
 
05:32:03.708 --> 05:32:03.718 align:start position:0%
which have not been very many and so the
 
05:32:06.650 --> 05:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
fees that have come in have been
 
05:32:10.128 --> 05:32:10.138 align:start position:0%
um minor so the original appropriation
 
05:32:14.990 --> 05:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 20 was 500 000 and and I
 
05:32:16.850 --> 05:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
believe that we spent
 
05:32:19.970 --> 05:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
um under 250
 
05:32:23.090 --> 05:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
000 with a proceeding that went on and
 
05:32:25.010 --> 05:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
with at the time we had a full-time
 
05:32:25.020 --> 05:32:26.868 align:start position:0%
with at the time we had a full-time
administrator

05:32:26.868 --> 05:32:26.878 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
05:32:28.550 --> 05:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
um the administrator recently took a
 
05:32:31.070 --> 05:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
position in another state agency and so
 
05:32:33.170 --> 05:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't have an administrator
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
so those costs have been reduced for
 
05:32:37.190 --> 05:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
this year
 
05:32:37.200 --> 05:32:38.690 align:start position:0%
this year
um

05:32:38.690 --> 05:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:41.208 --> 05:32:41.218 align:start position:0%
I expect that we're going to be even
 
05:32:43.010 --> 05:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
lower than that in what's actually
 
05:32:45.350 --> 05:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
expended but I'm
 
05:32:47.390 --> 05:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
in the process of going to the fiscal
 
05:32:49.550 --> 05:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
committee to attempt to get some funding
 
05:32:54.948 --> 05:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:58.190 --> 05:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
okay you need any follow-up
 
05:33:01.190 --> 05:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
no but you mentioned in fiscal year in
 
05:33:03.530 --> 05:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
20 and 21
 
05:33:06.170 --> 05:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
now if I was asking about fiscal year 19
 
05:33:09.350 --> 05:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
or 18 would those figures be affected by
 
05:33:11.990 --> 05:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
I believe those were years where you had
 
05:33:14.448 --> 05:33:14.458 align:start position:0%
a lot of meetings involving more than
 
05:33:17.330 --> 05:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
the past and those types of sites could
 
05:33:19.430 --> 05:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
you give us some insight as to what do
 
05:33:21.830 --> 05:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
those years cost
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
I don't have the um the budgets for
 
05:33:25.970 --> 05:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
those in front of me and I actually
 
05:33:28.670 --> 05:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
joined the Public Utilities Commission
 
05:33:31.010 --> 05:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
and the site evaluation committee at the
 
05:33:33.890 --> 05:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
end of 2019 but what I can tell you is
 
05:33:36.550 --> 05:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
that in the biennium the prior biennium
 
05:33:39.590 --> 05:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
05:33:43.250 --> 05:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
um provided for 480 000 from the
 
05:33:46.368 --> 05:33:46.378 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund to be used by the
 
05:33:50.350 --> 05:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
SEC and I believe that approximately
 
05:33:52.368 --> 05:33:52.378 align:start position:0%
three hundred and eighty thousand
 
05:33:54.770 --> 05:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
dollars of of those funds were actually
 
05:33:58.850 --> 05:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
used by the SEC to accomplish its tasks
 
05:34:02.150 --> 05:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
so in addition to what it got for what I
 
05:34:04.730 --> 05:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
understand were be were significantly
 
05:34:07.730 --> 05:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
more proceedings during those years the
 
05:34:11.090 --> 05:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
fees related to those there was also
 
05:34:12.830 --> 05:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
um almost four hundred thousand dollars
 
05:34:15.830 --> 05:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
in other funding sources that was used
 
05:34:19.368 --> 05:34:19.378 align:start position:0%
to keep this process going and so in
 
05:34:22.730 --> 05:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
this biennium we did not not have that
 
05:34:25.070 --> 05:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
access to the
 
05:34:28.910 --> 05:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund I did go to fiscal
 
05:34:28.920 --> 05:34:29.690 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund I did go to fiscal
um

05:34:29.690 --> 05:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:32.628 --> 05:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
earlier in or at the end of the last
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to to get some funding for
 
05:34:38.810 --> 05:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
the administrator position because there
 
05:34:40.910 --> 05:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
was no funding for that
 
05:34:40.920 --> 05:34:41.750 align:start position:0%
was no funding for that
um

05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:44.570 --> 05:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
and so the costs are greatly reduced
 
05:34:46.850 --> 05:34:46.860 align:start position:0%
obviously because we have
 
05:34:46.860 --> 05:34:47.650 align:start position:0%
obviously because we have
um

05:34:47.650 --> 05:34:47.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:50.810 --> 05:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
not as many filings that makes sense but
 
05:34:53.628 --> 05:34:53.638 align:start position:0%
what what I will say is as uh the chair
 
05:34:57.830 --> 05:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
pointed out there has been a lot of post
 
05:35:01.448 --> 05:35:01.458 align:start position:0%
certificate work related to
 
05:35:06.050 --> 05:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
existing projects and those um
 
05:35:08.570 --> 05:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
do not come with a fee and I do want to
 
05:35:10.550 --> 05:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
point to follow up on someone else's
 
05:35:14.288 --> 05:35:14.298 align:start position:0%
question about enforcement the statute
 
05:35:14.298 --> 05:35:16.270 align:start position:0%
question about enforcement the statute
RSA

05:35:16.270 --> 05:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
05:35:20.208 --> 05:35:20.218 align:start position:0%
162h12 which is entitled enforcement
 
05:35:23.930 --> 05:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
specifically provides for a process
 
05:35:23.940 --> 05:35:25.310 align:start position:0%
specifically provides for a process
whereby

05:35:25.310 --> 05:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
whereby
 
05:35:25.320 --> 05:35:26.510 align:start position:0%
whereby
um

05:35:26.510 --> 05:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:29.690 --> 05:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
someone can come forward about a
 
05:35:32.990 --> 05:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
violation of a certificate and the
 
05:35:33.000 --> 05:35:34.090 align:start position:0%
violation of a certificate and the
committee

05:35:34.090 --> 05:35:34.100 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:35:37.010 --> 05:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
or the administrator as designee
 
05:35:37.020 --> 05:35:38.930 align:start position:0%
or the administrator as designee
historically

05:35:38.930 --> 05:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
historically
 
05:35:41.150 --> 05:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh can determine whether the term or
 
05:35:43.128 --> 05:35:43.138 align:start position:0%
condition of the certificate is being
 
05:35:44.690 --> 05:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
violated then there's a there's an
 
05:35:46.550 --> 05:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process related to that
 
05:35:48.708 --> 05:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
that must follow
 
05:35:51.470 --> 05:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
um and that process does not have a fee
 
05:35:53.810 --> 05:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh and so
 
05:35:56.150 --> 05:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
I think part of the concern there was
 
05:35:58.970 --> 05:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
that that can be designated to the
 
05:36:01.430 --> 05:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
administrator we don't currently have an
 
05:36:03.170 --> 05:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
administrator but the discussions with
 
05:36:07.070 --> 05:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
the committee most recently were that um
 
05:36:10.070 --> 05:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
they similarly felt that the committee
 
05:36:14.868 --> 05:36:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:17.270 --> 05:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair recognizes
 
05:36:19.250 --> 05:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
representative Callie Pitts for a
 
05:36:19.260 --> 05:36:28.128 align:start position:0%
representative Callie Pitts for a
question

05:36:28.128 --> 05:36:28.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:28.138 --> 05:36:30.830 align:start position:0%
 
about

05:36:30.830 --> 05:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:33.230 --> 05:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
something you just said that you have no
 
05:36:35.570 --> 05:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
administrator so what happens to these
 
05:36:40.250 --> 05:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
complaints does someone else handle them
 
05:36:42.590 --> 05:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
these complaints about non-certificate
 
05:36:42.600 --> 05:36:44.628 align:start position:0%
these complaints about non-certificate
compliance

05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
05:36:47.090 --> 05:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
yes so we did have an administrator for
 
05:36:49.490 --> 05:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
most of the last calendar year but
 
05:36:52.128 --> 05:36:52.138 align:start position:0%
without an administrator
 
05:36:54.530 --> 05:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
um it is definitely a struggle because
 
05:36:57.170 --> 05:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
that really leaves only the chair of the
 
05:37:00.530 --> 05:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee as the sole
 
05:37:03.170 --> 05:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
remaining member of the agency so to
 
05:37:05.510 --> 05:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
speak and that uh chair as you have seen
 
05:37:07.970 --> 05:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
today has lots of responsibilities
 
05:37:09.770 --> 05:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
related to the Public Utilities
 
05:37:09.780 --> 05:37:11.208 align:start position:0%
related to the Public Utilities
Commission

05:37:11.208 --> 05:37:11.218 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
05:37:14.890 --> 05:37:14.900 align:start position:0%
um but no we continue to schedule
 
05:37:17.448 --> 05:37:17.458 align:start position:0%
meetings and hold those I think the
 
05:37:19.310 --> 05:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
funding issue is really
 
05:37:22.670 --> 05:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
the biggest problem uh because that
 
05:37:25.070 --> 05:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
impairs the ability to hold proceedings
 
05:37:27.530 --> 05:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
if you don't have funding I I will say
 
05:37:31.010 --> 05:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
it is a strain for sure to not have
 
05:37:33.350 --> 05:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
staff or a consultant or anything but
 
05:37:36.050 --> 05:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
again those require funding
 
05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
I may I follow up
 
05:37:41.628 --> 05:37:41.638 align:start position:0%
I think you asked two questions didn't
 
05:37:43.430 --> 05:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
you nope
 
05:37:45.190 --> 05:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up
 
05:37:51.948 --> 05:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
follow-up would be as as things are now
 
05:37:54.470 --> 05:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
um this adjudicative process that you
 
05:37:57.770 --> 05:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
talked about that costs nothing when
 
05:38:01.550 --> 05:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
does the declaratory judgment kick in is
 
05:38:03.470 --> 05:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
that a second appeal of that
 
05:38:07.250 --> 05:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:10.250 --> 05:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
so they're really two different things
 
05:38:13.128 --> 05:38:13.138 align:start position:0%
um a declaratory ruling is a specific
 
05:38:16.310 --> 05:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
request to determine whether
 
05:38:18.410 --> 05:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
um the committee's rules are applicable
 
05:38:18.420 --> 05:38:19.850 align:start position:0%
um the committee's rules are applicable
or

05:38:19.850 --> 05:38:19.860 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:38:21.410 --> 05:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
um an order is applicable and so
 
05:38:23.090 --> 05:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
arguably you could speak to a
 
05:38:25.190 --> 05:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
certificate through that process a
 
05:38:28.550 --> 05:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
specific request as to applicability the
 
05:38:30.830 --> 05:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement Provisions are really
 
05:38:32.990 --> 05:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
related to
 
05:38:35.530 --> 05:38:35.540 align:start position:0%
um you know are you complying with your
 
05:38:37.970 --> 05:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
obligations under the certificate and
 
05:38:41.090 --> 05:38:41.100 align:start position:0%
and when we say no cost I I want to
 
05:38:43.128 --> 05:38:43.138 align:start position:0%
clarify that there is a cost because we
 
05:38:45.770 --> 05:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
have to pay for all of the costs
 
05:38:47.690 --> 05:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
relating to the proceeding there's this
 
05:38:49.250 --> 05:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
stenographer I think the last time we
 
05:38:51.288 --> 05:38:51.298 align:start position:0%
had a meeting that was hundreds and
 
05:38:53.570 --> 05:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
hundreds of dollars and then the public
 
05:38:55.670 --> 05:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
members and amongst other things so
 
05:38:57.770 --> 05:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
there's a cost it's just there's no fee
 
05:39:00.170 --> 05:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
and and that's the same for all of the
 
05:39:02.270 --> 05:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
post certificate
 
05:39:04.610 --> 05:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
um processes this statute does not
 
05:39:08.390 --> 05:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
contemplate a fee related to the those
 
05:39:11.930 --> 05:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
um or really any any post certificate
 
05:39:14.510 --> 05:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
compliance thank you
 
05:39:17.448 --> 05:39:17.458 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative pamola is
 
05:39:19.850 --> 05:39:19.860 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question yes chairman
 
05:39:20.690 --> 05:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:39:22.750 --> 05:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
or provide your testimony
 
05:39:25.190 --> 05:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to understand when
 
05:39:26.690 --> 05:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
somebody makes a petition for a
 
05:39:30.350 --> 05:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling on your end do you
 
05:39:34.970 --> 05:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
have a one one person multiple people
 
05:39:37.310 --> 05:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
can you give any kind of explanation of
 
05:39:39.948 --> 05:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
what kind of man hours it takes you all
 
05:39:43.310 --> 05:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
to attend to that petition just so we
 
05:39:45.470 --> 05:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
can understand what it what the work is
 
05:39:47.628 --> 05:39:47.638 align:start position:0%
on yours
 
05:39:49.850 --> 05:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
I think it really depends upon what the
 
05:39:52.070 --> 05:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
petition is we haven't had one since I
 
05:39:54.010 --> 05:39:54.020 align:start position:0%
joined but I did dig into the history
 
05:39:57.170 --> 05:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the ones that I found
 
05:40:01.128 --> 05:40:01.138 align:start position:0%
the total cost for the um proceeding was
 
05:40:03.770 --> 05:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
six thousand dollars so I'm not sure
 
05:40:05.570 --> 05:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
exactly what made that up but most of
 
05:40:07.550 --> 05:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
these things take
 
05:40:10.788 --> 05:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
um you know staff time if you have staff
 
05:40:12.590 --> 05:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
if you don't have staff obviously
 
05:40:14.330 --> 05:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
there's no additional cost because the
 
05:40:14.340 --> 05:40:15.110 align:start position:0%
there's no additional cost because the
chair

05:40:15.110 --> 05:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:40:15.120 --> 05:40:16.070 align:start position:0%
chair
um

05:40:16.070 --> 05:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:18.708 --> 05:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
gets paid through the salary
 
05:40:21.050 --> 05:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
um but you have to set up
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
the proceeding you have to have a
 
05:40:24.890 --> 05:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
stenographer present those are not
 
05:40:26.810 --> 05:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
employees those are people that we have
 
05:40:28.970 --> 05:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
to hire to bring in
 
05:40:30.770 --> 05:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
um and then the public members get paid
 
05:40:33.230 --> 05:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
for all of their time for Preparation
 
05:40:36.890 --> 05:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
and attendance and agency members get
 
05:40:38.690 --> 05:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
paid for a certain amount of their time
 
05:40:40.070 --> 05:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
depending on the length of the
 
05:40:41.570 --> 05:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
proceeding so
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like there have not
 
05:40:45.470 --> 05:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
historically been a lot of petitions for
 
05:40:49.128 --> 05:40:49.138 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling but that they have
 
05:40:52.610 --> 05:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
been not inconsequential certainly not a
 
05:40:55.628 --> 05:40:55.638 align:start position:0%
significant in cost as some of the large
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
applications for certificate
 
05:40:58.798 --> 05:41:05.930 align:start position:0%
applications for certificate
recommended

05:41:05.930 --> 05:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:08.690 --> 05:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question
 
05:41:10.910 --> 05:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um thank you Miss Martin for
 
05:41:12.590 --> 05:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
taking our questions
 
05:41:14.750 --> 05:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
um so I have um
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
can you explain to us a little bit about
 
05:41:19.570 --> 05:41:19.580 align:start position:0%
since this bill is partially about
 
05:41:22.970 --> 05:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
access by the public to this procedure
 
05:41:26.230 --> 05:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
after the license has been
 
05:41:29.930 --> 05:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
awarded can you uh give us a little bit
 
05:41:32.690 --> 05:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
of an insight about what is the Public's
 
05:41:35.930 --> 05:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
role in that whole process before and
 
05:41:38.628 --> 05:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
after the license is greased and what is
 
05:41:41.270 --> 05:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
the rule of the uh the council for the
 
05:41:41.280 --> 05:41:44.150 align:start position:0%
the rule of the uh the council for the
public

05:41:44.150 --> 05:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:46.490 --> 05:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
that's a good question so counsel for
 
05:41:47.868 --> 05:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
the public
 
05:41:51.230 --> 05:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
um in these post certificate filing type
 
05:41:54.410 --> 05:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
of scenarios generally is not involved
 
05:41:56.510 --> 05:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
the council for the public plays a
 
05:41:59.628 --> 05:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
significant role in the application and
 
05:42:03.350 --> 05:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
certificate uh review process and and
 
05:42:05.330 --> 05:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
sort of serves as
 
05:42:08.930 --> 05:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
an advocate for the public and
 
05:42:10.850 --> 05:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
um you know brings up issues that are
 
05:42:12.650 --> 05:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
important and might not otherwise wise
 
05:42:15.470 --> 05:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
be brought up but generally their role
 
05:42:18.288 --> 05:42:18.298 align:start position:0%
kind of drops out after the certificate
 
05:42:20.030 --> 05:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
is issued
 
05:42:22.730 --> 05:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
um accessed by the public
 
05:42:25.850 --> 05:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
so it depends upon whether you're in an
 
05:42:28.010 --> 05:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
adjudicative phase or if you're holding
 
05:42:30.530 --> 05:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
a public meeting all of those should be
 
05:42:32.448 --> 05:42:32.458 align:start position:0%
accessible to the public and are
 
05:42:34.910 --> 05:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to be posted consistent with
 
05:42:38.448 --> 05:42:38.458 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a and so the public can always
 
05:42:41.868 --> 05:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
attend any of those things and we are
 
05:42:45.050 --> 05:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
required by rule and do hear public
 
05:42:48.288 --> 05:42:48.298 align:start position:0%
comment at any proceeding
 
05:42:52.850 --> 05:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
um and so it it varies depending upon
 
05:42:55.850 --> 05:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
where we are in the process and what
 
05:42:59.330 --> 05:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
exactly is before the the committee
 
05:43:03.170 --> 05:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman okay follow up uh
 
05:43:05.570 --> 05:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
just just briefly uh on the question of
 
05:43:08.510 --> 05:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
funding uh if I heard correctly that
 
05:43:10.970 --> 05:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
we've had only like three such
 
05:43:15.050 --> 05:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
declaratory judgments since 2015. if I
 
05:43:16.490 --> 05:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
look at the amount of money that would
 
05:43:19.850 --> 05:43:19.860 align:start position:0%
be raised that maybe compromises uh
 
05:43:22.310 --> 05:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
comes up to about two percent of your
 
05:43:24.110 --> 05:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
annual budget
 
05:43:26.030 --> 05:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
I can't believe that that would be
 
05:43:29.390 --> 05:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
significant impact on your budget if
 
05:43:32.270 --> 05:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
that were lowered however maybe I'm
 
05:43:34.970 --> 05:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:42.410 --> 05:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:42.420 --> 05:43:43.730 align:start position:0%
 
evolved

05:43:43.730 --> 05:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
evolved
 
05:43:46.910 --> 05:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
um as I said I'm I'm new to this um
 
05:43:48.590 --> 05:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
scene but
 
05:43:50.570 --> 05:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
um they're supposed to be reflective of
 
05:43:52.610 --> 05:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
the actual cost and as I just told you
 
05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
the six thousand dollars for the one
 
05:43:57.590 --> 05:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
that that I dug up so less than the
 
05:44:00.048 --> 05:44:00.058 align:start position:0%
current statutory fee
 
05:44:00.058 --> 05:44:01.930 align:start position:0%
current statutory fee
um

05:44:01.930 --> 05:44:01.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:06.190 --> 05:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
but the issue isn't really how
 
05:44:09.410 --> 05:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
Whittle the fears versus how much it
 
05:44:12.110 --> 05:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
costs it's that if we have no funding
 
05:44:15.110 --> 05:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
then I don't have any means by which to
 
05:44:17.810 --> 05:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
legally and lawfully establish any
 
05:44:20.030 --> 05:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
proceeding and so you know I really am
 
05:44:23.330 --> 05:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
struggling with my ability to establish
 
05:44:26.690 --> 05:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
proceedings that comply with the law yet
 
05:44:29.448 --> 05:44:29.458 align:start position:0%
I don't have any funding for them it's a
 
05:44:31.190 --> 05:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
difficult position to be in I think
 
05:44:33.590 --> 05:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
particularly for someone like me who is
 
05:44:36.410 --> 05:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
well aware of the statutes that prohibit
 
05:44:36.420 --> 05:44:37.010 align:start position:0%
well aware of the statutes that prohibit
um

05:44:37.010 --> 05:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:38.868 --> 05:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
public employees from spending money
 
05:44:41.090 --> 05:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
that has not been appropriated
 
05:44:42.948 --> 05:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:44:44.868 --> 05:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Martin we have kept Miss
 
05:44:47.868 --> 05:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
Martin now for a full 20 minutes we have
 
05:44:49.730 --> 05:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
four additional speakers who want to
 
05:44:51.590 --> 05:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
speak at this public hearing
 
05:44:55.310 --> 05:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to ask the three people who
 
05:44:57.470 --> 05:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
have their hands raised if you hold your
 
05:45:00.350 --> 05:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
questions until after the the next
 
05:45:02.810 --> 05:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
series of speakers
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:10.670 --> 05:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
okay in that case
 
05:45:15.170 --> 05:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
I will now call on Lisa linones a member
 
05:45:17.868 --> 05:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
of the public who wants to testify in
 
05:45:24.470 --> 05:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:27.410 --> 05:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
she has written testimony
 
05:45:29.390 --> 05:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
this lenos has submitted written
 
05:45:35.750 --> 05:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:38.090 --> 05:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr chair I was I was muted can
 
05:45:39.410 --> 05:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
you hear me okay now
 
05:45:43.070 --> 05:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
yes oh good thank you uh Mr chairman
 
05:45:44.390 --> 05:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you very
 
05:45:46.610 --> 05:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
much for the opportunity to speak I have
 
05:45:48.830 --> 05:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
been involved with the SEC process as a
 
05:45:50.448 --> 05:45:50.458 align:start position:0%
member of the public for many years
 
05:45:55.548 --> 05:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
dating back to 2006 so before SB 245 was
 
05:45:58.430 --> 05:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
passed at which time there were no fees
 
05:46:02.930 --> 05:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
and now after the fees so I I have some
 
05:46:05.330 --> 05:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
responses is some of the questions that
 
05:46:07.010 --> 05:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
might differ from what you've heard so
 
05:46:07.020 --> 05:46:07.788 align:start position:0%
might differ from what you've heard so
far

05:46:07.788 --> 05:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
far
 
05:46:07.798 --> 05:46:08.690 align:start position:0%
far
um

05:46:08.690 --> 05:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:10.610 --> 05:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
because my firm belief that when the
 
05:46:12.530 --> 05:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
legislature introduced the fees to the
 
05:46:15.288 --> 05:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
SEC process it never intended for
 
05:46:17.990 --> 05:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
non-corporate entities to face a
 
05:46:20.930 --> 05:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
financial barrier that and this is
 
05:46:24.670 --> 05:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
evidenced by the language in RSA
 
05:46:28.730 --> 05:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
162h8a that explicitly removes the fee
 
05:46:30.350 --> 05:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
of ten thousand five hundred dollars
 
05:46:32.628 --> 05:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
when the condition petitioners for
 
05:46:34.190 --> 05:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
committee jurisdiction are
 
05:46:36.948 --> 05:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities registered voters or
 
05:46:38.990 --> 05:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
abiding communities
 
05:46:41.868 --> 05:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
so in this in essence in the scenario
 
05:46:43.910 --> 05:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
where the legislature understood the
 
05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
petitioner to be a member of the public
 
05:46:49.850 --> 05:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
no fees applied it's also my belief that
 
05:46:51.788 --> 05:46:51.798 align:start position:0%
at the time when the fees were adopted
 
05:46:54.530 --> 05:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
there was no consideration or thought
 
05:46:57.410 --> 05:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
that a declaratory ruling would be a
 
05:46:59.150 --> 05:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
petition that would be filed by members
 
05:47:01.430 --> 05:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the public and frankly when I went
 
05:47:03.530 --> 05:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
through this the process when I was when
 
05:47:06.590 --> 05:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
I watched and participated in the 245
 
05:47:09.110 --> 05:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh deliberations
 
05:47:11.030 --> 05:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
I didn't think of it either and didn't
 
05:47:13.730 --> 05:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
think it would come up and um and let me
 
05:47:17.570 --> 05:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
explain why the really the motivation in
 
05:47:18.970 --> 05:47:18.980 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
05:47:24.910 --> 05:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
behind HB 624 and it dates back to 2018
 
05:47:28.128 --> 05:47:28.138 align:start position:0%
in that case the SEC administrator was
 
05:47:29.390 --> 05:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
in place
 
05:47:32.090 --> 05:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
he had made a determination about a
 
05:47:33.770 --> 05:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
condition of approval there was a
 
05:47:37.990 --> 05:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
certificate granted for Antrim win
 
05:47:41.750 --> 05:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the and there was a
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
question by members of the public as to
 
05:47:45.110 --> 05:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not one of the conditions had
 
05:47:47.690 --> 05:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
been properly met
 
05:47:51.230 --> 05:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
they filed a complaint with the SEC the
 
05:47:51.240 --> 05:47:52.970 align:start position:0%
they filed a complaint with the SEC the
administrator

05:47:52.970 --> 05:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
05:47:56.208 --> 05:47:56.218 align:start position:0%
it had responded to the complaint and in
 
05:47:58.310 --> 05:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
her response she stated
 
05:48:00.530 --> 05:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
that and if you bear with me for one
 
05:48:03.350 --> 05:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
second I'll get the exact wording
 
05:48:06.230 --> 05:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I had to have to close one
 
05:48:09.230 --> 05:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
window and in fact uh she she stated
 
05:48:12.470 --> 05:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
that her determination was Final that
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:18.590 --> 05:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
so that what she wrote was according
 
05:48:20.690 --> 05:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
that her determination was fine on that
 
05:48:22.970 --> 05:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
according to the SEC committee it will
 
05:48:24.708 --> 05:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
not hold a hearing
 
05:48:26.150 --> 05:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
on this
 
05:48:28.730 --> 05:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
on the complaint and to the extent you
 
05:48:30.590 --> 05:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
seek additional relief from the site
 
05:48:33.350 --> 05:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee you should file for
 
05:48:36.470 --> 05:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
a declaratory ruling in other words we
 
05:48:39.170 --> 05:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
had the only way we could get relief
 
05:48:42.590 --> 05:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
from the administrator's decision
 
05:48:45.590 --> 05:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
was to pay three thousand dollars or ten
 
05:48:47.448 --> 05:48:47.458 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred dollars
 
05:48:48.948 --> 05:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
to get before the site evaluation
 
05:48:51.288 --> 05:48:51.298 align:start position:0%
committee we were shocked by that
 
05:48:53.510 --> 05:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
decision because it was never our
 
05:48:56.690 --> 05:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
understanding or expectation that an
 
05:48:58.850 --> 05:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
administrator would have the authority
 
05:49:01.430 --> 05:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
the single authority to make a
 
05:49:04.010 --> 05:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
determination on that and that we would
 
05:49:06.590 --> 05:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
have to pay money to appeal a decision
 
05:49:07.970 --> 05:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
of the administrator
 
05:49:11.570 --> 05:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
so that is the well the hope is that the
 
05:49:13.490 --> 05:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
fee would be eliminated if that is going
 
05:49:15.410 --> 05:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
to be the process we follow into the
 
05:49:15.420 --> 05:49:16.368 align:start position:0%
to be the process we follow into the
future

05:49:16.368 --> 05:49:16.378 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:49:18.708 --> 05:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
so in general a petition for declaratory
 
05:49:21.170 --> 05:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
ruling is filed when a party has a
 
05:49:22.610 --> 05:49:22.620 align:start position:0%
specific question regarding how a
 
05:49:25.368 --> 05:49:25.378 align:start position:0%
committee interprets Provisions our RSA
 
05:49:29.150 --> 05:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
162h or any of the SEC rules introducing
 
05:49:31.270 --> 05:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
the lower fees which was stated today
 
05:49:34.010 --> 05:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
and apply it uniformly I don't think
 
05:49:36.590 --> 05:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
anyone should pay significant quantities
 
05:49:38.150 --> 05:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
of money
 
05:49:40.070 --> 05:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
in order to get access to their
 
05:49:42.110 --> 05:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
government especially when the
 
05:49:44.208 --> 05:49:44.218 align:start position:0%
government especially when the question
 
05:49:47.208 --> 05:49:47.218 align:start position:0%
is arising as to confusion over what the
 
05:49:49.250 --> 05:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
rules say what the actions of the
 
05:49:52.070 --> 05:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
committee are or its administrator we
 
05:49:54.110 --> 05:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
should have ready access and that was
 
05:49:57.410 --> 05:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
the expectation with 245. I do not
 
05:50:00.590 --> 05:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
foresee a regular pattern of harassing
 
05:50:03.470 --> 05:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
declaratory rulings I do not think that
 
05:50:05.510 --> 05:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
that has not was not the case before
 
05:50:09.350 --> 05:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
there were no fees and then after their
 
05:50:11.628 --> 05:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
fees there was as we heard there were
 
05:50:14.868 --> 05:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
only three cases that came up since 2015
 
05:50:16.788 --> 05:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
and one of them was the one we at
 
05:50:19.250 --> 05:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
Guardian answer when
 
05:50:22.010 --> 05:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
and then secondly that I would like to
 
05:50:24.948 --> 05:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
speak to the question of the powers of
 
05:50:26.330 --> 05:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
the administrator because that's one of
 
05:50:28.128 --> 05:50:28.138 align:start position:0%
the other clarify the clarifying
 
05:50:31.190 --> 05:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
language that um chairman both spoke of
 
05:50:33.650 --> 05:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
on the matter of the SEC administrator's
 
05:50:36.708 --> 05:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
Powers when the when the public went to
 
05:50:39.948 --> 05:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
the committee and requested relief
 
05:50:42.530 --> 05:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
the committee issued an order that
 
05:50:45.590 --> 05:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
stated as a matter of procedure seeking
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
re-hearing of a decision by the
 
05:50:49.610 --> 05:50:49.620 align:start position:0%
administrator is not proper under the
 
05:50:52.610 --> 05:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
committee's statutes and rules
 
05:50:55.430 --> 05:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
in effect the order stated this is the
 
05:50:58.190 --> 05:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
sec's OWN ruling that the
 
05:51:00.590 --> 05:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
administrator's decisions can be made
 
05:51:03.410 --> 05:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
unilaterally without public deliberation
 
05:51:06.530 --> 05:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
or apparent opportunity for appeal
 
05:51:08.030 --> 05:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
when we brought this into the attention
 
05:51:09.890 --> 05:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
of Senator Bradley who was intimately
 
05:51:13.070 --> 05:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
involved in sb245 passing
 
05:51:15.650 --> 05:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
he was surprised by this and said that
 
05:51:17.448 --> 05:51:17.458 align:start position:0%
the level of authority that appears to
 
05:51:19.010 --> 05:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
be confirmed conferred to the
 
05:51:21.250 --> 05:51:21.260 align:start position:0%
administrator is in his mind
 
05:51:23.750 --> 05:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
unprecedented in the state and contrary
 
05:51:27.288 --> 05:51:27.298 align:start position:0%
to the legislative intent of 245. we
 
05:51:29.208 --> 05:51:29.218 align:start position:0%
believe if you were if you look at the
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
language that is written even the
 
05:51:34.490 --> 05:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
current language of SB uh once I'm sorry
 
05:51:38.510 --> 05:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
RSA 162h wherein now it explicitly
 
05:51:40.548 --> 05:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
States the committee has to make a
 
05:51:42.708 --> 05:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
determination regarding whether the
 
05:51:44.448 --> 05:51:44.458 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions are met on a
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
certificate if you look at the language
 
05:51:49.610 --> 05:51:49.620 align:start position:0%
as it stands today and even the
 
05:51:53.208 --> 05:51:53.218 align:start position:0%
languages it stood before RSA 162h was
 
05:51:56.150 --> 05:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
changed by 245. there's a discrepancy
 
05:51:59.150 --> 05:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
between what the SEC rules say and what
 
05:52:02.510 --> 05:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
the and and how the SEC is operating in
 
05:52:04.788 --> 05:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
terms of conferring this level of power
 
05:52:07.070 --> 05:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
to the administrator then what the
 
05:52:09.048 --> 05:52:09.058 align:start position:0%
language of those statute actually says
 
05:52:11.810 --> 05:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
I believe it was a mistake by the SEC if
 
05:52:13.850 --> 05:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
it cost us a fortune to go to court over
 
05:52:17.390 --> 05:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
it there'd be deference to the SEC so in
 
05:52:20.330 --> 05:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
general so it was a we founded a losing
 
05:52:23.810 --> 05:52:23.820 align:start position:0%
battle so that's why we're hopeful that
 
05:52:28.090 --> 05:52:28.100 align:start position:0%
this uh bill will pass and clarify the
 
05:52:31.070 --> 05:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
authority of the administrator or the
 
05:52:32.830 --> 05:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
powers of the administrator to the SEC
 
05:52:36.708 --> 05:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
and also reduce the cost of access thank
 
05:52:36.718 --> 05:52:40.090 align:start position:0%
and also reduce the cost of access thank
you

05:52:40.090 --> 05:52:40.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:43.190 --> 05:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Ms minnows are there
 
05:52:46.090 --> 05:52:46.100 align:start position:0%
questions from Ms minnows I see one from
 
05:52:49.910 --> 05:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:50.868 --> 05:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:52:53.390 --> 05:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman uh Miss
 
05:52:56.390 --> 05:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
minnows uh would you think that it might
 
05:52:58.368 --> 05:52:58.378 align:start position:0%
be an improvement to this bill if
 
05:53:01.490 --> 05:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
instead of saying 250 dollars
 
05:53:07.610 --> 05:53:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh we would say 250 dollars were all uh
 
05:53:07.620 --> 05:53:08.448 align:start position:0%
uh we would say 250 dollars were all uh
um

05:53:08.448 --> 05:53:08.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:11.150 --> 05:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
for for non-corporate or non-business
 
05:53:11.160 --> 05:53:15.048 align:start position:0%
for for non-corporate or non-business
entities

05:53:15.048 --> 05:53:15.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:18.708 --> 05:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
oh I'm I'm sorry oh
 
05:53:21.650 --> 05:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
did you I'm sorry broke up can you I'm
 
05:53:25.128 --> 05:53:25.138 align:start position:0%
sorry sure so so would you think it
 
05:53:27.048 --> 05:53:27.058 align:start position:0%
might be an improvement to this bill if
 
05:53:29.570 --> 05:53:29.580 align:start position:0%
instead of just saying flat out 250
 
05:53:33.288 --> 05:53:33.298 align:start position:0%
dollars for a declaratory judgment it it
 
05:53:36.548 --> 05:53:36.558 align:start position:0%
would too would read 250 dollars for
 
05:53:39.948 --> 05:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
non-corporate or business entities
 
05:53:42.170 --> 05:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
that would be fine I have no problem
 
05:53:45.410 --> 05:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
with that at all in fact I and I'm quite
 
05:53:47.448 --> 05:53:47.458 align:start position:0%
certain that all of the other fees that
 
05:53:49.430 --> 05:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
are in there would only apply to the
 
05:53:52.128 --> 05:53:52.138 align:start position:0%
corporates as well so yes that would I'd
 
05:53:54.708 --> 05:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
be very comfortable with that and I if I
 
05:53:57.110 --> 05:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
may ask I would like to see that right
 
05:54:01.850 --> 05:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
now at rsa162h does allow for uh the
 
05:54:05.810 --> 05:54:05.820 align:start position:0%
committee to the SEC to increase its
 
05:54:07.910 --> 05:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
fees 20 every year I would like to see
 
05:54:12.590 --> 05:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
that 250 remain flat so not increased
 
05:54:15.170 --> 05:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
so but thank you for the question thank
 
05:54:15.180 --> 05:54:17.990 align:start position:0%
so but thank you for the question thank
you

05:54:17.990 --> 05:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:21.170 --> 05:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
okay next we have a question from
 
05:54:24.890 --> 05:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
uh representative Kat McGee
 
05:54:24.900 --> 05:54:26.330 align:start position:0%
uh representative Kat McGee
chairman

05:54:26.330 --> 05:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:54:29.030 --> 05:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
um my question is it it sounded to me
 
05:54:32.270 --> 05:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
when uh chairwoman
 
05:54:34.910 --> 05:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
um Martin was speaking that she's the
 
05:54:38.090 --> 05:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
only person currently involved on the
 
05:54:40.730 --> 05:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
SEC and so I would like an understanding
 
05:54:43.310 --> 05:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
if there's a statutory requirement as to
 
05:54:45.830 --> 05:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
how many people serve on the SEC because
 
05:54:47.690 --> 05:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
it says that a subcommittee is three
 
05:54:50.150 --> 05:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
people so I I'd like to understand what
 
05:54:51.830 --> 05:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
the structure is
 
05:54:53.690 --> 05:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for the question
 
05:54:56.448 --> 05:54:56.458 align:start position:0%
there is I believe it's I can't remember
 
05:54:58.310 --> 05:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
now which is seven or nine people but
 
05:55:01.190 --> 05:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
there is a statutory size of the
 
05:55:03.410 --> 05:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
committee and it also designates
 
05:55:05.868 --> 05:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
the agencies from which people of the
 
05:55:05.878 --> 05:55:07.730 align:start position:0%
the agencies from which people of the
SEC

05:55:07.730 --> 05:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
SEC
 
05:55:09.830 --> 05:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
um what roles they play in in the state
 
05:55:12.830 --> 05:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
and and who sits on the SEC
 
05:55:16.190 --> 05:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
the odd thing about the SEC is that it
 
05:55:19.128 --> 05:55:19.138 align:start position:0%
does not exist except when it is meeting
 
05:55:23.690 --> 05:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
per se you have so the um the chair has
 
05:55:26.150 --> 05:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
the authority to take certain actions as
 
05:55:28.670 --> 05:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
it apparently uh you know we would like
 
05:55:30.470 --> 05:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
to see this change but the admin has
 
05:55:32.690 --> 05:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
authorities as well
 
05:55:35.868 --> 05:55:35.878 align:start position:0%
um when the committee is not in in force
 
05:55:39.170 --> 05:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
or seated however
 
05:55:42.410 --> 05:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
um to the question to your question what
 
05:55:45.830 --> 05:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
happened before 2 45 was passed
 
05:55:48.970 --> 05:55:48.980 align:start position:0%
the public would issue would file
 
05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
either motions or complaints or
 
05:55:53.510 --> 05:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
something to the site evaluation
 
05:55:56.030 --> 05:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
committee the site evaluation committee
 
05:55:58.490 --> 05:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
would act on it in its entirety so for
 
05:55:59.930 --> 05:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
instance there was a compliance problem
 
05:56:02.990 --> 05:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
with Groton win which is down near
 
05:56:03.000 --> 05:56:04.128 align:start position:0%
with Groton win which is down near
um Plymouth

05:56:04.128 --> 05:56:04.138 align:start position:0%
um Plymouth
 
05:56:06.910 --> 05:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
and when that was filed the committee
 
05:56:10.368 --> 05:56:10.378 align:start position:0%
convened and dealt with the issue
 
05:56:12.410 --> 05:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
I think ultimately in that case there
 
05:56:14.750 --> 05:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
was a definitely a compliance issue and
 
05:56:17.510 --> 05:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
Groton win paid for the cost as
 
05:56:19.070 --> 05:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
generally as the case the applicant
 
05:56:21.170 --> 05:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
picks up the cost for the sec's
 
05:56:21.180 --> 05:56:23.750 align:start position:0%
picks up the cost for the sec's
activities

05:56:23.750 --> 05:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
activities
 
05:56:26.270 --> 05:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
um and so it's that that's how it did
 
05:56:29.690 --> 05:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
work I'm I'm very confused now about how
 
05:56:33.410 --> 05:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
the admin and the the chair operate well
 
05:56:35.208 --> 05:56:35.218 align:start position:0%
it sounds very much like a chicken and
 
05:56:37.250 --> 05:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
egg thing the way it was described by
 
05:56:39.470 --> 05:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
chairwoman Martin because
 
05:56:42.110 --> 05:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
it sounded as though statutorily they're
 
05:56:44.270 --> 05:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
not allowed to do work that isn't funded
 
05:56:47.270 --> 05:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
and if there isn't funding so I you know
 
05:56:48.288 --> 05:56:48.298 align:start position:0%
I mean that's what I'm trying to
 
05:56:49.850 --> 05:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
understand because I want to make sure
 
05:56:51.830 --> 05:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's not an unfunded mandate that we're
 
05:56:53.628 --> 05:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
requiring under the guise of being able
 
05:56:55.250 --> 05:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
to provide people access because that's
 
05:56:56.690 --> 05:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
how I understand what's going on is
 
05:56:59.090 --> 05:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
we're saying we want regular people to
 
05:57:02.090 --> 05:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
be able to have access to to voice their
 
05:57:03.590 --> 05:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
objections and to be able to be heard
 
05:57:06.650 --> 05:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
and to have a part in that process and I
 
05:57:08.690 --> 05:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
I think that that's all a great idea
 
05:57:11.270 --> 05:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
I've been involved myself with Ned in my
 
05:57:13.670 --> 05:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
town halls years ago up in the site
 
05:57:17.090 --> 05:57:17.100 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee rooms but but I am
 
05:57:19.368 --> 05:57:19.378 align:start position:0%
concerned that what we're doing may not
 
05:57:21.048 --> 05:57:21.058 align:start position:0%
be fixing that that may be causing
 
05:57:24.048 --> 05:57:24.058 align:start position:0%
another problem in terms of the
 
05:57:26.030 --> 05:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
um sort of gutting of the ability of the
 
05:57:28.250 --> 05:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
SEC to operate that's what I want to get
 
05:57:29.930 --> 05:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
at basically I'm not sure who could
 
05:57:33.230 --> 05:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
answer that for me but yes um can you
 
05:57:35.868 --> 05:57:35.878 align:start position:0%
hear me okay my Internet isn't unstable
 
05:57:38.868 --> 05:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
I as I understand it the members that
 
05:57:40.910 --> 05:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
sit on the committee are paid as part of
 
05:57:44.208 --> 05:57:44.218 align:start position:0%
their regular job so when they do seat
 
05:57:47.150 --> 05:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
that when they are seated they
 
05:57:49.788 --> 05:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
their salary covers their cost so it
 
05:57:51.708 --> 05:57:51.718 align:start position:0%
comes out of their respected divisions
 
05:57:54.048 --> 05:57:54.058 align:start position:0%
or agencies
 
05:57:55.850 --> 05:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
um but when there's additional work to
 
05:57:56.868 --> 05:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
be done
 
05:57:59.868 --> 05:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
that is if it's not paid by the
 
05:58:01.910 --> 05:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
applicant or the owner of the energy
 
05:58:01.920 --> 05:58:03.708 align:start position:0%
applicant or the owner of the energy
facility

05:58:03.708 --> 05:58:03.718 align:start position:0%
facility
 
05:58:05.868 --> 05:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
I don't know where the money comes from
 
05:58:11.030 --> 05:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:15.610 --> 05:58:15.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:18.410 --> 05:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
for those answers
 
05:58:18.420 --> 05:58:20.270 align:start position:0%
for those answers
um

05:58:20.270 --> 05:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:23.930 --> 05:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
we have no more hands raised so I would
 
05:58:26.628 --> 05:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
like to move on to our next presenter I
 
05:58:29.628 --> 05:58:29.638 align:start position:0%
would like to call to the
 
05:58:33.230 --> 05:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
to the Forefront Ms Lowery Lerner
 
05:58:35.930 --> 05:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
who is representing herself as a member
 
05:58:36.948 --> 05:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
of the public
 
05:58:46.970 --> 05:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:49.250 --> 05:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:58:51.650 --> 05:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
chairman those and committee members I
 
05:58:53.270 --> 05:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak to
 
05:58:55.548 --> 05:58:55.558 align:start position:0%
this bill I hope that everybody can hear
 
05:58:55.558 --> 05:58:56.628 align:start position:0%
this bill I hope that everybody can hear
me

05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:59:00.048 --> 05:59:00.058 align:start position:0%
yes perfect thank you I do have written
 
05:59:02.208 --> 05:59:02.218 align:start position:0%
testimony that I submitted hopefully
 
05:59:05.690 --> 05:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
everybody has seen it I will not go
 
05:59:07.070 --> 05:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
through it
 
05:59:09.110 --> 05:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
um word for word given that we've
 
05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
discussed many of the points that are
 
05:59:11.990 --> 05:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
contained in it but I would recommend
 
05:59:15.350 --> 05:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
that you do read it I reinforce
 
05:59:17.090 --> 05:59:17.100 align:start position:0%
everything that Lisa has said I got
 
05:59:19.250 --> 05:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
involved with the site evaluation
 
05:59:21.350 --> 05:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
committee process and all the
 
05:59:23.448 --> 05:59:23.458 align:start position:0%
legislative activities that were
 
05:59:26.690 --> 05:59:26.700 align:start position:0%
happening from 2012 on so I was very
 
05:59:31.190 --> 05:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
closely involved in SB 245 and SB 281
 
05:59:33.670 --> 05:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
which set the wind sighting guidelines
 
05:59:36.830 --> 05:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
and it's my firm belief that these were
 
05:59:40.128 --> 05:59:40.138 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that came out of
 
05:59:42.770 --> 05:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
such a lot real change that was enacted
 
05:59:46.250 --> 05:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
with SB 2485 I don't think anybody in
 
05:59:48.590 --> 05:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature or the public or
 
05:59:52.010 --> 05:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
probably at the SCC ever anticipated us
 
05:59:55.128 --> 05:59:55.138 align:start position:0%
to find ourselves in this position
 
05:59:57.250 --> 05:59:57.260 align:start position:0%
um we back in
 
06:00:00.410 --> 06:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
2012 as Lisa referred to there were some
 
06:00:02.390 --> 06:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
issues with rotten wind there were
 
06:00:04.910 --> 06:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
grievances filed by the citizens and
 
06:00:07.250 --> 06:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
almost instantly the SEC came together
 
06:00:09.890 --> 06:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
and had an adjudicative process to find
 
06:00:11.690 --> 06:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
their way through both the public
 
06:00:14.030 --> 06:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
citizens grievances as well the fire
 
06:00:15.890 --> 06:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
monster Fire Marshal had some concerns
 
06:00:17.690 --> 06:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
with the project at the time and
 
06:00:19.730 --> 06:00:19.740 align:start position:0%
everything was handled
 
06:00:19.740 --> 06:00:20.570 align:start position:0%
everything was handled
um

06:00:20.570 --> 06:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:22.610 --> 06:00:22.620 align:start position:0%
to a point where they're you know the
 
06:00:24.530 --> 06:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
parties that were aggrieved had some
 
06:00:27.230 --> 06:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
closure to that as it stands right now
 
06:00:29.448 --> 06:00:29.458 align:start position:0%
as we're seeing with antrum wind when
 
06:00:31.788 --> 06:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
there are serious issues uh when they
 
06:00:33.708 --> 06:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
had PM Monroe as the SEC administrator
 
06:00:36.230 --> 06:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
in place she was making the decisions
 
06:00:38.868 --> 06:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
without input from the committee or
 
06:00:42.048 --> 06:00:42.058 align:start position:0%
giving the opportunity for the public to
 
06:00:43.850 --> 06:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
work with the SEC committee to
 
06:00:45.590 --> 06:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
understand their concerns she was making
 
06:00:48.708 --> 06:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
as Lisa said unilateral decisions and
 
06:00:50.570 --> 06:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
when we brought that through a
 
06:00:52.730 --> 06:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling it became very
 
06:00:55.090 --> 06:00:55.100 align:start position:0%
obvious through commissioner honigberg
 
06:00:58.190 --> 06:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
that that was now the new Norm for the
 
06:01:01.310 --> 06:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
SEC process that the administrator has
 
06:01:03.590 --> 06:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
the unilateral decision-making Authority
 
06:01:06.410 --> 06:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
which again in speaking with Senator
 
06:01:09.410 --> 06:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
Bradley and being involved in sb245 and
 
06:01:12.830 --> 06:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
sb99 back years ago that was never the
 
06:01:15.128 --> 06:01:15.138 align:start position:0%
intent the intent was to
 
06:01:18.590 --> 06:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
include or incorporate public trust into
 
06:01:20.570 --> 06:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
the process give greater particip
 
06:01:23.448 --> 06:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
relation to the public the public back
 
06:01:27.170 --> 06:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
in 2012 and on time frame had a lot of
 
06:01:29.030 --> 06:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
distrust and were very concerned with
 
06:01:30.890 --> 06:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
where the state was heading and that's
 
06:01:33.170 --> 06:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
why all of these large changes came
 
06:01:35.570 --> 06:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
about unfortunately
 
06:01:38.030 --> 06:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
nobody caught these other underlying
 
06:01:40.548 --> 06:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
issues that have since come about and so
 
06:01:42.770 --> 06:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
we're asking now for this committee to
 
06:01:44.208 --> 06:01:44.218 align:start position:0%
help us in making some corrective
 
06:01:46.490 --> 06:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
actions to remedy it so that the people
 
06:01:47.868 --> 06:01:47.878 align:start position:0%
that are living in the shadows of these
 
06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
energy facilities have an Avenue when
 
06:01:52.430 --> 06:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
there's such a grievance without having
 
06:01:54.830 --> 06:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
to spend a lot of their own personal
 
06:01:56.810 --> 06:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
money to make that happen
 
06:01:59.390 --> 06:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
I'll speak directly to the particular
 
06:02:02.030 --> 06:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling that we had
 
06:02:03.890 --> 06:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
um it was determined to have a
 
06:02:06.048 --> 06:02:06.058 align:start position:0%
three-person subcommittee to hear the
 
06:02:08.990 --> 06:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
grievance and I will say the
 
06:02:10.850 --> 06:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
subcommittee came together and it was
 
06:02:13.970 --> 06:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
probably within 15 to 20 minutes as I
 
06:02:16.670 --> 06:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
recall that the decision was made to not
 
06:02:19.250 --> 06:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
hear the case and therefore the public
 
06:02:21.230 --> 06:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
had just spent three thousand dollars
 
06:02:23.750 --> 06:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
plus legal fees for something that they
 
06:02:26.270 --> 06:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
didn't even have an opportunity to voice
 
06:02:30.110 --> 06:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:33.170 --> 06:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
with that are there any questions
 
06:02:36.708 --> 06:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms Lerner before we open the
 
06:02:40.570 --> 06:02:40.580 align:start position:0%
floor to questions I am going to
 
06:02:44.048 --> 06:02:44.058 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on
 
06:02:48.650 --> 06:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
hb614 and recess that public hearing so
 
06:02:50.930 --> 06:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
that we can continue this public hearing
 
06:02:55.610 --> 06:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you now uh representative Jackie
 
06:02:58.610 --> 06:02:58.620 align:start position:0%
Kelly Pitts is recognized for a question
 
06:03:01.010 --> 06:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh Miss lerna thank you very much for
 
06:03:03.590 --> 06:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
testifying today I was around during 2
 
06:03:07.970 --> 06:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
45 and I I'm trying to
 
06:03:10.730 --> 06:03:10.740 align:start position:0%
um to get this straight in my mind I
 
06:03:12.288 --> 06:03:12.298 align:start position:0%
don't believe anybody I I believe
 
06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
everything should be able to be appealed
 
06:03:19.670 --> 06:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
but did you or the individuals who took
 
06:03:22.730 --> 06:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
the case on Groton have to pay you said
 
06:03:26.208 --> 06:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
3 000 and I thought the fee was ten
 
06:03:29.150 --> 06:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred so was it a group
 
06:03:31.490 --> 06:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
or was it an individual
 
06:03:33.048 --> 06:03:33.058 align:start position:0%
okay so there's a couple different
 
06:03:35.090 --> 06:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
things so when I mentioned Groton wind
 
06:03:38.750 --> 06:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
that was before SB 245 right so the
 
06:03:41.150 --> 06:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
public filed their grievance there was
 
06:03:43.430 --> 06:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
no fee at the time at that time there
 
06:03:46.190 --> 06:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
was no SEC administrator so the full
 
06:03:49.010 --> 06:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
committee came together to hear it now
 
06:03:52.610 --> 06:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
with the passing of SB 245 there was a
 
06:03:55.788 --> 06:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
concern with Antrim wind and the option
 
06:03:58.010 --> 06:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
was to pay the ten thousand five hundred
 
06:04:01.430 --> 06:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
or the 3 000 and because of the
 
06:04:05.270 --> 06:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
limitations on finances there were a
 
06:04:07.310 --> 06:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
couple of residents within Antrim win
 
06:04:08.868 --> 06:04:08.878 align:start position:0%
that decided to go forward with the
 
06:04:11.208 --> 06:04:11.218 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling but only could afford
 
06:04:13.010 --> 06:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
to spend the three thousand dollars so
 
06:04:14.750 --> 06:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
they got a subcommittee hearing out of
 
06:04:14.760 --> 06:04:15.530 align:start position:0%
they got a subcommittee hearing out of
that

06:04:15.530 --> 06:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:04:19.190 --> 06:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
so that raises a good point prior to SB
 
06:04:22.010 --> 06:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
2485 Not only was there not a fee but
 
06:04:25.030 --> 06:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
they had a full committee now there's a
 
06:04:28.070 --> 06:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
exorbitant fee even to just get a small
 
06:04:31.310 --> 06:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of members
 
06:04:34.250 --> 06:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
so you needed
 
06:04:37.970 --> 06:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Pitts yes I I I I
 
06:04:41.208 --> 06:04:41.218 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I'm really bewildered about
 
06:04:44.810 --> 06:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
this so and what I heard you say or with
 
06:04:47.330 --> 06:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
my brain interpreted please correct me
 
06:04:49.730 --> 06:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
because I want to get this straight that
 
06:04:52.368 --> 06:04:52.378 align:start position:0%
you could buy a whole committee for Den
 
06:04:54.830 --> 06:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
Phi but you could take a subcommittee
 
06:04:57.350 --> 06:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
for three correct
 
06:04:59.628 --> 06:04:59.638 align:start position:0%
and that's that is a correct
 
06:05:02.090 --> 06:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
interpretation on my part that's the way
 
06:05:04.510 --> 06:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
that currently works okay thank you
 
06:05:07.788 --> 06:05:07.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question thank you
 
06:05:12.170 --> 06:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
okay uh we have two more
 
06:05:16.070 --> 06:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
no just one more hand raised so uh I
 
06:05:19.010 --> 06:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
recognize representative samsich for a
 
06:05:19.020 --> 06:05:20.390 align:start position:0%
recognize representative samsich for a
question

06:05:20.390 --> 06:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:05:22.730 --> 06:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Miss
 
06:05:26.150 --> 06:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
Lerner to thank my question uh I'd like
 
06:05:27.650 --> 06:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
to ask you do you think that this
 
06:05:30.948 --> 06:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
current bill would be improved upon if
 
06:05:35.150 --> 06:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
we I just charge the 250 dollars to
 
06:05:37.190 --> 06:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
entities that are not corporate or
 
06:05:40.070 --> 06:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
business interests I do I agree with
 
06:05:41.390 --> 06:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
that change
 
06:05:43.670 --> 06:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
yes I also believe the other component
 
06:05:46.330 --> 06:05:46.340 align:start position:0%
of the bill which clarifies the
 
06:05:48.770 --> 06:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
authority of the SEC administrator
 
06:05:50.510 --> 06:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
versus the committee is also very
 
06:05:50.520 --> 06:05:51.530 align:start position:0%
versus the committee is also very
important

06:05:51.530 --> 06:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
important
 
06:05:55.070 --> 06:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you thank you
 
06:05:57.948 --> 06:05:57.958 align:start position:0%
I've seen no more hands raised I think
 
06:06:01.730 --> 06:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
you um Ms Lerner for your testimony we
 
06:06:03.410 --> 06:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
have two more people who would like to
 
06:06:04.970 --> 06:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
speak and because we're running it
 
06:06:07.850 --> 06:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
against a time constraint I'm going to
 
06:06:09.948 --> 06:06:09.958 align:start position:0%
restrict each of the next two speakers
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
to two minutes each the first of those
 
06:06:18.650 --> 06:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:21.948 --> 06:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:30.230 --> 06:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:32.650 --> 06:06:32.660 align:start position:0%

Ms burrick you have the Berwick you have
 
06:06:48.650 --> 06:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
the floor for two minutes she's a member
 
06:06:51.288 --> 06:06:51.298 align:start position:0%
of the public representing herself
 
06:06:54.110 --> 06:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
and she submitted written testimony so
 
06:06:56.448 --> 06:06:56.458 align:start position:0%

06:07:00.650 --> 06:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
06:07:02.448 --> 06:07:02.458 align:start position:0%
um so I am a butter my husband and I are
 
06:07:05.390 --> 06:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
a Butters um and um
 
06:07:07.788 --> 06:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
I just feel like with three thousand
 
06:07:10.190 --> 06:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
dollars or ten thousand five thousand I
 
06:07:13.128 --> 06:07:13.138 align:start position:0%
mean there is no point we would like we
 
06:07:15.650 --> 06:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
filed a complaint back in January about
 
06:07:17.690 --> 06:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
a sound
 
06:07:21.650 --> 06:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
um exceedance of decibels I recorded it
 
06:07:23.570 --> 06:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
on my phone it had a graph and
 
06:07:25.490 --> 06:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
everything I didn't know what to do
 
06:07:28.970 --> 06:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
because it was you know I sent it to I
 
06:07:33.110 --> 06:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
think our um selectman and he and to
 
06:07:36.350 --> 06:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
Antrim win enter win basically said are
 
06:07:38.750 --> 06:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
we required four times a year to monitor
 
06:07:40.670 --> 06:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
the sound and that's basically what they
 
06:07:42.350 --> 06:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
were going to do
 
06:07:43.610 --> 06:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
06:07:44.868 --> 06:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
um okay I got to make it quick because
 
06:07:47.150 --> 06:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
in only two minutes but basically if I
 
06:07:50.390 --> 06:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
have if we if we want to
 
06:07:52.430 --> 06:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
the long story with that January thing
 
06:07:54.350 --> 06:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
is nothing has ever been done yet
 
06:07:57.048 --> 06:07:57.058 align:start position:0%
nothing when they did come and do this
 
06:08:00.048 --> 06:08:00.058 align:start position:0%
sound study in the spring they were
 
06:08:02.448 --> 06:08:02.458 align:start position:0%
there for I think nine ten days and they
 
06:08:05.150 --> 06:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
got nine hours of usable
 
06:08:07.128 --> 06:08:07.138 align:start position:0%
um sound dater the rest of it they
 
06:08:10.190 --> 06:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
considered unusable so one place that
 
06:08:11.948 --> 06:08:11.958 align:start position:0%
they were there for eight days they had
 
06:08:16.430 --> 06:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
one hour of usable sound data if and and
 
06:08:19.310 --> 06:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
we just feel like you know we want to
 
06:08:21.230 --> 06:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
question that they're not following the
 
06:08:23.990 --> 06:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
laws that were written by the SEC we got
 
06:08:26.690 --> 06:08:26.700 align:start position:0%
in sound data and we never said they
 
06:08:28.250 --> 06:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
could not come to our property we said
 
06:08:29.868 --> 06:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
they could we want to make sure that
 
06:08:31.610 --> 06:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
they're following the laws that are
 
06:08:33.288 --> 06:08:33.298 align:start position:0%
written before they're allowed to come
 
06:08:36.650 --> 06:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
back after that that Springtime one
 
06:08:39.230 --> 06:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
um but we I we can't afford three
 
06:08:41.090 --> 06:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that's just it you know
 
06:08:44.868 --> 06:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
we have we just basically feel like it
 
06:08:46.310 --> 06:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter anymore we don't matter
 
06:08:48.230 --> 06:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
we're not important we're not big
 
06:08:51.288 --> 06:08:51.298 align:start position:0%
business and we have no voice so if you
 
06:08:53.868 --> 06:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
if we have to pay three thousand dollars
 
06:08:55.850 --> 06:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
to have three people hear our case or
 
06:08:58.490 --> 06:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
ten thousand five hundred dollars
 
06:09:01.430 --> 06:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
we just can't we just there's no way we
 
06:09:04.010 --> 06:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
can it's not something within the means
 
06:09:05.628 --> 06:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
of most normal people
 
06:09:08.090 --> 06:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
and I just feel like um
 
06:09:11.208 --> 06:09:11.218 align:start position:0%
the SEC is supposed to be somewhat of a
 
06:09:13.430 --> 06:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
intermediary between the public and the
 
06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
big business and that they're supposed
 
06:09:17.628 --> 06:09:17.638 align:start position:0%
to be there to help represent and make
 
06:09:19.850 --> 06:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
sure that the big business doesn't just
 
06:09:23.150 --> 06:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
run over the little people and if this
 
06:09:26.030 --> 06:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill passes it will help a lot
 
06:09:29.570 --> 06:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:31.128 --> 06:09:31.138 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
06:09:32.750 --> 06:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
06:09:35.330 --> 06:09:35.340 align:start position:0%

06:09:40.440 --> 06:09:42.110 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

06:09:42.110 --> 06:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:09:48.770 --> 06:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:54.170 --> 06:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:56.090 --> 06:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
Michael Harrington you recognize for a
 
06:09:56.100 --> 06:09:57.110 align:start position:0%
Michael Harrington you recognize for a
question

06:09:57.110 --> 06:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:10:00.230 --> 06:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes I just want to say Barbara uh I
 
06:10:02.090 --> 06:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
was on the antrum site evaluation
 
06:10:03.890 --> 06:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
committee and I was responsible putting
 
06:10:05.868 --> 06:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of those sound issues in in the
 
06:10:07.910 --> 06:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
testing and I'm really sorry to hear
 
06:10:09.708 --> 06:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
that's not working I was supposed to and
 
06:10:11.390 --> 06:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
I understand your frustrations and
 
06:10:13.368 --> 06:10:13.378 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can change something so you
 
06:10:15.288 --> 06:10:15.298 align:start position:0%
have some options rather than just to
 
06:10:16.610 --> 06:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
that you're going to spend a lot of
 
06:10:18.530 --> 06:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
money or just listen to stuff that you
 
06:10:21.230 --> 06:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to hear I I really I really
 
06:10:24.110 --> 06:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that um I you know
 
06:10:26.930 --> 06:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
just all we really want is that the law
 
06:10:28.430 --> 06:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
is being followed that's all we really
 
06:10:31.548 --> 06:10:31.558 align:start position:0%
want but it does get to feeling like we
 
06:10:34.368 --> 06:10:34.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:37.368 --> 06:10:37.378 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Jackie Kelly
 
06:10:42.948 --> 06:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:46.990 --> 06:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:51.830 --> 06:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
Jackie I'm I'm bad Miss Berwick just a
 
06:10:55.190 --> 06:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
yes or a no do you have did you have or
 
06:11:00.288 --> 06:11:00.298 align:start position:0%
do you have access to that sound data
 
06:11:04.548 --> 06:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
is that data that was collected in this
 
06:11:04.558 --> 06:11:05.930 align:start position:0%
is that data that was collected in this
spring

06:11:05.930 --> 06:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
spring
 
06:11:08.330 --> 06:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
right to show whether they're within the
 
06:11:10.610 --> 06:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
levels that they're supposed to be do
 
06:11:13.030 --> 06:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
you have access to that
 
06:11:17.690 --> 06:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
data I probably do it's probably on the
 
06:11:19.788 --> 06:11:19.798 align:start position:0%
SEC website
 
06:11:22.490 --> 06:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
we normally have access to everything
 
06:11:24.650 --> 06:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
that's on the SEC website like they did
 
06:11:26.990 --> 06:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
just have a meeting with did not inform
 
06:11:30.288 --> 06:11:30.298 align:start position:0%
us about but usually everything
 
06:11:33.110 --> 06:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
um is is available through the SEC
 
06:11:33.120 --> 06:11:35.628 align:start position:0%
um is is available through the SEC
website

06:11:35.628 --> 06:11:35.638 align:start position:0%
website
 
06:11:42.410 --> 06:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:47.030 --> 06:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
so hey thank you for that uh answer just
 
06:11:49.070 --> 06:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
to clarify for you representative Kelly
 
06:11:51.708 --> 06:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
Fitz there is a serious question about
 
06:11:53.750 --> 06:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
whether the methodology used to gather
 
06:11:57.590 --> 06:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
that data correct Oh you mean the
 
06:12:00.350 --> 06:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
methodology I don't think I do have
 
06:12:03.590 --> 06:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
access to that no I have access to what
 
06:12:06.650 --> 06:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
they reported but uh we actually asked
 
06:12:09.948 --> 06:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
when they were going to do a sound study
 
06:12:12.590 --> 06:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
that you know if the one of the people
 
06:12:16.128 --> 06:12:16.138 align:start position:0%
that was a specialist with a sound could
 
06:12:17.930 --> 06:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
um just meet with the person that was
 
06:12:19.730 --> 06:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
going to do it we're going to have a
 
06:12:21.590 --> 06:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
phone meeting and everything this was
 
06:12:23.990 --> 06:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
through Pam Monroe and she was fine with
 
06:12:26.330 --> 06:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
it and she was setting it up and then
 
06:12:29.150 --> 06:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
suddenly he's gone it didn't happen and
 
06:12:30.890 --> 06:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I know I'm going over time but
 
06:12:32.390 --> 06:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
it didn't happen and we never did find
 
06:12:34.970 --> 06:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
out why and now we're talking about like
 
06:12:37.310 --> 06:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
having to pay a lot of money to get
 
06:12:38.990 --> 06:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
experts involved and this was going to
 
06:12:41.448 --> 06:12:41.458 align:start position:0%
be absolutely no cost to anybody just to
 
06:12:43.490 --> 06:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
have this phone conversation
 
06:12:45.770 --> 06:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know what happened thank you
 
06:13:03.128 --> 06:13:03.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:07.788 --> 06:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:10.970 --> 06:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:12.770 --> 06:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
the teachers and the kids in my class
 
06:13:16.090 --> 06:13:16.100 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time out so okay
 
06:13:19.670 --> 06:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you bye-bye
 
06:13:22.670 --> 06:13:22.680 align:start position:0%

06:13:30.890 --> 06:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
uh okay so thank you Ms Berwick we
 
06:13:32.810 --> 06:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony
 
06:13:34.670 --> 06:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
so we have no more hands raised we have
 
06:13:38.030 --> 06:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
no more uh folks who want to testify so
 
06:13:39.650 --> 06:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
I'm going to declare that this public
 
06:13:42.410 --> 06:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
hearing will be over as soon as I read
 
06:13:42.420 --> 06:13:44.448 align:start position:0%
hearing will be over as soon as I read
uh

06:13:44.448 --> 06:13:44.458 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:13:47.030 --> 06:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
blue sheet
 
06:13:49.190 --> 06:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the blue blue sheep for
 
06:13:52.368 --> 06:13:52.378 align:start position:0%
this bill is huge we've got 22 people in
 
06:13:55.310 --> 06:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
support of the bill 17 people who oppose
 
06:13:58.910 --> 06:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:01.548 --> 06:14:01.558 align:start position:0%
reading all the names would
 
06:14:03.590 --> 06:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
substantially lengthen this public
 
06:14:08.090 --> 06:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
hearing so I'm going to defer that this
 
06:14:10.430 --> 06:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
information is available to anybody who
 
06:14:12.410 --> 06:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
wants to look at it so
 
06:14:15.650 --> 06:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
feel free to Avail yourself of that at
 
06:14:20.570 --> 06:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:30.490 --> 06:14:30.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:33.948 --> 06:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
leadership or the elected officials
 
06:14:36.890 --> 06:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
just gives us a short list
 
06:14:39.948 --> 06:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
yes that's probably a conventional
 
06:14:44.990 --> 06:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:47.628 --> 06:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
Senator Bob Guida
 
06:14:50.208 --> 06:14:50.218 align:start position:0%
supported the bill Senator Ruth Ward
 
06:14:52.970 --> 06:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
supported the bill
 
06:14:52.980 --> 06:14:58.670 align:start position:0%
supported the bill
um

06:14:58.670 --> 06:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:03.288 --> 06:15:03.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:05.208 --> 06:15:05.218 align:start position:0%
so those were the
 
06:15:07.610 --> 06:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
significant elected officials who
 
06:15:08.750 --> 06:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
supported the bill
 
06:15:11.150 --> 06:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
so with that now we'll close the public
 
06:15:15.948 --> 06:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 624.
 
06:15:19.788 --> 06:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
and we will reopen the book hearing on
 
06:15:21.350 --> 06:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:15:24.170 --> 06:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
6 14.
 
06:15:26.090 --> 06:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
since I am the prime sponsor of that
 
06:15:29.030 --> 06:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
bill I will now introduce it to the
 
06:15:29.040 --> 06:15:31.970 align:start position:0%
bill I will now introduce it to the
committee

06:15:31.970 --> 06:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:34.670 --> 06:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
during this past election campaign the
 
06:15:37.730 --> 06:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
2020 election campaign
 
06:15:39.770 --> 06:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
as I went around my district I had a lot
 
06:15:43.730 --> 06:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
of talk for people about lowering
 
06:15:45.770 --> 06:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a perennial question but
 
06:15:48.410 --> 06:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
I would always respond to them by saying
 
06:15:48.420 --> 06:15:50.270 align:start position:0%
I would always respond to them by saying
well

06:15:50.270 --> 06:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:15:52.730 --> 06:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
your local property taxes are based more
 
06:15:54.890 --> 06:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
on your your Municipal and school budget
 
06:15:57.708 --> 06:15:57.718 align:start position:0%
than anything else and so you need to
 
06:16:00.310 --> 06:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
you need to deal with that by
 
06:16:03.048 --> 06:16:03.058 align:start position:0%
participating in the local budgeting
 
06:16:04.788 --> 06:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
process but I would still get a lot of
 
06:16:07.368 --> 06:16:07.378 align:start position:0%
people saying well can't the state
 
06:16:09.830 --> 06:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
provide more relief for
 
06:16:11.930 --> 06:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
06:16:14.150 --> 06:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:16:16.510 --> 06:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
so I thought about that a little bit and
 
06:16:20.570 --> 06:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
I decided to submit House Bill 614 unit
 
06:16:23.390 --> 06:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
which is a bill that exempts the state
 
06:16:25.368 --> 06:16:25.378 align:start position:0%
and its political subdivision this
 
06:16:28.670 --> 06:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
meaning municipalities towns cities
 
06:16:32.090 --> 06:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
school districts counties from paying
 
06:16:35.150 --> 06:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard
 
06:16:40.128 --> 06:16:40.138 align:start position:0%
fees that are part of the electric bill
 
06:16:41.690 --> 06:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
and part of the reason for doing that is
 
06:16:44.868 --> 06:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
because every citizen of every town
 
06:16:47.448 --> 06:16:47.458 align:start position:0%
pays for the RPS on their own personal
 
06:16:49.190 --> 06:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
electric bill
 
06:16:50.510 --> 06:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
but then when they go to pay their
 
06:16:52.190 --> 06:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
property taxes they essentially pay for
 
06:16:55.010 --> 06:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
it again when they pay for their
 
06:16:57.170 --> 06:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
municipal or School District or or
 
06:16:59.930 --> 06:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
County tax bill
 
06:17:02.030 --> 06:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
so that seemed like double jeopardy to
 
06:17:04.810 --> 06:17:04.820 align:start position:0%
me so I decided to submit this bill to
 
06:17:08.270 --> 06:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
allow cities towns and other political
 
06:17:10.850 --> 06:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
subdivisions to lower property taxes by
 
06:17:13.670 --> 06:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
not having to pay the renewable
 
06:17:15.530 --> 06:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
06:17:17.410 --> 06:17:17.420 align:start position:0%
fees that are part of the electric
 
06:17:20.990 --> 06:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
electric bill that every
 
06:17:22.850 --> 06:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
City Town
 
06:17:27.410 --> 06:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:30.890 --> 06:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
and these fees can be considerable
 
06:17:33.350 --> 06:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
according to the puc the state of New
 
06:17:33.360 --> 06:17:35.270 align:start position:0%
according to the puc the state of New
Hampshire

06:17:35.270 --> 06:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:17:38.690 --> 06:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
actually bought over 105 million
 
06:17:42.350 --> 06:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours of electricity in 2020.
 
06:17:47.170 --> 06:17:47.180 align:start position:0%
and based on the reconciled RPS rate
 
06:17:52.368 --> 06:17:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:55.730 --> 06:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
the reconciled rate for 2019 that would
 
06:17:58.430 --> 06:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
mean that the state spent over five
 
06:18:00.110 --> 06:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars almost five
 
06:18:02.208 --> 06:18:02.218 align:start position:0%
hundred and ten thousand dollars on the
 
06:18:04.910 --> 06:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
RPS in 2020.
 
06:18:08.208 --> 06:18:08.218 align:start position:0%
just as an aside it spent over seven
 
06:18:09.530 --> 06:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars on the
 
06:18:12.288 --> 06:18:12.298 align:start position:0%
assistant benefits chart
 
06:18:14.330 --> 06:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
I even looked at cities like Manchester
 
06:18:17.448 --> 06:18:17.458 align:start position:0%
and Nashua and determined that they
 
06:18:20.150 --> 06:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
spend tens of thousands of dollars to
 
06:18:21.948 --> 06:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
satisfy uh
 
06:18:23.868 --> 06:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
the RPS portion of their electricity
 
06:18:26.390 --> 06:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
bill and even my little town of Epping
 
06:18:28.730 --> 06:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
spends a couple of thousand dollars a
 
06:18:30.890 --> 06:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
year to satisfy the
 
06:18:34.730 --> 06:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
RPS as part of their electric bill
 
06:18:37.610 --> 06:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
so by exempting those
 
06:18:40.070 --> 06:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
fees those
 
06:18:44.030 --> 06:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
portions of the electricity bill from
 
06:18:46.490 --> 06:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
all these Municipal and other government
 
06:18:46.500 --> 06:18:48.288 align:start position:0%
all these Municipal and other government
entities

06:18:48.288 --> 06:18:48.298 align:start position:0%
entities
 
06:18:51.350 --> 06:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
we can lower property tax rates and save
 
06:18:53.090 --> 06:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
people money
 
06:18:54.410 --> 06:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
in the case of the State of New
 
06:18:55.850 --> 06:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that half a million dollars
 
06:18:58.208 --> 06:18:58.218 align:start position:0%
that we would save could be used for
 
06:19:00.650 --> 06:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
Education funding or Health and Human
 
06:19:05.330 --> 06:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
Services or any of uh a dozen or more
 
06:19:06.830 --> 06:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
other things that you can think of in
 
06:19:10.490 --> 06:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:13.970 --> 06:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
so the reason I submitted this bill was
 
06:19:18.590 --> 06:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
to provide that relief and the way the
 
06:19:22.548 --> 06:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
bill is worded and I have a or I will be
 
06:19:26.690 --> 06:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:28.910 --> 06:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment number
 
06:19:30.830 --> 06:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
I should give to you I sent it all to
 
06:19:33.830 --> 06:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
you to your legislative email yesterday
 
06:19:36.948 --> 06:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
last evening the amendment to the bill
 
06:19:36.958 --> 06:19:38.948 align:start position:0%
last evening the amendment to the bill
is

06:19:38.948 --> 06:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:19:42.470 --> 06:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
2021-0156h and it just clarifies some of
 
06:19:44.390 --> 06:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
the language the original bill
 
06:19:46.930 --> 06:19:46.940 align:start position:0%
which was written by OLS
 
06:19:49.730 --> 06:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
made a good stab at trying to do what I
 
06:19:52.010 --> 06:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to do but it didn't actually work
 
06:19:55.970 --> 06:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
out and in conjunction with the some
 
06:19:58.070 --> 06:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
folks from the Public Utilities
 
06:20:01.310 --> 06:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
Commission I came up with some or we
 
06:20:03.230 --> 06:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
came up with some better language that
 
06:20:06.650 --> 06:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
implements the bill as I wanted it to be
 
06:20:06.660 --> 06:20:08.090 align:start position:0%
implements the bill as I wanted it to be
implemented

06:20:08.090 --> 06:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
06:20:10.190 --> 06:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
and section B in particular
 
06:20:12.230 --> 06:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
which says providers of electricity
 
06:20:14.330 --> 06:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
shall not be subject to compliance under
 
06:20:17.810 --> 06:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
RSA 362 F3 for electricity sales that
 
06:20:20.510 --> 06:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
have been Exempted Exempted pursuant to
 
06:20:23.948 --> 06:20:23.958 align:start position:0%
subparagraph a specifically
 
06:20:26.150 --> 06:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
provides that there will be no cost
 
06:20:28.310 --> 06:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
shifting uh
 
06:20:33.288 --> 06:20:33.298 align:start position:0%
as a result of this bill so the RPS
 
06:20:36.048 --> 06:20:36.058 align:start position:0%
charges that would have been levied on
 
06:20:37.670 --> 06:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
cities and towns and other political
 
06:20:37.680 --> 06:20:39.070 align:start position:0%
cities and towns and other political
subdivisions

06:20:39.070 --> 06:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
06:20:41.930 --> 06:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
but are not but are Exempted it will not
 
06:20:44.810 --> 06:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
be shifted to other people to pay they
 
06:20:49.430 --> 06:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
will instead not even be required to be
 
06:20:49.440 --> 06:20:50.930 align:start position:0%
will instead not even be required to be
paid

06:20:50.930 --> 06:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
paid
 
06:20:53.170 --> 06:20:53.180 align:start position:0%
I also added some language in the
 
06:20:55.128 --> 06:20:55.138 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
06:20:55.138 --> 06:20:56.690 align:start position:0%
amendment to
uh

06:20:56.690 --> 06:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:21:02.390 --> 06:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:05.628 --> 06:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
contracts that the state or political
 
06:21:09.110 --> 06:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
subdivisions might negotiate with
 
06:21:11.150 --> 06:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
competitive electricity suppliers as it
 
06:21:12.708 --> 06:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
turns out the state gets almost all of
 
06:21:14.570 --> 06:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
its electricity from competitive
 
06:21:16.430 --> 06:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers
 
06:21:18.650 --> 06:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
and those suppliers are not regulated by
 
06:21:20.270 --> 06:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
06:21:23.208 --> 06:21:23.218 align:start position:0%
so I added language to the bill that
 
06:21:26.628 --> 06:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
requires those competitive suppliers to
 
06:21:29.390 --> 06:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
negotiate contracts with any political
 
06:21:29.400 --> 06:21:30.708 align:start position:0%
negotiate contracts with any political
subdivision

06:21:30.708 --> 06:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
06:21:33.288 --> 06:21:33.298 align:start position:0%
that exclude the cost of compliance with
 
06:21:36.770 --> 06:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard
 
06:21:38.690 --> 06:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
and also to report yearly to the
 
06:21:42.230 --> 06:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
commission on all of those contracts and
 
06:21:43.610 --> 06:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
finally there's a provision in the bill
 
06:21:46.850 --> 06:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
that if any particular
 
06:21:48.890 --> 06:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
political subdivision like a city or a
 
06:21:51.410 --> 06:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
town wanted to continue paying the RPS
 
06:21:55.368 --> 06:21:55.378 align:start position:0%
they could do so with a majority vote
 
06:21:58.730 --> 06:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
of the governing body of that political
 
06:21:58.740 --> 06:22:01.128 align:start position:0%
of the governing body of that political
subdivision

06:22:01.128 --> 06:22:01.138 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
06:22:03.708 --> 06:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
so that's the essence of the vote of the
 
06:22:06.110 --> 06:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
bill rather it's a it's a way to save
 
06:22:08.090 --> 06:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
some money
 
06:22:14.090 --> 06:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:17.390 --> 06:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard of maybe a
 
06:22:19.730 --> 06:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
few million dollars a year
 
06:22:21.948 --> 06:22:21.958 align:start position:0%
but it's not a huge amount of money
 
06:22:25.670 --> 06:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
but that money will be
 
06:22:28.128 --> 06:22:28.138 align:start position:0%
directly applicable to property tax
 
06:22:29.930 --> 06:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
relief should the cities and towns
 
06:22:32.570 --> 06:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
choose to use it that way so I'd be
 
06:22:34.368 --> 06:22:34.378 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions about the
 
06:22:38.090 --> 06:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
bill and uh thank you for
 
06:22:40.610 --> 06:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
hearing me up
 
06:22:44.990 --> 06:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay so the first person I see is
 
06:22:48.730 --> 06:22:48.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:53.750 --> 06:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:56.628 --> 06:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:58.970 --> 06:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
does would this bill
 
06:23:01.490 --> 06:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
was enacted
 
06:23:04.788 --> 06:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
um you know let it have a
 
06:23:07.010 --> 06:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
a more direct
 
06:23:11.350 --> 06:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:13.510 --> 06:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
AQA a a
 
06:23:16.430 --> 06:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
photography town city whatever whatever
 
06:23:19.010 --> 06:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
a more direct effect on the people that
 
06:23:21.170 --> 06:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
live there on their direct
 
06:23:27.288 --> 06:23:27.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:31.788 --> 06:23:31.798 align:start position:0%
in the future maybe possibly having a
 
06:23:33.650 --> 06:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
lower electric bill where the money
 
06:23:36.170 --> 06:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
could be could be used to like over
 
06:23:39.288 --> 06:23:39.298 align:start position:0%
to have proficiency of carpet efficiency
 
06:23:45.410 --> 06:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:46.670 --> 06:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
06:23:48.288 --> 06:23:48.298 align:start position:0%
well this bill will lower the
 
06:23:51.650 --> 06:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
electricity bills of all cities towns
 
06:23:53.628 --> 06:23:53.638 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
06:23:55.610 --> 06:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
the County government and the state
 
06:23:55.620 --> 06:23:56.990 align:start position:0%
the County government and the state
government

06:23:56.990 --> 06:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:23:59.990 --> 06:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
how the governing body of those
 
06:24:01.610 --> 06:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
individual political subdivisions
 
06:24:04.430 --> 06:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
decides to use those savings is up to
 
06:24:04.440 --> 06:24:05.510 align:start position:0%
decides to use those savings is up to
them

06:24:05.510 --> 06:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:24:05.520 --> 06:24:07.670 align:start position:0%
them
so

06:24:07.670 --> 06:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:24:09.470 --> 06:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
property tax relief is one of the
 
06:24:11.990 --> 06:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
possibilities other possibilities so
 
06:24:13.368 --> 06:24:13.378 align:start position:0%
they could just spend that money on
 
06:24:15.530 --> 06:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
something else
 
06:24:18.530 --> 06:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:22.310 --> 06:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:26.090 --> 06:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:27.830 --> 06:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
06:24:30.288 --> 06:24:30.298 align:start position:0%
to lower property infections to keep it
 
06:24:33.770 --> 06:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
correctly as opposed to
 
06:24:36.948 --> 06:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
future delivery lowering electric bill
 
06:24:39.650 --> 06:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
into the future
 
06:24:42.890 --> 06:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:45.650 --> 06:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
okay next step is uh representative
 
06:24:47.930 --> 06:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
Michael Harrington
 
06:24:50.570 --> 06:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so if I
 
06:24:51.890 --> 06:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly what you're
 
06:24:54.708 --> 06:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
saying is that the cities and towns can
 
06:24:56.628 --> 06:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
make this decision for themselves so if
 
06:24:58.670 --> 06:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
they feel it's worth it to pay the extra
 
06:25:01.610 --> 06:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
money to support renewable energy then
 
06:25:03.770 --> 06:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
they can do that but if they think
 
06:25:06.350 --> 06:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
they'd rather save the money and use it
 
06:25:08.990 --> 06:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
on something else whether it's relief of
 
06:25:11.990 --> 06:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers or more money for the
 
06:25:13.610 --> 06:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
schools or whatever they have that
 
06:25:15.590 --> 06:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
option so in other words this is a bill
 
06:25:17.750 --> 06:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
about Freedom it sounds like to me
 
06:25:20.510 --> 06:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
freedom to make a decision on what you
 
06:25:22.730 --> 06:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
think is the best way to go forward with
 
06:25:26.030 --> 06:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
your electric purchases is that correct
 
06:25:28.490 --> 06:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
yes that is definitely correct and
 
06:25:31.610 --> 06:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
freedom is was on my mind when I drafted
 
06:25:34.070 --> 06:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
this bill absolutely
 
06:25:37.970 --> 06:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:37.980 --> 06:25:40.250 align:start position:0%
 
oh

06:25:40.250 --> 06:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:25:43.490 --> 06:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
no follow-up okay thank you sorry I I'm
 
06:25:45.110 --> 06:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
muted no follow-up
 
06:25:48.230 --> 06:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
oh okay no follow up thank you next up
 
06:25:52.128 --> 06:25:52.138 align:start position:0%
is representative Ken Vincent
 
06:25:54.530 --> 06:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm really looking
 
06:25:56.150 --> 06:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
for a definition
 
06:25:59.330 --> 06:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
I keep hearing everybody talk about
 
06:26:01.490 --> 06:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
lowering taxes
 
06:26:04.070 --> 06:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
and I brought this up earlier
 
06:26:06.530 --> 06:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
when I think of lowering taxes I think
 
06:26:08.270 --> 06:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
of they're going to go from what they
 
06:26:11.510 --> 06:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
add down when you say lower taxes does
 
06:26:13.250 --> 06:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
your definition mean they're not going
 
06:26:15.948 --> 06:26:15.958 align:start position:0%
to go up as high because I never seen
 
06:26:20.448 --> 06:26:20.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:23.750 --> 06:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
what's that old uh cliche and nothing
 
06:26:26.170 --> 06:26:26.180 align:start position:0%
ever goes awakes
 
06:26:29.990 --> 06:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so you just mean you just mean
 
06:26:33.288 --> 06:26:33.298 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to go as high
 
06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're not going to increase as much as
 
06:26:37.910 --> 06:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
if they normally would at the freedom to
 
06:26:41.150 --> 06:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
choose how they want to uh
 
06:26:43.970 --> 06:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
deal with the savings they're going to
 
06:26:46.490 --> 06:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
realize on their electricity bills they
 
06:26:48.890 --> 06:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
can use it to lower property taxes which
 
06:26:51.170 --> 06:26:51.180 align:start position:0%
as you point out hardly ever happens or
 
06:26:54.650 --> 06:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
they can choose it to you know spend it
 
06:26:57.110 --> 06:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
on the fire department
 
06:26:59.590 --> 06:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
please some other
 
06:27:03.410 --> 06:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
town of government entity and I re I
 
06:27:05.208 --> 06:27:05.218 align:start position:0%
respect that
 
06:27:08.628 --> 06:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
but it the word is not increase them as
 
06:27:11.270 --> 06:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
higher as as high because we're not
 
06:27:12.410 --> 06:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
going to lower they're not going to send
 
06:27:15.530 --> 06:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
everybody a check for the the check the
 
06:27:18.230 --> 06:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
the taxes went backwards
 
06:27:20.150 --> 06:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
am I correct it's just not going to
 
06:27:23.990 --> 06:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
increase size so if you didn't have this
 
06:27:26.510 --> 06:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
and you say your taxes went up 50
 
06:27:29.690 --> 06:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
cents per thousand
 
06:27:33.288 --> 06:27:33.298 align:start position:0%
they might go up 49 cents per thousand
 
06:27:34.490 --> 06:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to find out
 
06:27:37.310 --> 06:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
because the word of the wording that
 
06:27:39.170 --> 06:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
people are using is lowering taxes
 
06:27:41.090 --> 06:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
they're just not going to go up as high
 
06:27:43.368 --> 06:27:43.378 align:start position:0%
am I right because I I have a hard time
 
06:27:46.910 --> 06:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:46.920 --> 06:27:48.548 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:27:48.548 --> 06:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:27:50.868 --> 06:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
06:27:53.868 --> 06:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
the freedom to choose whether they lower
 
06:27:56.090 --> 06:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
06:27:58.490 --> 06:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
that's what this is all about
 
06:28:01.930 --> 06:28:01.940 align:start position:0%
not going up as high thank you
 
06:28:05.390 --> 06:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
okay that's what it is
 
06:28:11.628 --> 06:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:14.990 --> 06:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so
 
06:28:19.490 --> 06:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh my concern about this bill is that in
 
06:28:22.730 --> 06:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
fact when we exempt the state and the
 
06:28:25.850 --> 06:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions from paying these
 
06:28:27.830 --> 06:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
um proportions for the renewable energy
 
06:28:31.250 --> 06:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh standards what we're really doing is
 
06:28:33.230 --> 06:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
we're reducing the amount of money
 
06:28:36.830 --> 06:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
available for Energy Efficiency and
 
06:28:39.288 --> 06:28:39.298 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects
 
06:28:39.298 --> 06:28:40.670 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects
and

06:28:40.670 --> 06:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:28:44.690 --> 06:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
yeah and the idea that somehow uh that
 
06:28:47.930 --> 06:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
will give people a break on their on the
 
06:28:49.970 --> 06:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
impacts of their taxes
 
06:28:52.190 --> 06:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's kind of wishful thinking because
 
06:28:54.350 --> 06:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
those very same entities even though
 
06:28:56.570 --> 06:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
they're not paying those fees
 
06:28:59.570 --> 06:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
into that fund are now coming in and
 
06:29:02.628 --> 06:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
saying we'd like to ask for funding for
 
06:29:05.570 --> 06:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
our renewable energy project in our town
 
06:29:08.510 --> 06:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know they I mean if you were to
 
06:29:11.150 --> 06:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
exclude them from those processes if
 
06:29:12.548 --> 06:29:12.558 align:start position:0%
they're not going to pay their own way
 
06:29:14.930 --> 06:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
why should they have the benefit of
 
06:29:16.788 --> 06:29:16.798 align:start position:0%
getting these projects in their own town
 
06:29:19.670 --> 06:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
and municipalities so instead of freedom
 
06:29:23.690 --> 06:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
I I called freeloading really because if
 
06:29:26.448 --> 06:29:26.458 align:start position:0%
we say if we if I in my town we decide
 
06:29:28.250 --> 06:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
we want to be good people we want to pay
 
06:29:30.470 --> 06:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
that because we support renewable energy
 
06:29:32.930 --> 06:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
projects and a neighboring Town says
 
06:29:34.368 --> 06:29:34.378 align:start position:0%
we're not going to pay that but we want
 
06:29:35.930 --> 06:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
to have the benefit of getting those
 
06:29:38.628 --> 06:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
projects in our town using the same
 
06:29:41.150 --> 06:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
funds that we didn't pay into I say
 
06:29:42.890 --> 06:29:42.900 align:start position:0%
that's freeloading
 
06:29:44.868 --> 06:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:29:47.628 --> 06:29:47.638 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samsich I would
 
06:29:49.490 --> 06:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
remind you that during public hearings
 
06:29:52.010 --> 06:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
we don't debate issues we ask questions
 
06:29:56.530 --> 06:29:56.540 align:start position:0%
to gather information next up is
 
06:30:02.208 --> 06:30:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:05.208 --> 06:30:05.218 align:start position:0%
um I actually have some testimony in
 
06:30:06.948 --> 06:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
front of me here year that I wanted to
 
06:30:08.930 --> 06:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
cite because I think that the
 
06:30:11.750 --> 06:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
information that's being presented is
 
06:30:13.250 --> 06:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
giving a very
 
06:30:15.410 --> 06:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
um sort of high level picture to people
 
06:30:17.208 --> 06:30:17.218 align:start position:0%
of what the implications of the bill are
 
06:30:20.090 --> 06:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
it's Freedom it's allowing people to
 
06:30:22.610 --> 06:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
lower their costs if they choose which
 
06:30:24.350 --> 06:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
of course we always will choose to lower
 
06:30:28.010 --> 06:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
our costs but there is kind of a flaw in
 
06:30:30.708 --> 06:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
the thinking in that the way that the
 
06:30:33.410 --> 06:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
RPS is structured it's a Rec system
 
06:30:35.208 --> 06:30:35.218 align:start position:0%
which we're not talking about which is
 
06:30:38.330 --> 06:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
another level of complexity and I'm not
 
06:30:39.948 --> 06:30:39.958 align:start position:0%
going to go into the details of the rec
 
06:30:41.448 --> 06:30:41.458 align:start position:0%
system because I really am not even
 
06:30:43.850 --> 06:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
qualified to do that but if someone
 
06:30:46.548 --> 06:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't have sufficient number of reps
 
06:30:49.970 --> 06:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
to meet their RPS they would then have
 
06:30:51.890 --> 06:30:51.900 align:start position:0%
to pay the ACP the alternative
 
06:30:55.010 --> 06:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
compliance payments and what this bill
 
06:30:58.368 --> 06:30:58.378 align:start position:0%
apparently uh you have a question
 
06:31:01.190 --> 06:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yes I'm going to
 
06:31:03.770 --> 06:31:03.780 align:start position:0%
ask you how you can square this hole
 
06:31:07.128 --> 06:31:07.138 align:start position:0%
because it appears if I can give you
 
06:31:08.690 --> 06:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
enough detail for people to understand
 
06:31:10.788 --> 06:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying
 
06:31:13.010 --> 06:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
um so the wrecks are the most cost
 
06:31:15.170 --> 06:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
effective way to comply with the RPS at
 
06:31:16.850 --> 06:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
this point and the alternative
 
06:31:20.810 --> 06:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
compliance compliance payments are uh
 
06:31:23.690 --> 06:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
the most expensive form of compliance
 
06:31:27.650 --> 06:31:27.660 align:start position:0%
so uh I guess in a class 4 wreck the the
 
06:31:30.830 --> 06:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
discount uh from ACP is about 30 if you
 
06:31:32.090 --> 06:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
go with a wreck
 
06:31:34.970 --> 06:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
so it's always better for rate payers
 
06:31:36.708 --> 06:31:36.718 align:start position:0%
when the RPS compliance is achieved
 
06:31:39.170 --> 06:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
through the Retro the rec purchase
 
06:31:42.770 --> 06:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
so if hb614 goes through and doesn't it
 
06:31:45.048 --> 06:31:45.058 align:start position:0%
doesn't address what happens if a
 
06:31:47.868 --> 06:31:47.878 align:start position:0%
provider's ACP payments are low or even
 
06:31:50.810 --> 06:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
zero so the bill could create a reverse
 
06:31:52.970 --> 06:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
incentive for providers that would
 
06:31:55.490 --> 06:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
increase their ACP payment their ACP
 
06:31:58.730 --> 06:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
payments which would then um be more
 
06:32:00.770 --> 06:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
costly for New Hampshire rate payers so
 
06:32:03.590 --> 06:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
my question is you're presenting the
 
06:32:05.628 --> 06:32:05.638 align:start position:0%
bill as one thing but you haven't
 
06:32:08.930 --> 06:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
answered this scenario whereby it would
 
06:32:10.610 --> 06:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
actually increase costs for people
 
06:32:12.948 --> 06:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
because the alternative compliance
 
06:32:14.868 --> 06:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
payments will be more expensive for the
 
06:32:18.230 --> 06:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
towns to support if they're a direct
 
06:32:20.810 --> 06:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
piece Falls away
 
06:32:22.310 --> 06:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I guess
 
06:32:23.690 --> 06:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
maybe you haven't had a chance to look
 
06:32:27.110 --> 06:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
at the amendment the amendment removes
 
06:32:29.628 --> 06:32:29.638 align:start position:0%
section about alternative compliance
 
06:32:31.910 --> 06:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
payments uh because it's no longer
 
06:32:34.128 --> 06:32:34.138 align:start position:0%
necessary to make sure that there's no
 
06:32:38.868 --> 06:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
cost shifting in the in the bill
 
06:32:41.390 --> 06:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
so the chair now recognizes
 
06:32:44.090 --> 06:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative brechner for a question
 
06:32:45.890 --> 06:32:45.900 align:start position:0%
good questions can you point to me where
 
06:32:49.850 --> 06:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:52.970 --> 06:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
into that language please yes section B
 
06:32:56.110 --> 06:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
of the amended version of the bill
 
06:32:59.990 --> 06:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
says that providers of electricity shall
 
06:33:02.990 --> 06:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
not be subject to compliance under RSA
 
06:33:06.350 --> 06:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
362 F3 for electricity sales that have
 
06:33:08.890 --> 06:33:08.900 align:start position:0%
been Exempted so basically
 
06:33:11.570 --> 06:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
the way the RPS works if you're a
 
06:33:13.970 --> 06:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
utility and you sell 10 million kilowatt
 
06:33:16.250 --> 06:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
hours or 10 million megawatt hours of
 
06:33:19.128 --> 06:33:19.138 align:start position:0%
electricity you're obligated
 
06:33:21.590 --> 06:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
to purchase a certain number of wrecks
 
06:33:24.110 --> 06:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
based on that load
 
06:33:24.120 --> 06:33:25.310 align:start position:0%
based on that load
if

06:33:25.310 --> 06:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:33:27.410 --> 06:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
some number of kilowatt hours are
 
06:33:29.510 --> 06:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
Exempted then they don't become that
 
06:33:31.548 --> 06:33:31.558 align:start position:0%
part of that load and so the utility
 
06:33:34.670 --> 06:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
buys wrecks based on what the adjusted
 
06:33:35.930 --> 06:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
load is
 
06:33:38.770 --> 06:33:38.780 align:start position:0%
so that's how that
 
06:33:41.510 --> 06:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
particular provision
 
06:33:43.610 --> 06:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's no cost shifting
 
06:33:50.628 --> 06:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:53.868 --> 06:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear that so it undermines the
 
06:33:55.970 --> 06:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
RPS program that we currently have in
 
06:33:55.980 --> 06:33:57.830 align:start position:0%
RPS program that we currently have in
statute

06:33:57.830 --> 06:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:34:00.850 --> 06:34:00.860 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say that it undermines it it
 
06:34:04.850 --> 06:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
simply gives cities and towns a way to
 
06:34:08.030 --> 06:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
save some money that's all it does
 
06:34:10.128 --> 06:34:10.138 align:start position:0%
representative brezhne did you have a
 
06:34:12.230 --> 06:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman if
 
06:34:14.090 --> 06:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
this bill passes and if towns choose to
 
06:34:16.368 --> 06:34:16.378 align:start position:0%
pass the savings to the taxpayers when
 
06:34:18.350 --> 06:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
could the taxpayers potentially see a
 
06:34:21.530 --> 06:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:24.530 --> 06:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
probably when a new town budget goes
 
06:34:26.810 --> 06:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
into effect
 
06:34:29.948 --> 06:34:29.958 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up no problem
 
06:34:29.958 --> 06:34:31.628 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up no problem
representative

06:34:31.628 --> 06:34:31.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:34:34.190 --> 06:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
closure you have a question
 
06:34:36.230 --> 06:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:34:40.010 --> 06:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
um for the talent Epping for example you
 
06:34:42.770 --> 06:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
used the thousand dollars they would
 
06:34:47.390 --> 06:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
spend on the rps's send in
 
06:34:51.430 --> 06:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
it would go to help efficiency
 
06:34:55.610 --> 06:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
and say it's in the grant for we use
 
06:35:00.230 --> 06:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
Elsewhere for 300 of them with the 450
 
06:35:02.390 --> 06:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
000 residents
 
06:35:06.110 --> 06:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
if the 1000 am I correct them
 
06:35:08.690 --> 06:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
no the renewable portfolio standard
 
06:35:12.230 --> 06:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
actually provides subsidies to vendors
 
06:35:15.010 --> 06:35:15.020 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy projects
 
06:35:15.020 --> 06:35:17.750 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy projects
[Music]

06:35:17.750 --> 06:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:35:20.270 --> 06:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
that dilution over the state now that
 
06:35:21.590 --> 06:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
one thousand dollars would stay in
 
06:35:25.128 --> 06:35:25.138 align:start position:0%
Epping if 50 of uh
 
06:35:30.548 --> 06:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
the vote wants to use it for renewable
 
06:35:33.288 --> 06:35:33.298 align:start position:0%
efficiency in the town
 
06:35:35.390 --> 06:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be a greater
 
06:35:37.850 --> 06:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
use of that money for the town their own
 
06:35:37.860 --> 06:35:39.288 align:start position:0%
use of that money for the town their own
money

06:35:39.288 --> 06:35:39.298 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:35:41.150 --> 06:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
well that's up to the town to decide
 
06:35:43.610 --> 06:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
right that the bill provides for a way
 
06:35:46.250 --> 06:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
that the town can make that choice
 
06:35:57.170 --> 06:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:01.788 --> 06:36:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:04.610 --> 06:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute yourself
 
06:36:06.770 --> 06:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask if
 
06:36:06.780 --> 06:36:07.730 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask if
um

06:36:07.730 --> 06:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:10.970 --> 06:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
if if the sponsor of the bill has the
 
06:36:13.368 --> 06:36:13.378 align:start position:0%
breakdown count by count
 
06:36:17.868 --> 06:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
of what each town would say because I
 
06:36:20.390 --> 06:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
when when I heard that the taxes would
 
06:36:22.850 --> 06:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
be lowered for a thousand dollars
 
06:36:26.930 --> 06:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
of savings that to me is like a drop in
 
06:36:29.448 --> 06:36:29.458 align:start position:0%
the bucket in Epic
 
06:36:29.458 --> 06:36:30.170 align:start position:0%
the bucket in Epic
um

06:36:30.170 --> 06:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:32.930 --> 06:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
and I shop in Epping quite a bit but I
 
06:36:35.390 --> 06:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to know do we have a
 
06:36:37.850 --> 06:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
breakdown and I'm disappointed
 
06:36:40.128 --> 06:36:40.138 align:start position:0%
that no members
 
06:36:43.610 --> 06:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
of the utilities or the puc or anybody
 
06:36:47.208 --> 06:36:47.218 align:start position:0%
is here to ask that question can we have
 
06:36:48.830 --> 06:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
a town by town
 
06:36:55.250 --> 06:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:58.610 --> 06:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
that would be relatively uh
 
06:37:01.010 --> 06:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
easy but time consuming to produce
 
06:37:03.708 --> 06:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
because you would have to go to all 234
 
06:37:06.110 --> 06:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
towns and ask how many kilowatt hours of
 
06:37:07.670 --> 06:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
electricity they purchased in the
 
06:37:08.930 --> 06:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
previous year
 
06:37:11.810 --> 06:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
and then use the
 
06:37:11.820 --> 06:37:14.510 align:start position:0%
and then use the
um

06:37:14.510 --> 06:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:18.948 --> 06:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
the rate the PSA rate the uh I mean RSA
 
06:37:18.958 --> 06:37:20.530 align:start position:0%
the rate the PSA rate the uh I mean RSA
rate

06:37:20.530 --> 06:37:20.540 align:start position:0%
rate
 
06:37:23.410 --> 06:37:23.420 align:start position:0%
RPS race
 
06:37:26.868 --> 06:37:26.878 align:start position:0%
for the utility in that town to com to
 
06:37:30.470 --> 06:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
compute uh what their Town's savings
 
06:37:32.750 --> 06:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
would be I didn't do that for all 234
 
06:37:35.150 --> 06:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
towns I did it for a couple of
 
06:37:38.330 --> 06:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
Representative towns just to provide
 
06:37:41.628 --> 06:37:41.638 align:start position:0%
some context and some numbers for for
 
06:37:45.230 --> 06:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
the committee it would be possible to do
 
06:37:47.628 --> 06:37:47.638 align:start position:0%
that work
 
06:37:50.448 --> 06:37:50.458 align:start position:0%
but I have chosen not to do so at this
 
06:37:50.458 --> 06:37:52.250 align:start position:0%
but I have chosen not to do so at this
time

06:37:52.250 --> 06:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:37:57.048 --> 06:37:57.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:58.970 --> 06:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead follow up the other
 
06:38:01.368 --> 06:38:01.378 align:start position:0%
question would be the state of New
 
06:38:05.390 --> 06:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire paid 510 000 for the RPS is
 
06:38:06.770 --> 06:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
that for
 
06:38:10.490 --> 06:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
All State properties and state-owned
 
06:38:10.500 --> 06:38:12.350 align:start position:0%
All State properties and state-owned
properties

06:38:12.350 --> 06:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
properties
 
06:38:15.948 --> 06:38:15.958 align:start position:0%
uh or is that for the entire state were
 
06:38:20.030 --> 06:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:21.650 --> 06:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
I thank you for that question that's
 
06:38:24.048 --> 06:38:24.058 align:start position:0%
that's actually an interesting uh
 
06:38:25.970 --> 06:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
question because the Public Utilities
 
06:38:25.980 --> 06:38:27.110 align:start position:0%
question because the Public Utilities
Commission

06:38:27.110 --> 06:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
06:38:29.208 --> 06:38:29.218 align:start position:0%
gave me the figure of a hundred and five
 
06:38:32.270 --> 06:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
thousand 105 million uh kilowatt hours
 
06:38:34.910 --> 06:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
that the state used but the state energy
 
06:38:37.070 --> 06:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
manager gave me a different number it
 
06:38:39.110 --> 06:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
was more like 80
 
06:38:42.350 --> 06:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
000 or 80 million kilowatt hours I use
 
06:38:44.208 --> 06:38:44.218 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission number
 
06:38:44.218 --> 06:38:45.730 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission number
because

06:38:45.730 --> 06:38:45.740 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:38:48.190 --> 06:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
I figured that they really ought to know
 
06:38:51.288 --> 06:38:51.298 align:start position:0%
but the state energy manager probably
 
06:38:53.448 --> 06:38:53.458 align:start position:0%
ought to know too so I'm not entirely
 
06:38:55.610 --> 06:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
certain how to record reconcile the
 
06:38:58.548 --> 06:38:58.558 align:start position:0%
difference between those two numbers
 
06:39:04.430 --> 06:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:16.090 --> 06:39:16.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:20.270 --> 06:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
I'm told that uh in response to the
 
06:39:21.770 --> 06:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
question you asked Jackie Kelly that's
 
06:39:24.350 --> 06:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh a minute ago that eversource is
 
06:39:27.350 --> 06:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
online and is willing and available to
 
06:39:31.670 --> 06:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
answer questions if anybody has one
 
06:39:34.070 --> 06:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
next step for a question is
 
06:39:38.930 --> 06:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
representative uh Jacqueline credition
 
06:39:42.288 --> 06:39:42.298 align:start position:0%
you chair I do have two questions so one
 
06:39:45.470 --> 06:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
just as a very practical matter after
 
06:39:48.770 --> 06:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
this amended Bill comes into effect
 
06:39:52.430 --> 06:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
with the immediate effect be for this
 
06:39:56.270 --> 06:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
number to disappear from the state and
 
06:39:58.850 --> 06:39:58.860 align:start position:0%
Municipal bills or exactly how would
 
06:39:58.860 --> 06:40:02.510 align:start position:0%
Municipal bills or exactly how would
that

06:40:02.510 --> 06:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:05.510 --> 06:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
am I making sense so so if this applies
 
06:40:08.090 --> 06:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
will will that line item still be on the
 
06:40:10.368 --> 06:40:10.378 align:start position:0%
bills will it disappear how will that
 
06:40:10.378 --> 06:40:12.170 align:start position:0%
bills will it disappear how will that
work

06:40:12.170 --> 06:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
work
 
06:40:14.708 --> 06:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
if I understand your question correctly
 
06:40:16.970 --> 06:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
you're asking
 
06:40:19.070 --> 06:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
how would the city or town know that
 
06:40:21.470 --> 06:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
they uh that their Bill had been reduced
 
06:40:23.990 --> 06:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
by the amount uh that they would have
 
06:40:29.570 --> 06:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:29.580 --> 06:40:33.650 align:start position:0%
 
dinner

06:40:33.650 --> 06:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:37.010 --> 06:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
basically this is an opt out bill but it
 
06:40:39.230 --> 06:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
provides a provision for the political
 
06:40:41.990 --> 06:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
subdivision to opt in with a majority
 
06:40:46.310 --> 06:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
vote of its governing body
 
06:40:48.470 --> 06:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
so the default will be for it to come
 
06:40:52.850 --> 06:40:52.860 align:start position:0%
off the bill and then yes so the RPS
 
06:40:55.430 --> 06:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
charges would just not appear on the
 
06:40:57.288 --> 06:40:57.298 align:start position:0%
bill they're just part of the the bill
 
06:40:58.970 --> 06:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
anyway you don't see them broken out
 
06:40:58.980 --> 06:41:00.410 align:start position:0%
anyway you don't see them broken out
separately

06:41:00.410 --> 06:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
separately
 
06:41:02.208 --> 06:41:02.218 align:start position:0%
so the bill would just be reduced by
 
06:41:03.890 --> 06:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
that amount
 
06:41:06.948 --> 06:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
thank you um and my second question if I
 
06:41:06.958 --> 06:41:12.470 align:start position:0%
thank you um and my second question if I
may

06:41:12.470 --> 06:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:15.708 --> 06:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
amount I guess that would be taken out
 
06:41:17.868 --> 06:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
of the renewable portfolio standard if
 
06:41:20.868 --> 06:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
no municipality is elected to keep going
 
06:41:24.048 --> 06:41:24.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:26.510 --> 06:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
without uh
 
06:41:29.628 --> 06:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
getting data from all 234 towns plus all
 
06:41:32.090 --> 06:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
the school districts and the counties in
 
06:41:35.330 --> 06:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
the state it would be hard to put an
 
06:41:38.990 --> 06:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
exact number on that but I would guess
 
06:41:41.208 --> 06:41:41.218 align:start position:0%
based on how much the state is paying
 
06:41:44.390 --> 06:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
for the RPS and the cities of Manchester
 
06:41:47.810 --> 06:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
and Nashua that the total for the entire
 
06:41:49.788 --> 06:41:49.798 align:start position:0%
state would probably be five million
 
06:41:53.330 --> 06:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:57.350 --> 06:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:00.650 --> 06:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:04.930 --> 06:42:04.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:07.788 --> 06:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman
 
06:42:07.798 --> 06:42:09.288 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman
uh

06:42:09.288 --> 06:42:09.298 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:42:11.208 --> 06:42:11.218 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we have not had the
 
06:42:13.490 --> 06:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity as in previous years during
 
06:42:16.250 --> 06:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
that orientation to be briefed on the
 
06:42:18.650 --> 06:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard or Reggie
 
06:42:22.190 --> 06:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
as a result many of the people who are
 
06:42:24.708 --> 06:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
going to be asked to vote on this bill
 
06:42:27.170 --> 06:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
have no background in what the public
 
06:42:29.030 --> 06:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
policy of the State of New Hampshire is
 
06:42:31.490 --> 06:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
with reference to these programs
 
06:42:34.430 --> 06:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the puc here and we
 
06:42:37.788 --> 06:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
don't have Des because many part
 
06:42:39.948 --> 06:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
available staff is being pushed to the
 
06:42:42.288 --> 06:42:42.298 align:start position:0%
pandemic and helping with cobit so they
 
06:42:44.930 --> 06:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
can't be here to cover every opportunity
 
06:42:47.930 --> 06:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
and it's much more cost effective to
 
06:42:50.390 --> 06:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
have a period of time where they present
 
06:42:53.330 --> 06:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
to us and explain to us and let us ask
 
06:42:55.070 --> 06:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
them the questions that would tell us
 
06:42:57.590 --> 06:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
why do we have these programs
 
06:42:59.810 --> 06:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
we are part of a regional grid that is
 
06:43:02.628 --> 06:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
moving to clean energy we are part of a
 
06:43:05.330 --> 06:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
national entity that is moving to clean
 
06:43:08.390 --> 06:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
energy investments in renewable energy
 
06:43:11.930 --> 06:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
are what are going to get us on the road
 
06:43:14.690 --> 06:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
to making we talked about oh gee grid
 
06:43:16.610 --> 06:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
Mod's taking five years why don't they
 
06:43:19.250 --> 06:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
get off the second get it done these are
 
06:43:21.770 --> 06:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
complex issues but there are also issues
 
06:43:24.770 --> 06:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
that take money we're investing in a New
 
06:43:26.628 --> 06:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business our renewable energy
 
06:43:29.570 --> 06:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
businesses are jobs these are companies
 
06:43:32.390 --> 06:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
in our state taking money away from the
 
06:43:35.090 --> 06:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund is gutting a
 
06:43:37.128 --> 06:43:37.138 align:start position:0%
program which is going to result in the
 
06:43:38.690 --> 06:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
larger transmission Regional
 
06:43:40.788 --> 06:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
transmission charges it's going to cost
 
06:43:43.070 --> 06:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
the rate payer more money it's bait and
 
06:43:45.288 --> 06:43:45.298 align:start position:0%
switch you're calling it lowering taxes
 
06:43:47.090 --> 06:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
and you're going to run for that on an
 
06:43:49.128 --> 06:43:49.138 align:start position:0%
election and you're doing no such thing
 
06:43:52.430 --> 06:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
and I think it's really
 
06:43:54.590 --> 06:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
not a good thing
 
06:43:56.750 --> 06:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry that wasn't phrased as a
 
06:43:58.548 --> 06:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
question because I just couldn't I just
 
06:44:00.708 --> 06:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
couldn't find a question oh here's the
 
06:44:03.650 --> 06:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
question why didn't we have the
 
06:44:03.660 --> 06:44:04.910 align:start position:0%
question why didn't we have the
briefings

06:44:04.910 --> 06:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
briefings
 
06:44:07.250 --> 06:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
that would enable us to make the
 
06:44:09.470 --> 06:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
decisions we need to make in a
 
06:44:13.850 --> 06:44:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:16.910 --> 06:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
we're having a public hearing that's
 
06:44:19.490 --> 06:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's the way we always make policy
 
06:44:21.650 --> 06:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
decisions we have public hearings we
 
06:44:24.590 --> 06:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
hear from all members of the public and
 
06:44:27.590 --> 06:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
from agency heads who choose to
 
06:44:30.470 --> 06:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
participate and then we make a decision
 
06:44:33.288 --> 06:44:33.298 align:start position:0%
I know of an agency here that asked to
 
06:44:35.330 --> 06:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
be able to make a presentation and was
 
06:44:36.830 --> 06:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
told that we were going to rely on
 
06:44:39.288 --> 06:44:39.298 align:start position:0%
written testimony because of the time
 
06:44:42.110 --> 06:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
constraints again and again we're we're
 
06:44:44.030 --> 06:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
being curtailed in our ability to
 
06:44:45.948 --> 06:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
function appropriately as legislators
 
06:44:48.890 --> 06:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
because of this emphasis on time
 
06:44:48.900 --> 06:44:52.010 align:start position:0%
because of this emphasis on time
constraints

06:44:52.010 --> 06:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:54.170 --> 06:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
well the time constraints are real
 
06:44:56.150 --> 06:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
and so we have to deal with them it's
 
06:44:58.610 --> 06:44:58.620 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate and we hope that those
 
06:45:00.650 --> 06:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
things that thing that situation will
 
06:45:03.470 --> 06:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
change at some point in the future but
 
06:45:05.510 --> 06:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with it now and so we
 
06:45:07.010 --> 06:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
will deal with it now
 
06:45:09.650 --> 06:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh and we'll deal with it as effectively
 
06:45:12.708 --> 06:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
as we can is it a perfect process no but
 
06:45:15.830 --> 06:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
we'll do the best job we can we'll do
 
06:45:18.170 --> 06:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
the job we've been elected to do
 
06:45:18.180 --> 06:45:19.610 align:start position:0%
the job we've been elected to do
and

06:45:19.610 --> 06:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:45:22.910 --> 06:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll accept the results that we
 
06:45:22.920 --> 06:45:24.110 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll accept the results that we
get

06:45:24.110 --> 06:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:45:26.570 --> 06:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
that's all I can tell you okay next up
 
06:45:28.490 --> 06:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:45:33.410 --> 06:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:35.750 --> 06:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:45:35.760 --> 06:45:36.410 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

06:45:36.410 --> 06:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:39.830 --> 06:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass we know that
 
06:45:42.470 --> 06:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
this would end up decreasing the Energy
 
06:45:46.448 --> 06:45:46.458 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund which of course is for
 
06:45:50.030 --> 06:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency work done throughout
 
06:45:53.510 --> 06:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
the state but it also pays the 90 cents
 
06:45:56.030 --> 06:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
I get back on my electric bill every
 
06:45:58.070 --> 06:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
month I'm wondering if you could tell me
 
06:46:00.350 --> 06:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
how much that 90 cents is going to be
 
06:46:00.360 --> 06:46:04.250 align:start position:0%
how much that 90 cents is going to be
reduced

06:46:04.250 --> 06:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:04.260 --> 06:46:05.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:46:05.090 --> 06:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:06.948 --> 06:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
this bill has nothing to do with Energy
 
06:46:06.958 --> 06:46:09.430 align:start position:0%
this bill has nothing to do with Energy
Efficiency

06:46:09.430 --> 06:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
Efficiency
 
06:46:12.770 --> 06:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard and
 
06:46:16.610 --> 06:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
um there's no 90 Cent figure that
 
06:46:19.850 --> 06:46:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:23.570 --> 06:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up follow-up question
 
06:46:28.310 --> 06:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
um the the money that goes I guess I
 
06:46:30.708 --> 06:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
must have misunderstood it but the
 
06:46:32.990 --> 06:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
amount of money that goes uh that's paid
 
06:46:36.410 --> 06:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
out uh to meet the RPS
 
06:46:39.890 --> 06:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh I thought that goes into the the
 
06:46:45.048 --> 06:46:45.058 align:start position:0%
funds for the uh Energy Efficiency fund
 
06:46:47.990 --> 06:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
am I incorrect there
 
06:46:50.510 --> 06:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
yes you are incorrect and and the
 
06:46:52.548 --> 06:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
original version of the bill did talk
 
06:46:52.558 --> 06:46:53.930 align:start position:0%
original version of the bill did talk
about

06:46:53.930 --> 06:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:46:56.750 --> 06:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
um the alternative compliance payments
 
06:46:59.208 --> 06:46:59.218 align:start position:0%
which go into the renewable energy fund
 
06:47:02.390 --> 06:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
but that language has been removed by
 
06:47:05.150 --> 06:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I will file
 
06:47:07.788 --> 06:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
um on the bill which I sent to your
 
06:47:11.150 --> 06:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
legislative email last evening
 
06:47:13.610 --> 06:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question next up is
 
06:47:13.620 --> 06:47:17.330 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question next up is
representative

06:47:17.330 --> 06:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:20.448 --> 06:47:20.458 align:start position:0%
uh yeah always make sure can you hear me
 
06:47:23.448 --> 06:47:23.458 align:start position:0%
yes chairman okay great I just want to
 
06:47:25.850 --> 06:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
clarify a couple of things I think what
 
06:47:27.350 --> 06:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
we were hearing here we were talking
 
06:47:28.968 --> 06:47:28.978 align:start position:0%
about this and maybe you can tell me if
 
06:47:33.830 --> 06:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'm correct the cost of the uh RPS at
 
06:47:36.048 --> 06:47:36.058 align:start position:0%
least on my electric bill came out in
 
06:47:38.030 --> 06:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
December because we passed the bill a
 
06:47:40.010 --> 06:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
couple years ago and we could only get
 
06:47:43.548 --> 06:47:43.558 align:start position:0%
it to be charged once a year so if you
 
06:47:45.468 --> 06:47:45.478 align:start position:0%
look really close in your electric bill
 
06:47:48.770 --> 06:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
in December you would find that it's uh
 
06:47:52.250 --> 06:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
about eight percent of the cost of the
 
06:47:54.468 --> 06:47:54.478 align:start position:0%
energy costs not the total bill so it's
 
06:47:56.510 --> 06:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
about three and a half percent cost of
 
06:47:59.030 --> 06:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
your total bill which no one's going to
 
06:48:01.190 --> 06:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
notice much one way or the other
 
06:48:04.070 --> 06:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand it is the actual
 
06:48:05.868 --> 06:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
savings that adds up over the course of
 
06:48:08.930 --> 06:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
the year and the towns and the
 
06:48:10.850 --> 06:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
municipalities would then save this
 
06:48:13.250 --> 06:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
money and again go back to the freedom
 
06:48:15.948 --> 06:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
idea they could choose to spend it or to
 
06:48:18.590 --> 06:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
rebate it to the taxpayers or do
 
06:48:19.730 --> 06:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
whatever they want with it is that
 
06:48:19.740 --> 06:48:21.410 align:start position:0%
whatever they want with it is that
correct

06:48:21.410 --> 06:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:48:23.868 --> 06:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
yes you are correct and the number you
 
06:48:25.730 --> 06:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
you mentioned of about three and a half
 
06:48:30.590 --> 06:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:33.048 --> 06:48:33.058 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up
 
06:48:34.910 --> 06:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
no I don't thank you
 
06:48:36.530 --> 06:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:48:41.690 --> 06:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:43.788 --> 06:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Vos
 
06:48:45.530 --> 06:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
um I just want to ask a procedural
 
06:48:48.410 --> 06:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
question on how this works um
 
06:48:51.708 --> 06:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
I hadn't read the amendment until just
 
06:48:51.718 --> 06:48:52.910 align:start position:0%
I hadn't read the amendment until just
now

06:48:52.910 --> 06:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:48:55.670 --> 06:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just wondering what the next
 
06:48:59.208 --> 06:48:59.218 align:start position:0%
step is uh for for reviewing this bill
 
06:49:00.948 --> 06:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like it would be a
 
06:49:02.390 --> 06:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
perfect Bill to have some kind of a
 
06:49:05.270 --> 06:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and bring in some testimony
 
06:49:08.570 --> 06:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
from some of our state agencies because
 
06:49:11.150 --> 06:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
I think it is worth looking at and
 
06:49:13.730 --> 06:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
understanding before we spend some time
 
06:49:13.740 --> 06:49:14.868 align:start position:0%
understanding before we spend some time
actually

06:49:14.868 --> 06:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
actually
 
06:49:14.878 --> 06:49:15.948 align:start position:0%
actually
um

06:49:15.948 --> 06:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:18.590 --> 06:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
passing it I think some of us have a lot
 
06:49:20.030 --> 06:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
of questions about it so I want to
 
06:49:21.830 --> 06:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
understand since this is a new Amendment
 
06:49:26.208 --> 06:49:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:28.850 --> 06:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh amendment that I will offer would
 
06:49:30.770 --> 06:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
have to be offered during an executive
 
06:49:30.780 --> 06:49:31.968 align:start position:0%
have to be offered during an executive
session

06:49:31.968 --> 06:49:31.978 align:start position:0%
session
 
06:49:33.890 --> 06:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:49:36.468 --> 06:49:36.478 align:start position:0%
if and when we have such a session I
 
06:49:39.468 --> 06:49:39.478 align:start position:0%
will offer that Amendment
 
06:49:41.990 --> 06:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
so follow-up is it possible to have some
 
06:49:43.850 --> 06:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
kind of a working committee before we do
 
06:49:46.250 --> 06:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
an exec session on this
 
06:49:48.468 --> 06:49:48.478 align:start position:0%
it is possible
 
06:49:51.230 --> 06:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we'll have the time or
 
06:49:54.170 --> 06:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
the space to do that but uh I'll give
 
06:49:56.390 --> 06:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
that some serious consideration thank
 
06:49:56.400 --> 06:49:57.830 align:start position:0%
that some serious consideration thank
you

06:49:57.830 --> 06:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:50:01.310 --> 06:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
next up would be uh representative Mann
 
06:50:02.810 --> 06:50:02.820 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
06:50:04.490 --> 06:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington would you put
 
06:50:06.350 --> 06:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
your hand down please unless you have
 
06:50:09.048 --> 06:50:09.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:12.468 --> 06:50:12.478 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Mann
 
06:50:24.530 --> 06:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:26.330 --> 06:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:50:26.340 --> 06:50:28.850 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

06:50:28.850 --> 06:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:32.690 --> 06:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
I kind of think of this as a somewhat
 
06:50:37.190 --> 06:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
Maybe I'm Wrong someone less important
 
06:50:40.070 --> 06:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
issue to deal with the little bits of
 
06:50:42.530 --> 06:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
money that people have to pay for taxes
 
06:50:43.730 --> 06:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
and stuff
 
06:50:45.230 --> 06:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
but um
 
06:50:47.930 --> 06:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why of all ways to save
 
06:50:50.690 --> 06:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
money we're going to choose one
 
06:50:53.090 --> 06:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
that reduces our response to climate
 
06:50:55.670 --> 06:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
change given that our children
 
06:50:58.610 --> 06:50:58.620 align:start position:0%
and our grandchildren have to live in
 
06:51:03.288 --> 06:51:03.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:06.230 --> 06:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
was there a question there yes
 
06:51:09.410 --> 06:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
why are we why is this important enough
 
06:51:12.770 --> 06:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:16.190 --> 06:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
why is this way of doing it uh from my
 
06:51:19.430 --> 06:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
perspective perspective uh
 
06:51:23.510 --> 06:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
we as legislators have a public policy
 
06:51:26.270 --> 06:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
obligation to the people who elected us
 
06:51:26.280 --> 06:51:27.770 align:start position:0%
obligation to the people who elected us
and

06:51:27.770 --> 06:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:51:30.048 --> 06:51:30.058 align:start position:0%
in my district I'm getting a lot of
 
06:51:32.030 --> 06:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
people asking me to
 
06:51:34.128 --> 06:51:34.138 align:start position:0%
for the state to provide a way to reduce
 
06:51:37.850 --> 06:51:37.860 align:start position:0%
their property taxes and so I'm trying
 
06:51:42.650 --> 06:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:42.660 --> 06:51:44.930 align:start position:0%
 
if

06:51:44.930 --> 06:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:51:44.940 --> 06:51:46.548 align:start position:0%
if
that choices

06:51:46.548 --> 06:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
that choices
 
06:51:49.850 --> 06:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
important public policy issue and one
 
06:51:53.208 --> 06:51:53.218 align:start position:0%
that we should always air on the side of
 
06:51:55.670 --> 06:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
giving people more choices rather than
 
06:51:58.128 --> 06:51:58.138 align:start position:0%
fewer choices
 
06:52:02.390 --> 06:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
well um follow up follow up thinking can
 
06:52:04.910 --> 06:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
I follow up yes
 
06:52:04.920 --> 06:52:05.810 align:start position:0%
I follow up yes
um

06:52:05.810 --> 06:52:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:52:08.208 --> 06:52:08.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:10.430 --> 06:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
you know one way the state for example
 
06:52:12.530 --> 06:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
could lower
 
06:52:15.770 --> 06:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
property taxes would be to
 
06:52:19.610 --> 06:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:22.850 --> 06:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits of an income tax is
 
06:52:24.770 --> 06:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
when we do things that make the economy
 
06:52:24.780 --> 06:52:25.910 align:start position:0%
when we do things that make the economy
better

06:52:25.910 --> 06:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
better
 
06:52:28.490 --> 06:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
the government notices an increase
 
06:52:31.310 --> 06:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
in their collections whoa whoa whoa whoa
 
06:52:35.930 --> 06:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:39.708 --> 06:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
why I'm just saying why why
 
06:52:42.170 --> 06:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
one of our priorities is to deal with
 
06:52:44.090 --> 06:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
the future of climate change well I pick
 
06:52:46.730 --> 06:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
this way rather than all sorts of other
 
06:52:48.490 --> 06:52:48.500 align:start position:0%
ways to
 
06:52:52.128 --> 06:52:52.138 align:start position:0%
reduce taxes I mean why shouldn't for
 
06:52:53.930 --> 06:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
example I'd be very happy to pay an
 
06:52:55.670 --> 06:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
income tax if I knew most of it was
 
06:52:58.128 --> 06:52:58.138 align:start position:0%
going to education for anybody in the
 
06:52:58.138 --> 06:53:00.230 align:start position:0%
going to education for anybody in the
state

06:53:00.230 --> 06:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:53:02.208 --> 06:53:02.218 align:start position:0%
I don't care I don't have kids my kids
 
06:53:04.750 --> 06:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
are 50 years old
 
06:53:07.368 --> 06:53:07.378 align:start position:0%
well representative man I can tell you
 
06:53:09.350 --> 06:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
that in every state where that's been
 
06:53:09.360 --> 06:53:10.610 align:start position:0%
that in every state where that's been
tried

06:53:10.610 --> 06:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
tried
 
06:53:13.368 --> 06:53:13.378 align:start position:0%
imposing an income tax in an effort to
 
06:53:15.708 --> 06:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
lower properties taxes it has not worked
 
06:53:18.190 --> 06:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
it has never worked
 
06:53:26.150 --> 06:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:27.830 --> 06:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
well thank you I thought somebody was
 
06:53:29.628 --> 06:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
trying to get my attention I apologize
 
06:53:31.788 --> 06:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
representative Mann for interrupting no
 
06:53:33.890 --> 06:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
I'm finished I'm finished thank you okay
 
06:53:37.310 --> 06:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Kelly Fitz you
 
06:53:39.410 --> 06:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
said the uh
 
06:53:41.990 --> 06:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
the utilities were on the line I I I
 
06:53:44.270 --> 06:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
can't see who's on the line and who's
 
06:53:48.770 --> 06:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
not but I would like to ask for
 
06:53:52.910 --> 06:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
the usage at least for my town
 
06:53:56.570 --> 06:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh Portsmouth and what their RPS payment
 
06:54:00.410 --> 06:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
is and if they had that as a breakdown
 
06:54:03.650 --> 06:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
uh by town I would like to do that but I
 
06:54:08.390 --> 06:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:12.230 --> 06:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:14.570 --> 06:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh I see
 
06:54:17.208 --> 06:54:17.218 align:start position:0%
Donna Gamache on the line
 
06:54:19.490 --> 06:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
well I'll put Donna on the spot and ask
 
06:54:19.500 --> 06:54:20.628 align:start position:0%

06:54:23.350 --> 06:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
for that breakdown about how much money
 
06:54:26.770 --> 06:54:26.780 align:start position:0%
we're really going to say and how much
 
06:54:29.030 --> 06:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know and and
 
06:54:32.628 --> 06:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
if how much is in the RPS fund right now
 
06:54:35.090 --> 06:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
but I would like to know town by town
 
06:54:38.750 --> 06:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
because when we say low at taxes
 
06:54:41.570 --> 06:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
you know if you give somebody 20 cents
 
06:54:43.490 --> 06:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
the town's going to spend it they're not
 
06:54:46.490 --> 06:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
going to lower the taxes that's the tax
 
06:54:50.090 --> 06:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
rate so I just want to know how much
 
06:54:50.100 --> 06:54:51.350 align:start position:0%
rate so I just want to know how much
it's

06:54:51.350 --> 06:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:54:54.650 --> 06:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
each town is going to have much each
 
06:54:58.670 --> 06:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
town has spent knowing that this year
 
06:55:02.030 --> 06:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
2019 is probably
 
06:55:04.850 --> 06:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
a high year because people have been
 
06:55:06.830 --> 06:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
home more but I don't know so I would
 
06:55:09.830 --> 06:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
like to see that if not if possible
 
06:55:12.948 --> 06:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
email it maybe email it to the committee
 
06:55:15.230 --> 06:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
is that possible Donna
 
06:55:17.150 --> 06:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
um I will do my best
 
06:55:19.730 --> 06:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
um my um I don't know that can I just
 
06:55:22.430 --> 06:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
say I don't know if it's possible I have
 
06:55:24.708 --> 06:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
gotten some feedback on this language
 
06:55:27.650 --> 06:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
and I know that they felt that
 
06:55:30.530 --> 06:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
um that it may be difficult for us to
 
06:55:32.330 --> 06:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
kind of separate some of this
 
06:55:34.310 --> 06:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
information out but I will double check
 
06:55:37.430 --> 06:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
to see a if it's something we can do to
 
06:55:40.128 --> 06:55:40.138 align:start position:0%
be able to tell you about Portsmouth
 
06:55:43.430 --> 06:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I cannot answer off the
 
06:55:46.368 --> 06:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
top of my head I have to admit that I
 
06:55:48.048 --> 06:55:48.058 align:start position:0%
have not been allowed back in my office
 
06:55:51.410 --> 06:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
since March 13th and all of my files are
 
06:55:53.048 --> 06:55:53.058 align:start position:0%
still there
 
06:55:56.208 --> 06:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
like everybody else right and so I don't
 
06:55:59.170 --> 06:55:59.180 align:start position:0%
have at my fingertips what on average
 
06:56:01.548 --> 06:56:01.558 align:start position:0%
all of our customers jointly have been
 
06:56:03.890 --> 06:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
paying for the RPS maybe the puc has
 
06:56:05.390 --> 06:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
that information they may be able to get
 
06:56:07.548 --> 06:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
it sooner than me but at the very same
 
06:56:10.190 --> 06:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
time I will check to see if I can get
 
06:56:12.230 --> 06:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
that information for you and I will make
 
06:56:13.968 --> 06:56:13.978 align:start position:0%
sure that whatever I get I share with
 
06:56:15.530 --> 06:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
all of you
 
06:56:18.650 --> 06:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
06:56:21.890 --> 06:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms Gamache do you have a copy
 
06:56:24.948 --> 06:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
of the amendment that I filed for this
 
06:56:29.090 --> 06:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
bill I do not I do not either you get a
 
06:56:32.150 --> 06:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
copy I think that would help with your
 
06:56:34.670 --> 06:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
06:56:39.590 --> 06:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh next up is representative McGee
 
06:56:39.600 --> 06:56:40.910 align:start position:0%
okay uh next up is representative McGee
thank you

06:56:40.910 --> 06:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:56:43.250 --> 06:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
are we going to hear from other people
 
06:56:45.110 --> 06:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
other other people waiting to testify
 
06:56:46.968 --> 06:56:46.978 align:start position:0%
that's one question and then I have one
 
06:56:49.788 --> 06:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:51.468 --> 06:56:51.478 align:start position:0%
are there other people who are planning
 
06:56:54.410 --> 06:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
to testify in this area there are okay
 
06:56:56.150 --> 06:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
the other people who are waiting to
 
06:56:59.030 --> 06:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
testify okay great
 
06:56:59.040 --> 06:56:59.628 align:start position:0%
testify okay great
great

06:56:59.628 --> 06:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
great
 
06:57:05.208 --> 06:57:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:08.208 --> 06:57:08.218 align:start position:0%
about at what cost because I think did
 
06:57:10.010 --> 06:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
you say that it was one thousand or two
 
06:57:12.590 --> 06:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
thousand that nothing would save
 
06:57:14.810 --> 06:57:14.820 align:start position:0%
your calculation at the beginning of
 
06:57:16.490 --> 06:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
your testimony your written testimony
 
06:57:18.410 --> 06:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
wasn't it 2000 in your written testimony
 
06:57:21.650 --> 06:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:23.570 --> 06:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
yes I believe it was the number was two
 
06:57:25.548 --> 06:57:25.558 align:start position:0%
thousand yes and once the number of
 
06:57:28.010 --> 06:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
people in Epping
 
06:57:31.850 --> 06:57:31.860 align:start position:0%
a few a little over seven thousand
 
06:57:34.968 --> 06:57:34.978 align:start position:0%
so those
 
06:57:36.770 --> 06:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
seven thousand
 
06:57:36.780 --> 06:57:38.030 align:start position:0%
seven thousand
by

06:57:38.030 --> 06:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:57:40.128 --> 06:57:40.138 align:start position:0%
a thousand divided by seven
 
06:57:42.350 --> 06:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
it's not like a you know it's a very low
 
06:57:43.968 --> 06:57:43.978 align:start position:0%
amount like a dollar forty or something
 
06:57:47.270 --> 06:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I I'm questioning at what cost
 
06:57:49.690 --> 06:57:49.700 align:start position:0%
we're gonna disrupt because
 
06:57:52.610 --> 06:57:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh that one that you guys want to spend
 
06:57:54.948 --> 06:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
for energy
 
06:58:01.010 --> 06:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:02.690 --> 06:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
but I think that people won't really
 
06:58:04.610 --> 06:58:04.620 align:start position:0%
notice and the idea is that in the queue
 
06:58:06.288 --> 06:58:06.298 align:start position:0%
in the cumulative the amount of good
 
06:58:08.330 --> 06:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
that that does is the reason you put the
 
06:58:11.090 --> 06:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
RPS standard in the first place so I
 
06:58:13.910 --> 06:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
guess what I want people to consider as
 
06:58:17.208 --> 06:58:17.218 align:start position:0%
we go forward is at what cost like if
 
06:58:19.368 --> 06:58:19.378 align:start position:0%
what is this bill gaining us it's not
 
06:58:21.350 --> 06:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
really lowering people's property taxes
 
06:58:23.510 --> 06:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
to the points that were made earlier and
 
06:58:25.368 --> 06:58:25.378 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to figure out what the
 
06:58:27.830 --> 06:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is so disruptive to
 
06:58:29.750 --> 06:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
the policy that really was confessions
 
06:58:31.368 --> 06:58:31.378 align:start position:0%
there's one
 
06:58:32.930 --> 06:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
um in the first place
 
06:58:35.208 --> 06:58:35.218 align:start position:0%
there's no proof it isn't working as
 
06:58:36.708 --> 06:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
intended so
 
06:58:39.708 --> 06:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for your opinion I remind you
 
06:58:45.048 --> 06:58:45.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:49.010 --> 06:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
also remind you that the money belongs
 
06:58:51.670 --> 06:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
to the people who earn it it's not ours
 
06:58:55.070 --> 06:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
and we should allow them to choose how
 
06:58:56.750 --> 06:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
they want to spend it
 
06:58:59.390 --> 06:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
next up is uh representative partial do
 
06:59:01.250 --> 06:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
06:59:02.750 --> 06:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
I do thank you for taking my question
 
06:59:02.760 --> 06:59:05.090 align:start position:0%
I do thank you for taking my question
Sheriff

06:59:05.090 --> 06:59:05.100 align:start position:0%
Sheriff
 
06:59:07.610 --> 06:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
um now first I have to say that I am not
 
06:59:10.250 --> 06:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
fully dispute on RPS and I would
 
06:59:12.288 --> 06:59:12.298 align:start position:0%
certainly benefit from more tutorials
 
06:59:14.510 --> 06:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
and more access to the various
 
06:59:16.070 --> 06:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
committees that could educate me on this
 
06:59:18.110 --> 06:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
I'm doing my best
 
06:59:20.270 --> 06:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm wondering why we can't earmark
 
06:59:23.390 --> 06:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
the funds that would be saved directly
 
06:59:25.070 --> 06:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
to public education
 
06:59:27.948 --> 06:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
you can have these if you reduce your
 
06:59:33.350 --> 06:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:36.170 --> 06:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
that's one question okay well the answer
 
06:59:38.810 --> 06:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
to that question is it's up to the
 
06:59:41.448 --> 06:59:41.458 align:start position:0%
cities and towns to decide how to spend
 
06:59:42.948 --> 06:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
their money
 
06:59:42.958 --> 06:59:44.150 align:start position:0%
their money
okay

06:59:44.150 --> 06:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:59:48.110 --> 06:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:49.850 --> 06:59:49.860 align:start position:0%
um this bill sounds like a potentially
 
06:59:51.530 --> 06:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
it could be a billing nightmare for
 
06:59:53.030 --> 06:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
finding out the cost for every uh
 
06:59:54.770 --> 06:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
municipality and uh
 
06:59:56.448 --> 06:59:56.458 align:start position:0%
uh in town
 
06:59:59.448 --> 06:59:59.458 align:start position:0%
and I'm just worried that any potential
 
07:00:02.030 --> 07:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
savings that might be made would be
 
07:00:05.570 --> 07:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
offset by uh the utilities billing
 
07:00:07.128 --> 07:00:07.138 align:start position:0%
procedures do you have any guarantee
 
07:00:09.708 --> 07:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
that will not be happening
 
07:00:12.048 --> 07:00:12.058 align:start position:0%
what billing features specifically are
 
07:00:13.670 --> 07:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
you referring to
 
07:00:16.250 --> 07:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's the calculation for every
 
07:00:18.048 --> 07:00:18.058 align:start position:0%
Municipality of what their contribution
 
07:00:20.208 --> 07:00:20.218 align:start position:0%
would be than dividing up among the
 
07:00:22.190 --> 07:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
individual utility bills
 
07:00:24.590 --> 07:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't understand as I said maybe
 
07:00:26.208 --> 07:00:26.218 align:start position:0%
I don't understand the entire situation
 
07:00:28.788 --> 07:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
but that's what occurs to me any
 
07:00:30.530 --> 07:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
potential cost could thus be offset
 
07:00:32.810 --> 07:00:32.820 align:start position:0%
immediately by
 
07:00:34.490 --> 07:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
um utilities
 
07:00:36.250 --> 07:00:36.260 align:start position:0%
having to
 
07:00:40.850 --> 07:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:43.850 --> 07:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh oh I think I get your point now
 
07:00:43.860 --> 07:00:44.448 align:start position:0%
uh oh I think I get your point now
um

07:00:44.448 --> 07:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:47.810 --> 07:00:47.820 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is worded providers of
 
07:00:49.788 --> 07:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
electricity shall not be subject to
 
07:00:53.628 --> 07:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
compliance under RSA 362 F3 for
 
07:00:55.010 --> 07:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
electricity sales that have been
 
07:00:57.468 --> 07:00:57.478 align:start position:0%
Exempted Exempted and pursuant to
 
07:01:00.230 --> 07:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
subparagraph a that basically means that
 
07:01:04.128 --> 07:01:04.138 align:start position:0%
when they calculate the number of
 
07:01:07.070 --> 07:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours on which they have to
 
07:01:10.730 --> 07:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
base their their electricity sales
 
07:01:14.030 --> 07:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
they just reduce it by the amount of the
 
07:01:15.770 --> 07:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
electricity from all these political
 
07:01:18.890 --> 07:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and the accounting for that
 
07:01:20.690 --> 07:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
should be fairly straightforward once
 
07:01:25.310 --> 07:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:27.650 --> 07:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
okay since we don't have any
 
07:01:29.990 --> 07:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
further questions at the moment but we
 
07:01:32.150 --> 07:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
do have three people who would like to
 
07:01:34.030 --> 07:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill I would like to Now
 
07:01:37.368 --> 07:01:37.378 align:start position:0%
call on Joseph quasnick
 
07:01:37.378 --> 07:01:38.690 align:start position:0%
call on Joseph quasnick
who

07:01:38.690 --> 07:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
who
 
07:01:39.830 --> 07:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
who is a member of the public
 
07:01:43.548 --> 07:01:43.558 align:start position:0%
represented himself and Mr quasnick the
 
07:01:46.548 --> 07:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
floor is yours thank you Mr chairman can
 
07:01:48.890 --> 07:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
you hear me
 
07:01:50.448 --> 07:01:50.458 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
07:01:51.770 --> 07:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for giving this
 
07:01:53.750 --> 07:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
me this opportunity to provide oral
 
07:01:56.690 --> 07:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
testimony and this is in opposition to
 
07:01:59.990 --> 07:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 650 614-ffn
 
07:02:02.150 --> 07:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to remind the committee that
 
07:02:04.490 --> 07:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
the compliance fees and costs incurred
 
07:02:06.170 --> 07:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
by state and political subdivisions
 
07:02:08.990 --> 07:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
under the RPS are invested in renewable
 
07:02:10.548 --> 07:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
energy projects
 
07:02:12.890 --> 07:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
these Investments result in lower
 
07:02:15.170 --> 07:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
electricity bills and electricity use
 
07:02:17.750 --> 07:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
with within the state of New Hampshire
 
07:02:19.788 --> 07:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
and it's my belief that they more than
 
07:02:22.190 --> 07:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
compensate for the cost of the RPS
 
07:02:24.890 --> 07:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
as we heard this morning on a house bill
 
07:02:27.948 --> 07:02:27.958 align:start position:0%
of 80. uh when we're able to reduce the
 
07:02:29.270 --> 07:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
amount of energy that's coming in from
 
07:02:31.670 --> 07:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
out of state sources uh it benefits
 
07:02:33.708 --> 07:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
every ratepayer and built there in the
 
07:02:35.570 --> 07:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we have reduced
 
07:02:37.670 --> 07:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
transmission costs reduced demand costs
 
07:02:39.830 --> 07:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
these projects will actually provide
 
07:02:42.770 --> 07:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
jobs very high paying jobs to people in
 
07:02:44.570 --> 07:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire area
 
07:02:46.968 --> 07:02:46.978 align:start position:0%
I also want to say that state and
 
07:02:48.590 --> 07:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
subdivisions should be providing an
 
07:02:51.110 --> 07:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
example to other regulated Bill payers
 
07:02:52.670 --> 07:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire of compliance with the
 
07:02:52.680 --> 07:02:53.650 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire of compliance with the
RPS

07:02:53.650 --> 07:02:53.660 align:start position:0%
RPS
 
07:02:58.250 --> 07:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
by providing acps and recs exempting the
 
07:03:00.110 --> 07:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
state in the subdivisions perverts the
 
07:03:02.930 --> 07:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
statutory impact of each end the purpose
 
07:03:05.570 --> 07:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
of the RPS to require all of just users
 
07:03:07.788 --> 07:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
in the state to contribute to these
 
07:03:10.430 --> 07:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
incentives for renewable energy projects
 
07:03:13.730 --> 07:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
but do as we say not as we do
 
07:03:13.740 --> 07:03:14.330 align:start position:0%
but do as we say not as we do
um

07:03:14.330 --> 07:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:03:16.968 --> 07:03:16.978 align:start position:0%
House Bill 614 should not pass as its
 
07:03:18.350 --> 07:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
intent to exempt the state and
 
07:03:20.270 --> 07:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
subdivision from compliance with the RPS
 
07:03:22.910 --> 07:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
is inconsistent with the original intent
 
07:03:25.430 --> 07:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the RPS legislation thank you very
 
07:03:26.868 --> 07:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
much for the opportunity to provide this
 
07:03:31.270 --> 07:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:34.430 --> 07:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
do we have anybody who would like to ask
 
07:03:37.548 --> 07:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:37.558 --> 07:03:39.288 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

07:03:39.288 --> 07:03:39.298 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:03:41.208 --> 07:03:41.218 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington you're
 
07:03:45.530 --> 07:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:47.810 --> 07:03:47.820 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just curious you you talk about
 
07:03:51.170 --> 07:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
leading uh from the towns and the states
 
07:03:52.788 --> 07:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
and telling other people what to do
 
07:03:54.948 --> 07:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
should how where else should we do this
 
07:03:56.810 --> 07:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
and should we in other words you can't
 
07:03:59.030 --> 07:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
trust the individual towns to make their
 
07:04:01.070 --> 07:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
own decisions so the state government
 
07:04:03.230 --> 07:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
has to tell them what to do and what
 
07:04:05.030 --> 07:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
else should we tell them what to do tell
 
07:04:07.368 --> 07:04:07.378 align:start position:0%
them how to vote how to do other things
 
07:04:08.628 --> 07:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
I mean where do you where do you draw
 
07:04:10.490 --> 07:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
the lines it's just electricity or do
 
07:04:11.628 --> 07:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
you want to have the state control
 
07:04:11.638 --> 07:04:12.890 align:start position:0%
you want to have the state control
everything

07:04:12.890 --> 07:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
everything
 
07:04:14.208 --> 07:04:14.218 align:start position:0%
let's pick up
 
07:04:16.010 --> 07:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
pick up this is argumentative and it's
 
07:04:17.510 --> 07:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
it is
 
07:04:19.250 --> 07:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'm going to speak up in favor of the
 
07:04:21.708 --> 07:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
public I don't think that's in order
 
07:04:23.930 --> 07:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
07:04:25.968 --> 07:04:25.978 align:start position:0%
nowhere to treat the public
 
07:04:28.610 --> 07:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm sorry I was I was
 
07:04:32.510 --> 07:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
distracted well I I wasn't and I I think
 
07:04:34.490 --> 07:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
that Mr Harrington's
 
07:04:37.910 --> 07:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh not question but statements to the
 
07:04:40.968 --> 07:04:40.978 align:start position:0%
public to Mr kozniak I'm sorry if I
 
07:04:44.270 --> 07:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
mispronounce it were inappropriate
 
07:04:46.430 --> 07:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
yes I'd like to answer that question if
 
07:04:47.448 --> 07:04:47.458 align:start position:0%
I could
 
07:04:47.458 --> 07:04:48.708 align:start position:0%
I could
oh

07:04:48.708 --> 07:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
oh
 
07:04:53.090 --> 07:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
Mr kwaziak yes well this isn't a debate
 
07:04:57.170 --> 07:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
on what the I I I I'm this is not a
 
07:04:58.610 --> 07:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
debate on what the government can tell
 
07:05:00.110 --> 07:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
you to do and what the government can't
 
07:05:02.390 --> 07:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
tell you to do and I think we need to
 
07:05:03.890 --> 07:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
stick to the bill
 
07:05:06.850 --> 07:05:06.860 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my point
 
07:05:09.650 --> 07:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
that's to the chair I'm sorry I didn't
 
07:05:11.570 --> 07:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
hear a representative Harrington's
 
07:05:14.510 --> 07:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
statement uh it may have been uh out of
 
07:05:17.030 --> 07:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
bounds but uh thank you for
 
07:05:19.128 --> 07:05:19.138 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that representative Kelly
 
07:05:19.138 --> 07:05:20.448 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that representative Kelly
fix

07:05:20.448 --> 07:05:20.458 align:start position:0%
fix
 
07:05:22.430 --> 07:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
but well if I can my statement was
 
07:05:24.170 --> 07:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
exactly what she said it's all about
 
07:05:25.610 --> 07:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
what the government can tell us to do
 
07:05:27.170 --> 07:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
and what the government can't tell us to
 
07:05:29.590 --> 07:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
do that's the whole issue here
 
07:05:32.510 --> 07:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
did you ask a question uh representative
 
07:05:34.788 --> 07:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
Harrington he did I asked him what his
 
07:05:36.770 --> 07:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
thoughts were on other issues if they
 
07:05:37.850 --> 07:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
thought that the government should
 
07:05:40.968 --> 07:05:40.978 align:start position:0%
should tell us to do everything not just
 
07:05:43.430 --> 07:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
how we buy electricity
 
07:05:45.610 --> 07:05:45.620 align:start position:0%
and not just quite that challenge
 
07:05:48.468 --> 07:05:48.478 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yeah I mean let's talk
 
07:05:49.968 --> 07:05:49.978 align:start position:0%
about what the government should do is
 
07:05:54.530 --> 07:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:56.868 --> 07:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
you respond Mr quasnick or did he want
 
07:05:56.878 --> 07:05:57.590 align:start position:0%
you respond Mr quasnick or did he want
to

07:05:57.590 --> 07:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:06:00.468 --> 07:06:00.478 align:start position:0%
um says he wants to I'm responding with
 
07:06:02.810 --> 07:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
my comments is that uh the legislature
 
07:06:05.030 --> 07:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
and its previous in previous sessions
 
07:06:09.010 --> 07:06:09.020 align:start position:0%
has passed uh the bill enacting the
 
07:06:12.288 --> 07:06:12.298 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standards and they
 
07:06:13.430 --> 07:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
thought this was an appropriate
 
07:06:13.440 --> 07:06:14.708 align:start position:0%
thought this was an appropriate
legislation

07:06:14.708 --> 07:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
07:06:17.750 --> 07:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
incorporating uh contributions to the
 
07:06:20.030 --> 07:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
RPS by all electricity used in the state
 
07:06:21.830 --> 07:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
and I stand by that and I think it's the
 
07:06:23.330 --> 07:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
right decision to make
 
07:06:26.150 --> 07:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:28.930 --> 07:06:28.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer
 
07:06:32.150 --> 07:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
has her hand raised I don't know if that
 
07:06:34.490 --> 07:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
means she wants to ask a question or if
 
07:06:37.610 --> 07:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
she has uh a response Ms Gamache I'll
 
07:06:44.510 --> 07:06:44.520 align:start position:0%

07:07:59.208 --> 07:07:59.218 align:start position:0%
testimony that I did submit a few days
 
07:08:02.990 --> 07:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
earlier is based on the
 
07:08:05.990 --> 07:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
um bill as as introduced
 
07:08:06.000 --> 07:08:06.948 align:start position:0%
um bill as as introduced
um

07:08:06.948 --> 07:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:09.830 --> 07:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
my I think I just wanted to really hit
 
07:08:11.690 --> 07:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
on two points
 
07:08:11.700 --> 07:08:12.490 align:start position:0%
on two points
um

07:08:12.490 --> 07:08:12.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:15.170 --> 07:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
one reason for our opposition is because
 
07:08:17.510 --> 07:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
we believe this bill will undermine the
 
07:08:20.628 --> 07:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standards program
 
07:08:22.010 --> 07:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
um and I think there has been some
 
07:08:23.930 --> 07:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
discussion uh that the fund really
 
07:08:27.230 --> 07:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
serves a key role in the market-based
 
07:08:30.468 --> 07:08:30.478 align:start position:0%
design of the state's RPS program
 
07:08:32.330 --> 07:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
um so essentially uh you know the
 
07:08:35.690 --> 07:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
qualifying renewable facilities produce
 
07:08:38.570 --> 07:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates every time
 
07:08:40.628 --> 07:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
they produce a megawatt Hour of Power
 
07:08:43.548 --> 07:08:43.558 align:start position:0%
the electricity providers can meet their
 
07:08:47.330 --> 07:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
RPS requirements by buying wrecks or if
 
07:08:49.070 --> 07:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
there are not enough wrecks available in
 
07:08:51.650 --> 07:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
the marketplace then they can meet their
 
07:08:54.048 --> 07:08:54.058 align:start position:0%
compliance obligations at least
 
07:08:55.910 --> 07:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
partially or in whole by making
 
07:08:58.730 --> 07:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments
 
07:09:00.890 --> 07:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
um and so the money that's deposited
 
07:09:03.468 --> 07:09:03.478 align:start position:0%
into the renewable energy fund is used
 
07:09:05.930 --> 07:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
to leverage private investment in
 
07:09:07.910 --> 07:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
renewable Generation
 
07:09:10.128 --> 07:09:10.138 align:start position:0%
Um that investment boosts the supply of
 
07:09:12.288 --> 07:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
renewable generation and the supply of
 
07:09:14.868 --> 07:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates and
 
07:09:17.208 --> 07:09:17.218 align:start position:0%
thereby making the rec markets more
 
07:09:20.330 --> 07:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
competitive and robust and helping to
 
07:09:22.968 --> 07:09:22.978 align:start position:0%
minimize RPS compliance costs for all
 
07:09:25.368 --> 07:09:25.378 align:start position:0%
rate payers and so
 
07:09:28.310 --> 07:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
um that is our concern
 
07:09:30.410 --> 07:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
um with kind of undercutting the role of
 
07:09:33.708 --> 07:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund and as I think
 
07:09:35.708 --> 07:09:35.718 align:start position:0%
was discussed earlier
 
07:09:39.530 --> 07:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy certificates are a
 
07:09:42.890 --> 07:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
much more cost effective way to comply
 
07:09:45.468 --> 07:09:45.478 align:start position:0%
with the RPS requirements than making
 
07:09:47.810 --> 07:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
ACP payments
 
07:09:52.090 --> 07:09:52.100 align:start position:0%
um and so the more we can do to
 
07:09:54.530 --> 07:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
encourage compliance through the rec
 
07:09:57.048 --> 07:09:57.058 align:start position:0%
markets the better that's going to be
 
07:09:59.090 --> 07:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
the more cost effect that's going to be
 
07:10:02.270 --> 07:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire rate payers the other
 
07:10:05.750 --> 07:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
thing I would simply note is that
 
07:10:08.090 --> 07:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
another reason for our opposition is
 
07:10:10.070 --> 07:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
that we feel like this introduces a
 
07:10:12.530 --> 07:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
slippery slope to more and more
 
07:10:12.540 --> 07:10:13.868 align:start position:0%
slippery slope to more and more
exemptions

07:10:13.868 --> 07:10:13.878 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
07:10:16.250 --> 07:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
obviously if the state and political
 
07:10:19.070 --> 07:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
entities are granted an exemption other
 
07:10:21.830 --> 07:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
groups will most certainly come to the
 
07:10:24.230 --> 07:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
legislature seeking exemptions as well
 
07:10:26.510 --> 07:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
and of course the more exemptions are
 
07:10:28.670 --> 07:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
Grant the more exemptions that you grant
 
07:10:31.390 --> 07:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
the more the RPS program will be
 
07:10:33.830 --> 07:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
undermined so
 
07:10:35.810 --> 07:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
um those are my the two points that I
 
07:10:37.610 --> 07:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
wanted to make I know you have a time
 
07:10:40.070 --> 07:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
limit and I'd be happy to answer any
 
07:10:42.410 --> 07:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
questions and I do appreciate your time
 
07:10:45.170 --> 07:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
and consideration this afternoon and
 
07:10:47.868 --> 07:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
listening to my comments
 
07:10:49.730 --> 07:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss crawl I would just
 
07:10:53.750 --> 07:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
respond by uh assuring that acts have
 
07:10:55.868 --> 07:10:55.878 align:start position:0%
been removed from the bill altogether
 
07:10:58.490 --> 07:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
there's a different approach in the
 
07:11:01.128 --> 07:11:01.138 align:start position:0%
amendment so that would alleviate your
 
07:11:03.830 --> 07:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
concern over acbs
 
07:11:07.968 --> 07:11:07.978 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman may I ask a question yes how
 
07:11:09.830 --> 07:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
would I go about getting a copy of that
 
07:11:09.840 --> 07:11:11.628 align:start position:0%
would I go about getting a copy of that
Amendment

07:11:11.628 --> 07:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
07:11:15.530 --> 07:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh since you sent us a written copy of
 
07:11:18.170 --> 07:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
your testimony I have your email address
 
07:11:20.868 --> 07:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
and so I will send you a copy how's that
 
07:11:23.930 --> 07:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're very welcome
 
07:11:26.810 --> 07:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
does any member of the committee have a
 
07:11:29.930 --> 07:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
question for Liz growl
 
07:11:32.990 --> 07:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
anybody online have a question for this
 
07:11:33.000 --> 07:11:36.350 align:start position:0%
anybody online have a question for this
girl

07:11:36.350 --> 07:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:38.448 --> 07:11:38.458 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington you still have
 
07:11:40.610 --> 07:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
your hand up do you have a question uh
 
07:11:43.190 --> 07:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
yes I do Mr chairman uh very quickly uh
 
07:11:45.170 --> 07:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
Miss Kroll since you're testifying
 
07:11:47.030 --> 07:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
against the bill I assume it's going to
 
07:11:49.010 --> 07:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
cost you clients money could you give us
 
07:11:50.448 --> 07:11:50.458 align:start position:0%
an estimate of how much money your
 
07:11:54.590 --> 07:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:54.600 --> 07:11:55.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:11:55.250 --> 07:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:11:58.490 --> 07:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
I don't have an estimate of that
 
07:11:58.500 --> 07:12:00.170 align:start position:0%
I don't have an estimate of that
um representative

07:12:00.170 --> 07:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
07:12:00.180 --> 07:12:01.010 align:start position:0%
um representative
um

07:12:01.010 --> 07:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:12:02.390 --> 07:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
there might have been some information
 
07:12:02.400 --> 07:12:03.708 align:start position:0%
there might have been some information
given

07:12:03.708 --> 07:12:03.718 align:start position:0%
given
 
07:12:06.410 --> 07:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
um earlier but I don't have data about
 
07:12:08.448 --> 07:12:08.458 align:start position:0%
how much
 
07:12:11.030 --> 07:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
um each town and each political
 
07:12:13.730 --> 07:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
subdivision and the state
 
07:12:16.250 --> 07:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
um you know I think there are Myriad of
 
07:12:18.468 --> 07:12:18.478 align:start position:0%
scenarios where
 
07:12:18.478 --> 07:12:19.490 align:start position:0%
scenarios where
um

07:12:19.490 --> 07:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:12:23.150 --> 07:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
all or none or some portion of folks
 
07:12:23.160 --> 07:12:24.230 align:start position:0%
all or none or some portion of folks
could

07:12:24.230 --> 07:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
could
 
07:12:27.590 --> 07:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
um uh remain up I guess that I guess the
 
07:12:29.750 --> 07:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
default here is that you opt out
 
07:12:31.128 --> 07:12:31.138 align:start position:0%
um and then you might be able to opt
 
07:12:34.010 --> 07:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
back into the RPS program but
 
07:12:36.948 --> 07:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
um so first of all I'm not sure how and
 
07:12:39.048 --> 07:12:39.058 align:start position:0%
I unless there's a new fiscal note I I
 
07:12:41.510 --> 07:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
haven't seen data so uh without more
 
07:12:44.390 --> 07:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
information I would not be able to
 
07:12:44.400 --> 07:12:45.590 align:start position:0%
information I would not be able to
um

07:12:45.590 --> 07:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:12:47.930 --> 07:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
to answer that question I'm sorry
 
07:12:51.410 --> 07:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
a follow-up Mr chairman yes go ahead uh
 
07:12:53.270 --> 07:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
well so I understand that's really
 
07:12:55.610 --> 07:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
difficult to get down to Brass tax on
 
07:12:57.650 --> 07:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
that but is it safe to assume that your
 
07:12:59.390 --> 07:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
clients will lose money if this bill was
 
07:12:59.400 --> 07:13:02.628 align:start position:0%
clients will lose money if this bill was
passed

07:13:02.628 --> 07:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:05.208 --> 07:13:05.218 align:start position:0%
well I don't know if that's true or not
 
07:13:07.490 --> 07:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
I mean the compliance
 
07:13:10.548 --> 07:13:10.558 align:start position:0%
um with with respect to the RPS
 
07:13:13.910 --> 07:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
requirement for class four
 
07:13:17.990 --> 07:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
um the requirement is a 1.5 requirement
 
07:13:19.190 --> 07:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
which is
 
07:13:22.510 --> 07:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
um fairly low uh fairly low requirement
 
07:13:25.310 --> 07:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
among the classes
 
07:13:28.430 --> 07:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
um and different entities have a
 
07:13:31.490 --> 07:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
different mix of compliance
 
07:13:36.288 --> 07:13:36.298 align:start position:0%
um approaches so uh some predominantly
 
07:13:38.448 --> 07:13:38.458 align:start position:0%
buy renewable energy certificates to
 
07:13:41.208 --> 07:13:41.218 align:start position:0%
meet that requirement others do a mix of
 
07:13:44.208 --> 07:13:44.218 align:start position:0%
wrecks and acps
 
07:13:46.788 --> 07:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
um and so you know if there's some sort
 
07:13:46.798 --> 07:13:47.628 align:start position:0%
um and so you know if there's some sort
of

07:13:47.628 --> 07:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:13:47.638 --> 07:13:48.830 align:start position:0%
of
um

07:13:48.830 --> 07:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:52.250 --> 07:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
reduction I guess in in what the
 
07:13:55.010 --> 07:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
requirement is in terms of
 
07:13:56.750 --> 07:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know meeting the overall requirement
 
07:14:00.230 --> 07:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
that could that could simply uh
 
07:14:02.868 --> 07:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
come off the ACP Side Of The Ledger or
 
07:14:04.788 --> 07:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
it could come off the wreck Side Of The
 
07:14:04.798 --> 07:14:05.750 align:start position:0%
it could come off the wreck Side Of The
Ledger

07:14:05.750 --> 07:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
Ledger
 
07:14:05.760 --> 07:14:07.070 align:start position:0%
Ledger
so

07:14:07.070 --> 07:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:14:07.080 --> 07:14:08.330 align:start position:0%
so
um

07:14:08.330 --> 07:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:14:10.610 --> 07:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
I I'm not trying to be evasive I just
 
07:14:13.310 --> 07:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
don't have enough information certainly
 
07:14:16.610 --> 07:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
if if the number of wrecks that are
 
07:14:19.968 --> 07:14:19.978 align:start position:0%
purchased declines then that would mean
 
07:14:21.708 --> 07:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
uh less
 
07:14:25.310 --> 07:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
um revenue from from selling wrecks or
 
07:14:27.170 --> 07:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
it could be that just the wreck prices
 
07:14:27.180 --> 07:14:28.910 align:start position:0%
it could be that just the wreck prices
decline

07:14:28.910 --> 07:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
decline
 
07:14:28.920 --> 07:14:29.510 align:start position:0%
decline
um

07:14:29.510 --> 07:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:14:32.628 --> 07:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
so it's it's kind of tricky for me to
 
07:14:34.010 --> 07:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
07:14:36.048 --> 07:14:36.058 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much appreciate it
 
07:14:38.208 --> 07:14:38.218 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question next
 
07:14:42.288 --> 07:14:42.298 align:start position:0%
step is representative samsich
 
07:14:44.868 --> 07:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh just to
 
07:14:46.910 --> 07:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Harrington's
 
07:14:48.590 --> 07:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
question and I don't want to be too
 
07:14:50.690 --> 07:14:50.700 align:start position:0%
specific Miss Krull but
 
07:14:53.990 --> 07:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
um uh I think his question uh is similar
 
07:14:56.270 --> 07:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
to what I I'm wondering
 
07:14:59.448 --> 07:14:59.458 align:start position:0%
um in general uh if we look at the the
 
07:15:01.910 --> 07:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
bill as written right now and I don't
 
07:15:03.650 --> 07:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
have the amended version in front of me
 
07:15:03.660 --> 07:15:04.548 align:start position:0%
have the amended version in front of me
either

07:15:04.548 --> 07:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
either
 
07:15:07.250 --> 07:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
but if you look at that can you give us
 
07:15:10.850 --> 07:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
some idea of how uh your clients
 
07:15:14.390 --> 07:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
perceive a potential impact to their
 
07:15:17.208 --> 07:15:17.218 align:start position:0%
businesses their New Hampshire Hydro uh
 
07:15:19.548 --> 07:15:19.558 align:start position:0%
facilities here in New Hampshire how
 
07:15:20.930 --> 07:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
they perceive
 
07:15:23.510 --> 07:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
what type of impact they perceive that
 
07:15:25.910 --> 07:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
could happen to them
 
07:15:27.708 --> 07:15:27.718 align:start position:0%
uh mature so there's there's two
 
07:15:29.930 --> 07:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
different ways I think that there would
 
07:15:31.548 --> 07:15:31.558 align:start position:0%
be impacts
 
07:15:34.250 --> 07:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
um one is that you know New Hampshire's
 
07:15:37.070 --> 07:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
small-scale Hydro facilities
 
07:15:39.048 --> 07:15:39.058 align:start position:0%
um you know their local businesses they
 
07:15:40.548 --> 07:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
employ local
 
07:15:43.968 --> 07:15:43.978 align:start position:0%
um uh residents they they try to do
 
07:15:45.468 --> 07:15:45.478 align:start position:0%
their best to use
 
07:15:48.708 --> 07:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
um local vendors and service providers
 
07:15:50.810 --> 07:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
whether it's um you know from the
 
07:15:52.788 --> 07:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
Machinery side of things to you know
 
07:15:55.910 --> 07:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
accountants and that sort of thing so
 
07:15:58.850 --> 07:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
um and they make you know they their
 
07:16:01.070 --> 07:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
revenue stream is what allows them to
 
07:16:04.730 --> 07:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
pay for services and also to pay for the
 
07:16:08.390 --> 07:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance and any sort of upgrades
 
07:16:11.570 --> 07:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
um to their uh facilities
 
07:16:13.968 --> 07:16:13.978 align:start position:0%
um a lot of those are are mandated
 
07:16:16.730 --> 07:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
um uh by ferc and other Regulatory
 
07:16:20.510 --> 07:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
Agencies so they're certainly the
 
07:16:23.930 --> 07:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
um impact that uh
 
07:16:26.930 --> 07:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
there could be a a great deal of
 
07:16:26.940 --> 07:16:28.270 align:start position:0%
there could be a a great deal of
instability

07:16:28.270 --> 07:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
instability
 
07:16:32.330 --> 07:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
introduced into the revenue stream that
 
07:16:34.010 --> 07:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
comes from selling renewable energy
 
07:16:36.410 --> 07:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
certificates and that you know as you
 
07:16:37.910 --> 07:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
know businesses
 
07:16:40.310 --> 07:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
um do not like uncertainty and so that
 
07:16:44.510 --> 07:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
could have an impact on um uh how they
 
07:16:46.368 --> 07:16:46.378 align:start position:0%
run their businesses
 
07:16:49.548 --> 07:16:49.558 align:start position:0%
um you know scaling back on staff
 
07:16:51.948 --> 07:16:51.958 align:start position:0%
um scaling back on the services and and
 
07:16:53.690 --> 07:16:53.700 align:start position:0%
and obviously they're not going to skimp
 
07:16:55.850 --> 07:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
on maintenance but um they may put off
 
07:16:58.250 --> 07:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
other things that should be done and
 
07:17:00.948 --> 07:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
maybe they could delay so there's
 
07:17:00.958 --> 07:17:01.788 align:start position:0%
maybe they could delay so there's
um

07:17:01.788 --> 07:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:17:04.010 --> 07:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh there's that piece and then the other
 
07:17:07.190 --> 07:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
piece is there have been several
 
07:17:09.170 --> 07:17:09.180 align:start position:0%
small-scale Hydro facilities in New
 
07:17:12.128 --> 07:17:12.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have participated in the
 
07:17:14.990 --> 07:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
competitive RFP that the public
 
07:17:17.628 --> 07:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
utilities puts out every year
 
07:17:19.070 --> 07:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
um where
 
07:17:19.080 --> 07:17:19.730 align:start position:0%
um where
um

07:17:19.730 --> 07:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:17:22.250 --> 07:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
projects that are not solar related and
 
07:17:27.288 --> 07:17:27.298 align:start position:0%
kind of um uh you know rebate based
 
07:17:30.410 --> 07:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
programs uh the puc also runs out of the
 
07:17:31.968 --> 07:17:31.978 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund a competitive
 
07:17:34.010 --> 07:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
grant program
 
07:17:36.530 --> 07:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
um and it's you have to compete you have
 
07:17:38.330 --> 07:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that your project is
 
07:17:38.340 --> 07:17:39.530 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that your project is
worthy

07:17:39.530 --> 07:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
worthy
 
07:17:41.330 --> 07:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
um in terms of what what investment
 
07:17:43.310 --> 07:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to make with the grant
 
07:17:45.230 --> 07:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
money how much you're going to leverage
 
07:17:48.650 --> 07:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
that with your own investment
 
07:17:52.250 --> 07:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
um and in-kind contributions and how
 
07:17:54.288 --> 07:17:54.298 align:start position:0%
many renewable additional renewable
 
07:17:56.570 --> 07:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
energy certificates your project will
 
07:17:56.580 --> 07:17:58.070 align:start position:0%
energy certificates your project will
yield

07:17:58.070 --> 07:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
yield
 
07:18:00.110 --> 07:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to say that a number of
 
07:18:02.270 --> 07:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
hydro facilities have won those
 
07:18:04.670 --> 07:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
competitive grants and made those
 
07:18:06.708 --> 07:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
investments in New Hampshire's
 
07:18:09.590 --> 07:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
small-scale Hydro facilities and so if
 
07:18:13.070 --> 07:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
there is a um a loss of
 
07:18:15.230 --> 07:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
money going into the renewable energy
 
07:18:18.110 --> 07:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
fund than presumably that could have an
 
07:18:20.570 --> 07:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
impact on those on the competitive grant
 
07:18:22.910 --> 07:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
program as well
 
07:18:25.670 --> 07:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you next step
 
07:18:29.690 --> 07:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
would be representative oxenham
 
07:18:32.750 --> 07:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
yes I I almost feel like I got the
 
07:18:34.910 --> 07:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
answer at that time but just just to
 
07:18:37.788 --> 07:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
nail it down uh Ms Carl could could you
 
07:18:40.070 --> 07:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
you said something about and twice about
 
07:18:43.070 --> 07:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
the leveraging of private investment I
 
07:18:45.530 --> 07:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
mean this renewable energy fund money
 
07:18:48.530 --> 07:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay for a damn upgrade or you
 
07:18:51.708 --> 07:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
know I mean projects get a proportion
 
07:18:54.288 --> 07:18:54.298 align:start position:0%
and then you go into the private market
 
07:18:57.230 --> 07:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm asking the question I'm trying
 
07:18:58.670 --> 07:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
to give you the answer instead of asking
 
07:19:00.948 --> 07:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
you the question how does that work this
 
07:19:03.110 --> 07:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
this notion of leveraging private
 
07:19:06.650 --> 07:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
investment money through fund money yep
 
07:19:10.010 --> 07:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
so the grant um that the small-scale
 
07:19:14.090 --> 07:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
hydro folks have um uh gotten I think
 
07:19:16.610 --> 07:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
have ranged in the hundred and fifty
 
07:19:19.010 --> 07:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
thousand to maybe
 
07:19:21.830 --> 07:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
um 250 000 range
 
07:19:24.048 --> 07:19:24.058 align:start position:0%
um I don't have specific numbers right
 
07:19:25.610 --> 07:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
here in front of me but that's the order
 
07:19:27.350 --> 07:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
of magnitude of a grant that we're
 
07:19:29.390 --> 07:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
talking about we're not talking about a
 
07:19:30.890 --> 07:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars or a million
 
07:19:32.810 --> 07:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
dollars or anything of that order of
 
07:19:32.820 --> 07:19:34.490 align:start position:0%
dollars or anything of that order of
magnitude

07:19:34.490 --> 07:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
magnitude
 
07:19:37.610 --> 07:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I believe that actually
 
07:19:40.250 --> 07:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that the P you know the
 
07:19:44.030 --> 07:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
puc has a a set of criteria that it uses
 
07:19:46.910 --> 07:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
to assess who's a winner and and who's
 
07:19:48.770 --> 07:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
not a winner and I believe that one of
 
07:19:51.708 --> 07:19:51.718 align:start position:0%
those criteria is in fact
 
07:19:54.350 --> 07:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
um how much leverage you're you're
 
07:19:56.868 --> 07:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
offering so you know for every dollar in
 
07:19:59.390 --> 07:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
the grant how much are is the project
 
07:20:01.070 --> 07:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
putting in
 
07:20:03.708 --> 07:20:03.718 align:start position:0%
um either of their own money or in-kind
 
07:20:05.628 --> 07:20:05.638 align:start position:0%
contribution which obviously has some
 
07:20:05.638 --> 07:20:06.530 align:start position:0%
contribution which obviously has some
value

07:20:06.530 --> 07:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
value
 
07:20:09.288 --> 07:20:09.298 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the hydro folks uh
 
07:20:11.690 --> 07:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
um uh do their own their own work
 
07:20:12.890 --> 07:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
themselves you know they're out there
 
07:20:15.770 --> 07:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
with the Backhoe or whatever it might be
 
07:20:18.708 --> 07:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
um so I believe that that ratio on
 
07:20:22.430 --> 07:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
average is about a one to six ratio so
 
07:20:24.948 --> 07:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
for every dollar of grant money that's
 
07:20:27.590 --> 07:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
invested in a in a project in that
 
07:20:30.590 --> 07:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
competitive program you get about six
 
07:20:32.750 --> 07:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
other dollars worth of
 
07:20:34.548 --> 07:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
um investment that comes from the
 
07:20:36.948 --> 07:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
private sector uh that I believe that's
 
07:20:38.510 --> 07:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
the average I don't want to say that
 
07:20:40.448 --> 07:20:40.458 align:start position:0%
that's specific to each Hydro facility
 
07:20:43.010 --> 07:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
that that's my understanding about the
 
07:20:43.020 --> 07:20:44.270 align:start position:0%
that that's my understanding about the
average

07:20:44.270 --> 07:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
average
 
07:20:48.410 --> 07:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:51.288 --> 07:20:51.298 align:start position:0%
um and and that money is invested that
 
07:20:54.948 --> 07:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
six to one that increase in in market
 
07:20:57.110 --> 07:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
economy is happening here in New
 
07:20:58.670 --> 07:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that money is not part of the
 
07:21:00.110 --> 07:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
three to four billion dollars being
 
07:21:02.208 --> 07:21:02.218 align:start position:0%
shipped out of the state am I correct
 
07:21:05.510 --> 07:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
oh no these are all um uh you have to be
 
07:21:06.948 --> 07:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
an in-state
 
07:21:10.010 --> 07:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
um uh renewable energy facility to even
 
07:21:12.230 --> 07:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
qualify for any of the money in the
 
07:21:14.628 --> 07:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund so those projects
 
07:21:17.150 --> 07:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
are all taking place right here in New
 
07:21:17.160 --> 07:21:18.530 align:start position:0%
are all taking place right here in New
Hampshire

07:21:18.530 --> 07:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
07:21:21.948 --> 07:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
um and communities throughout the state
 
07:21:24.110 --> 07:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
um and uh the other thing I will just
 
07:21:27.048 --> 07:21:27.058 align:start position:0%
emphasize is that those projects
 
07:21:30.770 --> 07:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
um are graded are ranked if you will in
 
07:21:33.830 --> 07:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
terms of how many additional new
 
07:21:36.708 --> 07:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates will the
 
07:21:40.070 --> 07:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
project generate and so that is one of
 
07:21:42.830 --> 07:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
the criteria that's used to determine
 
07:21:44.930 --> 07:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
who is a winner so these are all
 
07:21:47.150 --> 07:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
projects that at the end of the day when
 
07:21:49.430 --> 07:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
the project is complete
 
07:21:51.770 --> 07:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
um we'll be generating more renewable
 
07:21:54.530 --> 07:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
energy certificates in this example with
 
07:21:57.650 --> 07:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
Hydro in class four
 
07:21:59.628 --> 07:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
um and those are more renewable energy
 
07:22:02.510 --> 07:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
certificates that are out there in the
 
07:22:06.708 --> 07:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
market for the suppliers to buy
 
07:22:09.410 --> 07:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
um and as I indicated in the testimony
 
07:22:12.650 --> 07:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
uh at least last year on average class
 
07:22:14.810 --> 07:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
four wrecks were selling at about 30
 
07:22:17.628 --> 07:22:17.638 align:start position:0%
percent below the market prices for
 
07:22:21.230 --> 07:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
class 4 Rex for around 30 percent below
 
07:22:23.270 --> 07:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
um the ACP price
 
07:22:26.330 --> 07:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
so and obviously basic supply and demand
 
07:22:28.368 --> 07:22:28.378 align:start position:0%
tells you that the more renewable energy
 
07:22:30.708 --> 07:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
certificates that are out there that
 
07:22:33.048 --> 07:22:33.058 align:start position:0%
will bring the price down even even more
 
07:22:35.270 --> 07:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
and as I indicated to
 
07:22:38.288 --> 07:22:38.298 align:start position:0%
um class 4 uh
 
07:22:40.430 --> 07:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
requirement in terms of on the
 
07:22:43.010 --> 07:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
purchasing so you know the obligation
 
07:22:45.048 --> 07:22:45.058 align:start position:0%
that the suppliers have
 
07:22:48.410 --> 07:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
um is a it's a 1.5 percent that's flat
 
07:22:52.670 --> 07:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
there is no um uh increasing of that
 
07:22:55.250 --> 07:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
over time like there are um I think at
 
07:22:58.190 --> 07:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
least for class one thank you Ms Crowe
 
07:23:00.830 --> 07:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
for that uh answer we have one final
 
07:23:13.190 --> 07:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:14.868 --> 07:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
possible thank you
 
07:23:17.590 --> 07:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yeah louder
 
07:23:21.048 --> 07:23:21.058 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry you know what I have a desk
 
07:23:22.730 --> 07:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
in front of me so I'm not near my mic
 
07:23:24.530 --> 07:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
I'll move up
 
07:23:26.150 --> 07:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to say while the
 
07:23:27.770 --> 07:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
hearing is still going and before I ask
 
07:23:30.048 --> 07:23:30.058 align:start position:0%
my question of Miss Kroll since people
 
07:23:32.330 --> 07:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
have not seen or everyone doesn't have
 
07:23:34.548 --> 07:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
the amendment the two changes that I'm
 
07:23:37.070 --> 07:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
reading here which are B and C
 
07:23:40.070 --> 07:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
letter B says providers of electricity
 
07:23:42.350 --> 07:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
shall not be subject to compliance under
 
07:23:42.360 --> 07:23:43.810 align:start position:0%
shall not be subject to compliance under
RSA

07:23:43.810 --> 07:23:43.820 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
07:23:47.150 --> 07:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
362-ath colon 3 for electricity sales
 
07:23:49.610 --> 07:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
that have been Exempted pursuant to
 
07:23:50.810 --> 07:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
paragraph a
 
07:23:50.820 --> 07:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
paragraph a
so

07:23:52.070 --> 07:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:23:54.170 --> 07:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
um providers of electricity that is get
 
07:23:55.968 --> 07:23:55.978 align:start position:0%
the exemption and then it and then C
 
07:23:58.548 --> 07:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
says all competitive electricity
 
07:24:02.448 --> 07:24:02.458 align:start position:0%
suppliers Shell One negotiate with any
 
07:24:04.610 --> 07:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
service political subdivision or state
 
07:24:06.770 --> 07:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
agency a contract that provides a rate
 
07:24:10.730 --> 07:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
that excludes costs of compliance with
 
07:24:12.770 --> 07:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard under
 
07:24:12.780 --> 07:24:14.288 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard under
RSA

07:24:14.288 --> 07:24:14.298 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
07:24:17.510 --> 07:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
362--f so it's doing multiple things
 
07:24:19.610 --> 07:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
here it's not just giving freedom to
 
07:24:22.610 --> 07:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
towns in my estimation so I'm wondering
 
07:24:24.590 --> 07:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
Miss crawl if you could comment since
 
07:24:26.930 --> 07:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
you're now hearing that that you
 
07:24:28.968 --> 07:24:28.978 align:start position:0%
mentioned the stability of the rec
 
07:24:32.690 --> 07:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
Market the stability of the business of
 
07:24:35.990 --> 07:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
energy I guess for the small energy
 
07:24:39.048 --> 07:24:39.058 align:start position:0%
producers could you comment on that
 
07:24:40.910 --> 07:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
um the fact that it's going to require
 
07:24:43.390 --> 07:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to say that electric
 
07:24:46.810 --> 07:24:46.820 align:start position:0%
providers will not be subject to
 
07:24:48.890 --> 07:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
compliance anymore
 
07:24:52.548 --> 07:24:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:54.708 --> 07:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
and then
 
07:24:58.250 --> 07:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh competitive electric electricity
 
07:25:00.350 --> 07:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
suppliers which is usually what we call
 
07:25:02.150 --> 07:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
the smaller people that are contributing
 
07:25:02.160 --> 07:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
the smaller people that are contributing
right

07:25:04.070 --> 07:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:25:06.288 --> 07:25:06.298 align:start position:0%
um they will also be
 
07:25:06.298 --> 07:25:08.390 align:start position:0%
um they will also be
excluded

07:25:08.390 --> 07:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
07:25:11.090 --> 07:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
they'll have to negotiate contracts that
 
07:25:13.010 --> 07:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
no longer include
 
07:25:16.548 --> 07:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
those charges so it's basically it is
 
07:25:18.708 --> 07:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
undermining the program completely so
 
07:25:21.590 --> 07:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
people need to understand that
 
07:25:24.770 --> 07:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
yeah so thank you for for reading that
 
07:25:26.510 --> 07:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
um to me representative
 
07:25:29.990 --> 07:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah so it sound so the percentages
 
07:25:32.690 --> 07:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
uh the percentage requirements in the
 
07:25:35.570 --> 07:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
RPS for example in class four the 1.5
 
07:25:35.580 --> 07:25:37.968 align:start position:0%
RPS for example in class four the 1.5
percent

07:25:37.968 --> 07:25:37.978 align:start position:0%
percent
 
07:25:41.990 --> 07:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
um is kind of keys off of whatever the
 
07:25:43.850 --> 07:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
sales are
 
07:25:45.650 --> 07:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
um and of course you know sales go up
 
07:25:48.830 --> 07:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
and sales go down depending on a variety
 
07:25:52.430 --> 07:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
of factors uh whether the economy Energy
 
07:25:52.440 --> 07:25:54.468 align:start position:0%
of factors uh whether the economy Energy
Efficiency

07:25:54.468 --> 07:25:54.478 align:start position:0%
Efficiency
 
07:25:54.478 --> 07:25:55.128 align:start position:0%
Efficiency
um

07:25:55.128 --> 07:25:55.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:25:57.530 --> 07:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
you know usage patterns whether whether
 
07:25:59.750 --> 07:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's in a single office building
 
07:26:01.368 --> 07:26:01.378 align:start position:0%
or all spread out back at their homes
 
07:26:03.708 --> 07:26:03.718 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing so but at any rate um
 
07:26:06.770 --> 07:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this approach
 
07:26:11.750 --> 07:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
um is simply just taking a deduction off
 
07:26:13.788 --> 07:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
of the sales
 
07:26:16.788 --> 07:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
um so that
 
07:26:20.448 --> 07:26:20.458 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's appropriate for for
 
07:26:24.048 --> 07:26:24.058 align:start position:0%
you to be uh speculating and commenting
 
07:26:25.910 --> 07:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
on on an amendment that you haven't even
 
07:26:25.920 --> 07:26:27.410 align:start position:0%
on on an amendment that you haven't even
seen

07:26:27.410 --> 07:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
seen
 
07:26:29.390 --> 07:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
and we shouldn't be debating an
 
07:26:31.910 --> 07:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that is unapproved and
 
07:26:34.910 --> 07:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
unofficial at this point so I think
 
07:26:37.788 --> 07:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll end it right there and I see
 
07:26:40.670 --> 07:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
that we have no other questions so I
 
07:26:42.410 --> 07:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
want to thank you Ms Grove for your
 
07:26:44.330 --> 07:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
testimony today we have one more person
 
07:26:47.030 --> 07:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
who would like to testify here this
 
07:26:50.090 --> 07:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
afternoon and that's Madeleine Monroe
 
07:26:53.090 --> 07:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
I'm Madeline Monroe who represents clean
 
07:26:56.590 --> 07:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire Ms no you are
 
07:26:59.330 --> 07:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
authorized to present
 
07:27:01.910 --> 07:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vose and members of
 
07:27:02.810 --> 07:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
the committee for the opportunity to
 
07:27:04.910 --> 07:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill today clean energy
 
07:27:08.510 --> 07:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire opposes House Bill 614 and
 
07:27:10.670 --> 07:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
I also have not had the opportunity to
 
07:27:13.250 --> 07:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
see the amendment so I'll be uh speaking
 
07:27:15.708 --> 07:27:15.718 align:start position:0%
about the bill itself mostly but I'm
 
07:27:17.090 --> 07:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
looking forward to reviewing that
 
07:27:19.368 --> 07:27:19.378 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment
 
07:27:21.650 --> 07:27:21.660 align:start position:0%
um I will Echo everything that Ms Kroll
 
07:27:24.590 --> 07:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
has said so I won't provide uh duplicate
 
07:27:26.570 --> 07:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
information but the renewable portfolio
 
07:27:28.610 --> 07:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
standard is really New Hampshire's only
 
07:27:31.310 --> 07:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
policy that promotes renewable energy in
 
07:27:33.468 --> 07:27:33.478 align:start position:0%
the state to us making it a crucial
 
07:27:35.208 --> 07:27:35.218 align:start position:0%
policy for growing our clean tech
 
07:27:38.030 --> 07:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
economy creating uh new high-paying jobs
 
07:27:40.128 --> 07:27:40.138 align:start position:0%
increasing energy Independence and
 
07:27:42.948 --> 07:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
protecting the environment we really do
 
07:27:44.868 --> 07:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
feel that this bill would undermine the
 
07:27:47.690 --> 07:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard it sounds
 
07:27:50.150 --> 07:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
like with the amendment what we would be
 
07:27:52.968 --> 07:27:52.978 align:start position:0%
saying is that currently we're looking
 
07:27:56.150 --> 07:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
to have 25 percent of all the energy in
 
07:27:57.468 --> 07:27:57.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire come from renewable
 
07:28:00.530 --> 07:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
sources by 2025. now we'd be saying
 
07:28:03.468 --> 07:28:03.478 align:start position:0%
we're looking to have 25 percent of some
 
07:28:05.208 --> 07:28:05.218 align:start position:0%
of the energy in New Hampshire come from
 
07:28:06.948 --> 07:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
renewable sources but we're not going to
 
07:28:08.810 --> 07:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
count any of the energy that the state
 
07:28:11.750 --> 07:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
or any town or municipality uses so
 
07:28:14.330 --> 07:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
really that is reducing our renewable
 
07:28:17.090 --> 07:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
energy goals for the state
 
07:28:19.070 --> 07:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
um I also agree that it is a slippery
 
07:28:20.930 --> 07:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
slope once we start exempting certain
 
07:28:23.270 --> 07:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
customers certainly we expect that other
 
07:28:25.190 --> 07:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
customers will get in line and ask for
 
07:28:27.288 --> 07:28:27.298 align:start position:0%
an exemption further reducing our
 
07:28:29.930 --> 07:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
renewable energy goals I do think that
 
07:28:31.968 --> 07:28:31.978 align:start position:0%
representative partial actually had a
 
07:28:33.948 --> 07:28:33.958 align:start position:0%
very good argument that is a concern
 
07:28:37.670 --> 07:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
that we share that implementing this
 
07:28:40.548 --> 07:28:40.558 align:start position:0%
um in the utilities billing systems will
 
07:28:43.250 --> 07:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
be a significant cost we hear this from
 
07:28:46.010 --> 07:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
the utilities all the time the slightest
 
07:28:48.350 --> 07:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
change to their billing systems which is
 
07:28:50.868 --> 07:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
not state of the art costs millions of
 
07:28:53.390 --> 07:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
dollars so identifying every customer
 
07:28:55.310 --> 07:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's eligible every account that's
 
07:28:58.070 --> 07:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
eligible and identify and creating a new
 
07:29:00.708 --> 07:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
credit and added that to the bill and
 
07:29:03.830 --> 07:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
then if a town decides to opt out of the
 
07:29:07.310 --> 07:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
credit then adding the cost back onto
 
07:29:09.890 --> 07:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
those bills in those accounts is not
 
07:29:12.350 --> 07:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
going to be something that comes at no
 
07:29:15.770 --> 07:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
cost certainly and it does reduce fun it
 
07:29:17.150 --> 07:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
would reduce funding to the renewable
 
07:29:19.490 --> 07:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
energy fund which funds a lot of Grant
 
07:29:21.830 --> 07:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
and rebate programs finally the state
 
07:29:24.048 --> 07:29:24.058 align:start position:0%
and municipalities many of them
 
07:29:26.270 --> 07:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
participate in the renewable portfolio
 
07:29:28.910 --> 07:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
standard by obtaining rebates from the
 
07:29:32.090 --> 07:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund by selling Rex for
 
07:29:33.770 --> 07:29:33.780 align:start position:0%
the removable energy projects that they
 
07:29:36.890 --> 07:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
own so they are already participating in
 
07:29:38.570 --> 07:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
the program it's only fair that they pay
 
07:29:41.150 --> 07:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
into the program don't have to take any
 
07:29:41.160 --> 07:29:44.330 align:start position:0%
into the program don't have to take any
questions

07:29:44.330 --> 07:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:48.590 --> 07:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony Ms mono
 
07:29:50.270 --> 07:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
I see we have a question from
 
07:29:52.490 --> 07:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
07:29:55.128 --> 07:29:55.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh it sounds like
 
07:29:56.570 --> 07:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
from the information that you just
 
07:29:59.110 --> 07:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
finished at the end about how
 
07:30:01.730 --> 07:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
municipalities are currently using the
 
07:30:03.948 --> 07:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
RPS program that they might actually
 
07:30:08.150 --> 07:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
lose significant money from this
 
07:30:10.310 --> 07:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
from the funding being diminished is is
 
07:30:13.610 --> 07:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
that a correct assumption yes if we're
 
07:30:16.430 --> 07:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
talking about a hypothetical town that
 
07:30:19.070 --> 07:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
may have just you know approved a large
 
07:30:20.510 --> 07:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
solar array at their wastewater
 
07:30:22.430 --> 07:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
treatment plant for example they're
 
07:30:24.708 --> 07:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
planning on getting a rebate from the
 
07:30:29.030 --> 07:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
state the cni solar rebate probably the
 
07:30:30.830 --> 07:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
funding for that may not be available if
 
07:30:32.090 --> 07:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
there's reduced funding in the renewable
 
07:30:34.128 --> 07:30:34.138 align:start position:0%
energy fund and then they're in all
 
07:30:37.010 --> 07:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
likelihood have calculated into the
 
07:30:38.708 --> 07:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
economic payback of the project
 
07:30:40.368 --> 07:30:40.378 align:start position:0%
marketing the renewable energy
 
07:30:43.368 --> 07:30:43.378 align:start position:0%
certificates and so if there's a
 
07:30:45.048 --> 07:30:45.058 align:start position:0%
decrease in the obligations or decrease
 
07:30:48.110 --> 07:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
in demand for Rex the value of racks
 
07:30:51.170 --> 07:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
will go down and therefore their payback
 
07:30:52.788 --> 07:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
on their system will likely be much
 
07:30:55.788 --> 07:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
longer than they had anticipated
 
07:30:58.670 --> 07:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
which could end up costing the town more
 
07:31:00.468 --> 07:31:00.478 align:start position:0%
than they would be saving
 
07:31:03.788 --> 07:31:03.798 align:start position:0%
the cost of compliance is
 
07:31:06.948 --> 07:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
0.0061 dollars per kilowatt hours or a
 
07:31:09.230 --> 07:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
fraction of a cent per kilowatt hour
 
07:31:10.968 --> 07:31:10.978 align:start position:0%
according to the last renewable energy
 
07:31:14.030 --> 07:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
fund report from the Public Utilities
 
07:31:16.548 --> 07:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
Commission which came out October 1st
 
07:31:18.948 --> 07:31:18.958 align:start position:0%
and if you all have not seen it I'm
 
07:31:20.750 --> 07:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
happy to share that with you but it's on
 
07:31:23.448 --> 07:31:23.458 align:start position:0%
the commission's webpage
 
07:31:26.750 --> 07:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you we have any further questions
 
07:31:31.430 --> 07:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:33.288 --> 07:31:33.298 align:start position:0%
any questions from it within the room
 
07:31:33.298 --> 07:31:35.510 align:start position:0%
any questions from it within the room
here

07:31:35.510 --> 07:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:31:38.390 --> 07:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative partial you're
 
07:31:40.310 --> 07:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
07:31:42.170 --> 07:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
yes I'm not sure if you can answer this
 
07:31:44.810 --> 07:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
or not but I am uh earlier speaker spoke
 
07:31:47.330 --> 07:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
of the the economic impact
 
07:31:51.170 --> 07:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
of our local producers of uh
 
07:31:54.468 --> 07:31:54.478 align:start position:0%
water and hydro energy in that case
 
07:31:57.110 --> 07:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of what the economic
 
07:31:59.510 --> 07:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
impact of our local energy production is
 
07:32:02.330 --> 07:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
and what a loss of that impact would be
 
07:32:04.788 --> 07:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the state
 
07:32:07.310 --> 07:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
I don't have exact numbers
 
07:32:10.910 --> 07:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
um we before the pandemic had a jobs
 
07:32:12.948 --> 07:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
report that I'm also happy to share with
 
07:32:12.958 --> 07:32:13.850 align:start position:0%
report that I'm also happy to share with
you

07:32:13.850 --> 07:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:32:15.288 --> 07:32:15.298 align:start position:0%
um the renewable energy and Energy
 
07:32:17.930 --> 07:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
Efficiency sectors in New Hampshire are
 
07:32:20.090 --> 07:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
growing work before the pandemic we're
 
07:32:22.368 --> 07:32:22.378 align:start position:0%
growing rapidly much faster than the
 
07:32:24.468 --> 07:32:24.478 align:start position:0%
rest of the economy or other job sectors
 
07:32:26.750 --> 07:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
and they are it is extremely good
 
07:32:29.390 --> 07:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
employment and any of our energy
 
07:32:31.090 --> 07:32:31.100 align:start position:0%
spending that we can keep in state
 
07:32:33.350 --> 07:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
benefits our local economy we're
 
07:32:36.590 --> 07:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
reinvesting that in local businesses and
 
07:32:38.150 --> 07:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't have an exact number
 
07:32:40.730 --> 07:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
on on the effect on the whole economy
 
07:32:46.190 --> 07:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:49.310 --> 07:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up of Representative
 
07:32:50.930 --> 07:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
no but I would love to see that
 
07:32:52.128 --> 07:32:52.138 align:start position:0%
information if you could share it at
 
07:32:53.810 --> 07:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
some point I will be in contact with you
 
07:32:56.208 --> 07:32:56.218 align:start position:0%
thank you absolutely thank you
 
07:32:58.968 --> 07:32:58.978 align:start position:0%
thank you next I recognize
 
07:33:00.708 --> 07:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Pitts for a
 
07:33:03.468 --> 07:33:03.478 align:start position:0%
question it's just a quickie the
 
07:33:07.128 --> 07:33:07.138 align:start position:0%
this the municipally owned renewable
 
07:33:09.650 --> 07:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
energy projects
 
07:33:11.390 --> 07:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
will they
 
07:33:11.400 --> 07:33:12.468 align:start position:0%
will they
um

07:33:12.468 --> 07:33:12.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:33:14.690 --> 07:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
if they're exempt will they still be
 
07:33:18.530 --> 07:33:18.540 align:start position:0%
entitled to take money out of the fund
 
07:33:21.890 --> 07:33:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh according to this Bill yes nothing uh
 
07:33:23.150 --> 07:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
you know it tells them they don't have
 
07:33:25.128 --> 07:33:25.138 align:start position:0%
to pay in anymore but they can still get
 
07:33:26.930 --> 07:33:26.940 align:start position:0%
the rebates so it is a little bit like
 
07:33:28.430 --> 07:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative sansich was saying it
 
07:33:33.190 --> 07:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:37.670 --> 07:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative Kelly no
 
07:33:40.368 --> 07:33:40.378 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
07:33:40.378 --> 07:33:42.530 align:start position:0%
no thank you
that

07:33:42.530 --> 07:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:33:45.350 --> 07:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
appears to satisfy all the questions
 
07:33:48.530 --> 07:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
that the committee has so I thank you Ms
 
07:33:49.850 --> 07:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
minnow for your
 
07:33:52.730 --> 07:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you
 
07:33:55.910 --> 07:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak so
 
07:33:58.788 --> 07:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
um before closing this public hearing
 
07:34:00.770 --> 07:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
I will read to you the blue sheet
 
07:34:00.780 --> 07:34:03.468 align:start position:0%
I will read to you the blue sheet
information

07:34:03.468 --> 07:34:03.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:07.430 --> 07:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
which indicates that there were seven
 
07:34:10.128 --> 07:34:10.138 align:start position:0%
people in support of this legislation 29
 
07:34:13.310 --> 07:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
is opposed and one person neutral
 
07:34:16.128 --> 07:34:16.138 align:start position:0%
some of the notables who responded to
 
07:34:18.670 --> 07:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
this legislation were
 
07:34:21.530 --> 07:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
representative Jason Osborne of the
 
07:34:23.510 --> 07:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
house Republican office the House
 
07:34:25.030 --> 07:34:25.040 align:start position:0%

Representative Bob Greene
 
07:34:35.770 --> 07:34:35.780 align:start position:0%
who signed in and supported the bill
 
07:34:39.170 --> 07:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
representative John podacek who signed
 
07:34:41.030 --> 07:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
in to the support of the bill
 
07:34:43.548 --> 07:34:43.558 align:start position:0%
representative Jeffrey greeson who
 
07:34:46.610 --> 07:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
signed in in support of the bill
 
07:34:49.128 --> 07:34:49.138 align:start position:0%
representative Herschel Nunes who signed
 
07:34:52.490 --> 07:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
in in support of the bill and uh
 
07:34:55.430 --> 07:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative Jonathan Jonathan Smith
 
07:35:01.430 --> 07:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
who signed in as a supporter of the bill
 
07:35:04.930 --> 07:35:04.940 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other
 
07:35:07.730 --> 07:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
elected officials who oh yes there is
 
07:35:10.850 --> 07:35:10.860 align:start position:0%
one more Richard Littlefield
 
07:35:14.330 --> 07:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
signed in and then supporting the bill
 
07:35:14.340 --> 07:35:16.070 align:start position:0%
signed in and then supporting the bill
so

07:35:16.070 --> 07:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:35:18.468 --> 07:35:18.478 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other elected officials
 
07:35:20.270 --> 07:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
who were who signed in and supported the

what representative natter is recognized
 
07:41:03.170 --> 07:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
I second the motion
 
07:41:07.190 --> 07:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we
 
07:41:10.788 --> 07:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
fast judgment on House Bill 624 as ought
 
07:41:12.230 --> 07:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
07:41:14.930 --> 07:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion
 
07:41:16.730 --> 07:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman I'd like to speak on
 
07:41:18.170 --> 07:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
this please
 
07:41:20.930 --> 07:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah like I
 
07:41:22.490 --> 07:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
said earlier I'm the only person I
 
07:41:25.070 --> 07:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
believe maybe I'm wrong but as if served
 
07:41:27.288 --> 07:41:27.298 align:start position:0%
on site evaluation committee meetings uh
 
07:41:29.810 --> 07:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
hearings quite a few of them and I've
 
07:41:32.208 --> 07:41:32.218 align:start position:0%
seen that there's very very few of these
 
07:41:35.270 --> 07:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
things of uh declarative judgment so I
 
07:41:36.410 --> 07:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a big loss of
 
07:41:38.110 --> 07:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue there but there is a loss of
 
07:41:41.030 --> 07:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
frustration to the people because I mean
 
07:41:43.610 --> 07:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
I had people call me up on the effect on
 
07:41:45.048 --> 07:41:45.058 align:start position:0%
the one we've been talking about the
 
07:41:47.570 --> 07:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
interim win thing after I was no longer
 
07:41:49.070 --> 07:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
on the committee and all I could do was
 
07:41:50.990 --> 07:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
refer them back to the general counsel
 
07:41:53.628 --> 07:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
there is a council for the public
 
07:41:55.788 --> 07:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Attorney General but
 
07:41:57.708 --> 07:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
those people come and go too just like
 
07:41:59.628 --> 07:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee does so
 
07:42:02.448 --> 07:42:02.458 align:start position:0%
there's really not a good place where
 
07:42:04.910 --> 07:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
people can go and say now I don't like
 
07:42:06.830 --> 07:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
the service I'm getting here and I want
 
07:42:08.570 --> 07:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
to appeal it and they shouldn't have to
 
07:42:10.368 --> 07:42:10.378 align:start position:0%
pay ten thousand dollars or three
 
07:42:11.990 --> 07:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
thousand depending on the size of it to
 
07:42:14.868 --> 07:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
do that 250 is more than enough money so
 
07:42:17.208 --> 07:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
I hope we'll all get together on this
 
07:42:19.490 --> 07:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
one and vote Yes
 
07:42:24.230 --> 07:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:24.240 --> 07:42:27.770 align:start position:0%
 
representative

07:42:27.770 --> 07:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:27.780 --> 07:42:29.570 align:start position:0%
 
autism

07:42:29.570 --> 07:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
autism
 
07:42:32.570 --> 07:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
yes I have a question we discussed the
 
07:42:34.548 --> 07:42:34.558 align:start position:0%
possibility of an amendment that would
 
07:42:36.110 --> 07:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
make it clear that this was something
 
07:42:38.330 --> 07:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
that was being made available to the
 
07:42:41.090 --> 07:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
public not to businesses not to
 
07:42:43.910 --> 07:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
corporate entities I I propose that we
 
07:42:47.930 --> 07:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
put this motion off until a time when an
 
07:42:50.090 --> 07:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
amendment can be brought forward through
 
07:42:50.100 --> 07:42:52.070 align:start position:0%
amendment can be brought forward through
OLS

07:42:52.070 --> 07:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
OLS
 
07:42:54.350 --> 07:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
en it's emotions
 
07:42:57.230 --> 07:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that comment but that's
 
07:42:57.240 --> 07:43:01.270 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that comment but that's
uh

07:43:01.270 --> 07:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:03.070 --> 07:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
I would
 
07:43:06.910 --> 07:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion I'm sorry I can't hear you
 
07:43:12.708 --> 07:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:14.448 --> 07:43:14.458 align:start position:0%
let's see where was
 
07:43:18.890 --> 07:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh I would respond to you by saying that
 
07:43:21.350 --> 07:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
this is an early Bill and we've been
 
07:43:23.810 --> 07:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
instructed by the house leadership to
 
07:43:25.610 --> 07:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
get the early bills out as quickly as
 
07:43:28.310 --> 07:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
possible so if this bill needs an
 
07:43:28.320 --> 07:43:29.690 align:start position:0%
possible so if this bill needs an
amendment

07:43:29.690 --> 07:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:43:31.628 --> 07:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
I suggest that
 
07:43:34.910 --> 07:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
we suggest that the Senate
 
07:43:37.368 --> 07:43:37.378 align:start position:0%
amend it when it gets to the Senate
 
07:43:40.788 --> 07:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
should it get that far I don't need to
 
07:43:43.190 --> 07:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
to deal with that now that would simply
 
07:43:46.910 --> 07:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
delay the process and uh
 
07:43:49.430 --> 07:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're working with very tight schedules
 
07:43:52.490 --> 07:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
to get these early bills assigned to the
 
07:43:53.930 --> 07:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
second committee so they can be
 
07:43:55.910 --> 07:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
evaluated there
 
07:43:57.770 --> 07:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
and what second committee will this go
 
07:43:57.780 --> 07:43:59.750 align:start position:0%
and what second committee will this go
to

07:43:59.750 --> 07:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:44:01.850 --> 07:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
what will it be I think it'll be Finance
 
07:44:04.270 --> 07:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not 100 sure
 
07:44:09.170 --> 07:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
it's a dash FN on the end of the bill
 
07:44:11.090 --> 07:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it'll go anywhere else
 
07:44:12.830 --> 07:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
but Finance but I could be wrong about
 
07:44:12.840 --> 07:44:14.990 align:start position:0%
but Finance but I could be wrong about
that

07:44:14.990 --> 07:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:44:17.090 --> 07:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll be a second committee but I
 
07:44:19.010 --> 07:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
don't know which one
 
07:44:21.048 --> 07:44:21.058 align:start position:0%
this is just one more way that we're not
 
07:44:21.058 --> 07:44:25.070 align:start position:0%
this is just one more way that we're not
doing

07:44:25.070 --> 07:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:27.770 --> 07:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
unto it that's up to that's our
 
07:44:27.780 --> 07:44:30.890 align:start position:0%
unto it that's up to that's our
responsibility

07:44:30.890 --> 07:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:35.030 --> 07:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:37.850 --> 07:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you Mr chairman I just want
 
07:44:40.190 --> 07:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
to Echo what representative oxenham said
 
07:44:42.650 --> 07:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
I have to say in the beginning I was a
 
07:44:44.448 --> 07:44:44.458 align:start position:0%
little skeptical about this bill but I
 
07:44:46.788 --> 07:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
gotta say I've been won over by the
 
07:44:49.190 --> 07:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
arguments of having more access for the
 
07:44:51.350 --> 07:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
public uh and I agree with
 
07:44:53.030 --> 07:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington on this as
 
07:44:56.030 --> 07:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
well uh this is a real issue that we
 
07:44:58.670 --> 07:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
should deal with and it seems to me a
 
07:45:01.730 --> 07:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
minor change in this bill which says
 
07:45:04.990 --> 07:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
that 250 dollars is the fee for
 
07:45:07.610 --> 07:45:07.620 align:start position:0%
non-corporate and non-businesses that
 
07:45:10.128 --> 07:45:10.138 align:start position:0%
small change is easy enough to make it's
 
07:45:12.110 --> 07:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
not a big deal and I think we would have
 
07:45:15.530 --> 07:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:17.570 --> 07:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh comment
 
07:45:20.570 --> 07:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
Representative Vincent
 
07:45:23.270 --> 07:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chairman I have to
 
07:45:27.410 --> 07:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
agree I mean you know we the last two
 
07:45:29.868 --> 07:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
terms that I've served we have people
 
07:45:32.390 --> 07:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
Representatives that move things out
 
07:45:34.548 --> 07:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
that have been logical that have been
 
07:45:36.708 --> 07:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
thought about we've been able to leave
 
07:45:39.110 --> 07:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
the meeting and go do our own homework
 
07:45:42.650 --> 07:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
to find out you know this and that you
 
07:45:44.690 --> 07:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
know I just think that this is being
 
07:45:47.030 --> 07:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
rushed and not paying attention to
 
07:45:49.788 --> 07:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
detail doesn't make us as proficient as
 
07:45:51.830 --> 07:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
we should be
 
07:45:55.610 --> 07:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
um what else can I say I mean if there's
 
07:45:58.430 --> 07:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
a fee for ten thousand dollars there's
 
07:46:00.350 --> 07:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
something else that's hidden it just
 
07:46:03.048 --> 07:46:03.058 align:start position:0%
seems like if it's too good to be true
 
07:46:05.990 --> 07:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
it is I like I might be in for in favor
 
07:46:07.070 --> 07:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
of this
 
07:46:09.410 --> 07:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
or not but it would I would be able to
 
07:46:12.288 --> 07:46:12.298 align:start position:0%
go and find out more information which
 
07:46:14.810 --> 07:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
we've had in the past two terms I
 
07:46:16.548 --> 07:46:16.558 align:start position:0%
understand the virus I understand the
 
07:46:20.628 --> 07:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
pandemic I get it but to rush and to be
 
07:46:23.390 --> 07:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
not as proficient as the professionals
 
07:46:27.708 --> 07:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
that we are be voted in and hired to do
 
07:46:31.430 --> 07:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't do us or anybody any justice and
 
07:46:33.830 --> 07:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
I understand it I get it we all have
 
07:46:35.990 --> 07:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
would pull this way in that way
 
07:46:37.788 --> 07:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
but I just don't think we're doing our
 
07:46:39.770 --> 07:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
voters uh and the people of New
 
07:46:41.448 --> 07:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a Justice and I really
 
07:46:43.850 --> 07:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate you let me say that Mr
 
07:46:45.770 --> 07:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
 
07:46:47.270 --> 07:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative
 
07:46:49.670 --> 07:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
07:46:49.680 --> 07:46:52.310 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr
chairs

07:46:52.310 --> 07:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:54.650 --> 07:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
this is more of a simple real simpler
 
07:46:57.770 --> 07:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
bills we've had today and because it is
 
07:47:00.830 --> 07:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
a second committee middle I'm positive
 
07:47:04.250 --> 07:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
that we can suggest strongly that any
 
07:47:06.530 --> 07:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
minor tweet can be done in the second
 
07:47:10.968 --> 07:47:10.978 align:start position:0%
committee to move it on to the house if
 
07:47:12.948 --> 07:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
we do otherwise we would have to
 
07:47:15.948 --> 07:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
actually we would have actually vote to
 
07:47:19.368 --> 07:47:19.378 align:start position:0%
say no on this bill and then free
 
07:47:21.830 --> 07:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
execution amendment can come back it
 
07:47:24.430 --> 07:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
takes up more time and it'd be very
 
07:47:27.468 --> 07:47:27.478 align:start position:0%
risky and so my recommendation is that
 
07:47:29.628 --> 07:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
we proceed with the vote that we're in
 
07:47:31.968 --> 07:47:31.978 align:start position:0%
the voting mode and then we strongly
 
07:47:34.250 --> 07:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
recommend and provide the simple
 
07:47:37.788 --> 07:47:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:41.990 --> 07:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:45.530 --> 07:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Harrington
 
07:47:48.590 --> 07:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
yeah in deference to the chair and the
 
07:47:49.968 --> 07:47:49.978 align:start position:0%
vice chair I understand what they're up
 
07:47:51.830 --> 07:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
against here for scheduling and so forth
 
07:47:54.530 --> 07:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
but I will say to representative sawmich
 
07:47:56.868 --> 07:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
and representative oxenham that we take
 
07:47:58.730 --> 07:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
this to the Senate I will go with you
 
07:48:01.368 --> 07:48:01.378 align:start position:0%
and I will talk about the need to change
 
07:48:03.770 --> 07:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
this because the intent of this bill is
 
07:48:06.468 --> 07:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
only to protect the little guy it's not
 
07:48:07.910 --> 07:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
to protect the multi-million dollar
 
07:48:09.530 --> 07:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
corporate so they don't have to pay ten
 
07:48:11.208 --> 07:48:11.218 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars they get the money I
 
07:48:12.830 --> 07:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
will work with you to make sure it's
 
07:48:15.708 --> 07:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
clear that this is for individuals or or
 
07:48:18.650 --> 07:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
municipalities or small entities but not
 
07:48:20.810 --> 07:48:20.820 align:start position:0%
big companies and that's the best I can
 
07:48:20.820 --> 07:48:22.910 align:start position:0%
big companies and that's the best I can
do

07:48:22.910 --> 07:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
07:48:27.590 --> 07:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:29.930 --> 07:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
07:48:31.548 --> 07:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
um I'd like clarification on a question
 
07:48:35.390 --> 07:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
I took notes when chair person Martin
 
07:48:35.400 --> 07:48:36.830 align:start position:0%
I took notes when chair person Martin
was

07:48:36.830 --> 07:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
07:48:38.750 --> 07:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
um telling explaining to us how this
 
07:48:41.628 --> 07:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
would affect the situation with uh the
 
07:48:43.850 --> 07:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee and she
 
07:48:47.208 --> 07:48:47.218 align:start position:0%
specifically uh Drew my attention to a
 
07:48:50.388 --> 07:48:50.398 align:start position:0%
problem with going from the 10 000 that
 
07:48:52.910 --> 07:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
can that Representative Vincent was
 
07:48:54.530 --> 07:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
talking about being too good to be true
 
07:48:56.208 --> 07:48:56.218 align:start position:0%
if you could just cut it to 250 how
 
07:49:00.170 --> 07:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
great she said that um the specific uses
 
07:49:02.930 --> 07:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
of that money by Statute had to go into
 
07:49:07.788 --> 07:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
a fund that allowed operating costs uh
 
07:49:11.930 --> 07:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
for the SEC and those would be used to
 
07:49:13.968 --> 07:49:13.978 align:start position:0%
fund public members I'm assuming it's
 
07:49:16.128 --> 07:49:16.138 align:start position:0%
like for you know travel expenses or
 
07:49:17.810 --> 07:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing
 
07:49:19.910 --> 07:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and compensation to the Department of
 
07:49:23.090 --> 07:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
Justice so there were specific statutory
 
07:49:26.150 --> 07:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
expenses of the SEC that were provided
 
07:49:28.490 --> 07:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
for only by money that's in that fund
 
07:49:30.888 --> 07:49:30.898 align:start position:0%
and so even though there are not a lot
 
07:49:33.770 --> 07:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
of people paying that fund I think it
 
07:49:36.590 --> 07:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
was that large for a reason
 
07:49:40.190 --> 07:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with anyone's argument
 
07:49:43.250 --> 07:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
about uh having the public have access
 
07:49:45.048 --> 07:49:45.058 align:start position:0%
and having it be a lower fee for them
 
07:49:47.810 --> 07:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
but I think if it doesn't have that
 
07:49:50.048 --> 07:49:50.058 align:start position:0%
specificity in the bill and I understand
 
07:49:51.830 --> 07:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington saying he'll
 
07:49:53.208 --> 07:49:53.218 align:start position:0%
go over to Senate and help make sure we
 
07:49:55.730 --> 07:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
have that what we're doing is we're
 
07:49:57.708 --> 07:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
taking away monies that will have to be
 
07:49:59.090 --> 07:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
made up in the general funds because
 
07:50:02.388 --> 07:50:02.398 align:start position:0%
that's what her testimony told us so
 
07:50:05.208 --> 07:50:05.218 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to know if you heard
 
07:50:07.368 --> 07:50:07.378 align:start position:0%
that same thing that I heard that that
 
07:50:10.368 --> 07:50:10.378 align:start position:0%
by Statute that money is a is in a
 
07:50:12.230 --> 07:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund which would now basically
 
07:50:19.628 --> 07:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:22.070 --> 07:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
it sounds really good but I'm just
 
07:50:23.208 --> 07:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
wondering if we're paying enough
 
07:50:25.548 --> 07:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
attention to what we're doing and other
 
07:50:27.830 --> 07:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
people will make in that point as well
 
07:50:29.810 --> 07:50:29.820 align:start position:0%
so there are several other fees in
 
07:50:32.150 --> 07:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
statute who may have noticed that go to
 
07:50:34.788 --> 07:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
that same fund so there isn't going to
 
07:50:37.788 --> 07:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
be much impact uh by decreasing the
 
07:50:40.910 --> 07:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
funding of declaratory rulings so I
 
07:50:43.430 --> 07:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't worry about that
 
07:50:46.070 --> 07:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
Next Step would be let's see
 
07:50:49.070 --> 07:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly bits
 
07:50:49.080 --> 07:50:50.448 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly bits
oh

07:50:50.448 --> 07:50:50.458 align:start position:0%
oh
 
07:50:50.458 --> 07:50:51.230 align:start position:0%
oh
um

07:50:51.230 --> 07:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:50:54.170 --> 07:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
I had two questions one for the chair I
 
07:50:56.570 --> 07:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
got a flow chart that said every bill
 
07:50:58.490 --> 07:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
was due March 11th what is the early
 
07:51:02.868 --> 07:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:07.388 --> 07:51:07.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:11.570 --> 07:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:14.868 --> 07:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
flowchart March 11th what is the early
 
07:51:17.270 --> 07:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
reporting date for this bill February
 
07:51:17.280 --> 07:51:19.310 align:start position:0%
reporting date for this bill February
18.

07:51:19.310 --> 07:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
18.
 
07:51:20.930 --> 07:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
report on house Bills going to the
 
07:51:23.150 --> 07:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
second committees February 18th February
 
07:51:23.160 --> 07:51:24.830 align:start position:0%
second committees February 18th February
18th

07:51:24.830 --> 07:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
18th
 
07:51:28.250 --> 07:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
so my question to the chair would be
 
07:51:32.570 --> 07:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
we're meeting Monday 48 hours in four
 
07:51:32.580 --> 07:51:33.610 align:start position:0%
we're meeting Monday 48 hours in four
hours

07:51:33.610 --> 07:51:33.620 align:start position:0%
hours
 
07:51:38.330 --> 07:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
OLS could put through an amendment
 
07:51:40.910 --> 07:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
that would say this and by the end of
 
07:51:43.610 --> 07:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
our session on Monday we could have the
 
07:51:47.810 --> 07:51:47.820 align:start position:0%
amendment it would be not out of order
 
07:51:53.510 --> 07:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
to ask that the person who made the uh
 
07:51:55.490 --> 07:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
motion withdraw it and the second
 
07:51:58.850 --> 07:51:58.860 align:start position:0%
withdraw it till Monday afternoon so we
 
07:52:01.788 --> 07:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
could get that amendment that says you
 
07:52:04.430 --> 07:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
know for not for cooperation though to
 
07:52:06.770 --> 07:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
exempt corporations and like they can do
 
07:52:09.590 --> 07:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
that in five minutes on the computer
 
07:52:11.810 --> 07:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you get a paper
 
07:52:14.208 --> 07:52:14.218 align:start position:0%
official Amendment over but I think if
 
07:52:15.948 --> 07:52:15.958 align:start position:0%
they send it over
 
07:52:19.010 --> 07:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
by email it's official I don't know
 
07:52:22.310 --> 07:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:24.410 --> 07:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
and that's 48 hours
 
07:52:26.150 --> 07:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that idea uh
 
07:52:29.570 --> 07:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Fitz but uh I'm a
 
07:52:31.910 --> 07:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
little bit nervous about putting this
 
07:52:33.350 --> 07:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
off because
 
07:52:36.770 --> 07:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
if we try to put it off till next Monday
 
07:52:38.930 --> 07:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
that's February 1st if we couldn't get
 
07:52:40.368 --> 07:52:40.378 align:start position:0%
it done on that day then we'd have to
 
07:52:42.288 --> 07:52:42.298 align:start position:0%
put it off to the following Monday which
 
07:52:46.430 --> 07:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
would be February 8th and then uh
 
07:52:48.830 --> 07:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
then if we can't do it if for some
 
07:52:51.468 --> 07:52:51.478 align:start position:0%
reason we don't get it done that day it
 
07:52:53.690 --> 07:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
just seems to me it's cutting it too
 
07:52:56.388 --> 07:52:56.398 align:start position:0%
close so I think we'll do this now we
 
07:52:58.788 --> 07:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
have a strategy in place to add the
 
07:53:01.368 --> 07:53:01.378 align:start position:0%
additional language either in the second
 
07:53:04.190 --> 07:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
committee or in the Senate so I don't
 
07:53:07.490 --> 07:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
see any reason to hold up the process
 
07:53:11.030 --> 07:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
now just because of that small change
 
07:53:16.910 --> 07:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:18.830 --> 07:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
because everybody has had a chance to
 
07:53:23.448 --> 07:53:23.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:26.868 --> 07:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
since it is five minutes before five I
 
07:53:29.270 --> 07:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
think we should ask the clerk to call
 
07:53:31.910 --> 07:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:36.230 --> 07:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
on Bill 624 the motion ought to pass
 
07:53:36.240 --> 07:53:38.208 align:start position:0%
on Bill 624 the motion ought to pass
representative

07:53:38.208 --> 07:53:38.218 align:start position:0%

07:53:54.770 --> 07:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:03.830 --> 07:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:07.810 --> 07:54:07.820 align:start position:0%
it has to be on video to vote
 
07:54:14.810 --> 07:54:14.820 align:start position:0%

we don't know that anybody's in the room
 
07:57:19.128 --> 07:57:19.138 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire Supreme Court has answered
 
07:57:24.468 --> 07:57:24.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:29.090 --> 07:57:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:32.288 --> 07:57:32.298 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter either party
 
07:57:35.628 --> 07:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman it's a tie then it goes to
 
07:57:38.510 --> 07:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
the floor with no motion or no
 
07:57:50.830 --> 07:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:55.030 --> 07:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:56.930 --> 07:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
representative murder what was the final

vote the final vote is 10 10.
 
07:58:03.230 --> 07:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion uh
 
07:58:03.240 --> 07:58:11.230 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion uh
oh

07:58:11.230 --> 07:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:14.750 --> 07:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
the one time he's
 
07:58:14.760 --> 07:58:16.810 align:start position:0%
the one time he's
okay

07:58:16.810 --> 07:58:16.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:58:19.190 --> 07:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
get that phone and stop that thing
 
07:58:21.770 --> 07:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr chairman
 
07:58:28.910 --> 07:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:30.888 --> 07:58:30.898 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Harrington he's
 
07:58:32.150 --> 07:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
new to it again
 
07:58:37.430 --> 07:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:39.410 --> 07:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
I don't think he really wanted to speak
 
07:58:48.250 --> 07:58:48.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:51.170 --> 07:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
no I I think Mr chairman we've had a
 
07:58:55.570 --> 07:58:55.580 align:start position:0%
vote and it's 10 to 10. uh
 
07:58:58.850 --> 07:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
seems like we need to uh
 
07:59:01.368 --> 07:59:01.378 align:start position:0%
keep it at that but we'd like to I think
 
07:59:03.410 --> 07:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
most of our members would like to see
 
07:59:06.288 --> 07:59:06.298 align:start position:0%
that Amendment and could support it
 
07:59:09.708 --> 07:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:12.110 --> 07:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
well we need the minority and a majority
 
07:59:12.120 --> 07:59:15.708 align:start position:0%
well we need the minority and a majority
report

07:59:15.708 --> 07:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:18.350 --> 07:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
so if we did a floor Amendment on the
 
07:59:20.930 --> 07:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
house floor would uh the members of this
 
07:59:22.430 --> 07:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
committee support it
 
07:59:26.090 --> 07:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
yes I think that would be a great idea
 
07:59:30.170 --> 07:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
yes going before the next session yeah
 
07:59:32.330 --> 07:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
this will go to the floor with no
 
07:59:35.810 --> 07:59:35.820 align:start position:0%
recommendation so I need a report from
 
07:59:39.590 --> 07:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh the yes side and the no side
 
07:59:42.170 --> 07:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:59:42.180 --> 07:59:44.090 align:start position:0%
and uh
representative

07:59:44.090 --> 07:59:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:59:47.750 --> 07:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
I just uh texted uh Paul Smith our clerk
 
07:59:50.690 --> 07:59:50.700 align:start position:0%
I asked if I told him we had a retinas
 
07:59:51.830 --> 07:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
07:59:54.170 --> 07:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
we don't know why technical difficulties
 
07:59:56.270 --> 07:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
or whatever and can we vote again he
 
07:59:58.010 --> 07:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
said yes if you adopt the motion to
 
08:00:00.350 --> 08:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
reconsider and the bill hasn't been
 
08:00:02.570 --> 08:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
transmitted to this office and that's by
 
08:00:05.388 --> 08:00:05.398 align:start position:0%
two-thirds right
 
08:00:05.398 --> 08:00:06.468 align:start position:0%
two-thirds right
um

08:00:06.468 --> 08:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:00:08.868 --> 08:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
all right let me ask I don't think so I
 
08:00:12.468 --> 08:00:12.478 align:start position:0%
think something I think so I'll ask him
 
08:00:14.810 --> 08:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
he's he's there
 
08:00:17.628 --> 08:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
do we have Mike Harrington back
 
08:00:19.690 --> 08:00:19.700 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve made any
 
08:00:22.490 --> 08:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
explanation that there's a difficulty I
 
08:00:25.128 --> 08:00:25.138 align:start position:0%
he might have just not been in the room
 
08:00:29.810 --> 08:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
in which case the vote is the vote no
 
08:00:33.350 --> 08:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
um Paul says majority but
 
08:00:35.810 --> 08:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
Paul said in answer to a question about
 
08:00:38.270 --> 08:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
technical difficulties we don't know
 
08:00:40.610 --> 08:00:40.620 align:start position:0%
that there were technical difficulties
 
08:00:44.530 --> 08:00:44.540 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:47.270 --> 08:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
no no he I asked him if we could
 
08:00:50.868 --> 08:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
reconsider the vote and vote again
 
08:00:52.670 --> 08:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
and he said yes
 
08:00:55.610 --> 08:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
by majority okay that's uh immaterial
 
08:00:57.590 --> 08:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
because we've just been in communication
 
08:00:59.750 --> 08:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
with Mr Harrington and he said he left
 
08:01:03.708 --> 08:01:03.718 align:start position:0%
the room okay so the vote is valid at 10
 
08:01:05.930 --> 08:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
to 10. we will go to the house floor
 
08:01:08.208 --> 08:01:08.218 align:start position:0%
with no recommendation
 
08:01:11.350 --> 08:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
we need a report from each side
 
08:01:13.788 --> 08:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
supporting your
 
08:01:17.090 --> 08:01:17.100 align:start position:0%
your position on the bill and uh
 
08:01:19.850 --> 08:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
representative samsich and I will create
 
08:01:23.690 --> 08:01:23.700 align:start position:0%

08:01:51.708 --> 08:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:53.448 --> 08:01:53.458 align:start position:0%

report from me on this bill or I mean
 
08:02:03.410 --> 08:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
somebody from your side
 
08:02:06.170 --> 08:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
well I can do that if if that's what you
 
08:02:06.180 --> 08:02:07.010 align:start position:0%
well I can do that if if that's what you
want

08:02:07.010 --> 08:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
want
 
08:02:09.530 --> 08:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
right there has to be a report in the
 
08:02:12.110 --> 08:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
house calendar so please write
 
08:02:12.120 --> 08:02:13.430 align:start position:0%
house calendar so please write
everything

08:02:13.430 --> 08:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
everything
 
08:02:17.448 --> 08:02:17.458 align:start position:0%
is a minority Minority Report is
 
08:02:19.670 --> 08:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
identical to the majority report in this
 
08:02:19.680 --> 08:02:20.570 align:start position:0%
identical to the majority report in this
case

08:02:20.570 --> 08:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
case
 
08:02:22.788 --> 08:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
because there is no minority it was a 10
 
08:02:24.708 --> 08:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
to 10 vote
 
08:02:28.670 --> 08:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
or you just won things
 
08:02:30.110 --> 08:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
I think the house clerk is going to
 
08:02:37.690 --> 08:02:37.700 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:41.810 --> 08:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
a report saying that we we would like to
 
08:02:48.110 --> 08:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:48.120 --> 08:02:49.548 align:start position:0%
 
okay

08:02:49.548 --> 08:02:49.558 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:02:53.150 --> 08:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:53.160 --> 08:02:54.350 align:start position:0%
 
sure

08:02:54.350 --> 08:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
sure
 
08:02:57.048 --> 08:02:57.058 align:start position:0%
if memory serves and I don't know if the
 
08:02:58.788 --> 08:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
researcher is on here because what
 
08:03:00.888 --> 08:03:00.898 align:start position:0%
they're saying this but I think there
 
08:03:02.868 --> 08:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
was one case last year where there was a
 
08:03:05.208 --> 08:03:05.218 align:start position:0%
no recommendation and I think they just
 
08:03:06.948 --> 08:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
came with general report because they're
 
08:03:10.190 --> 08:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
not it's not a major minor
 
08:03:13.510 --> 08:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yes
 
08:03:15.530 --> 08:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
representative matter
 
08:03:18.468 --> 08:03:18.478 align:start position:0%
as I recall it's um the ought to pass
 
08:03:20.810 --> 08:03:20.820 align:start position:0%
motion goes first and then the itl
 
08:03:24.310 --> 08:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:27.468 --> 08:03:27.478 align:start position:0%
Bill comes out without recommendation at
 
08:03:29.868 --> 08:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:32.628 --> 08:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
check with Paul
 
08:03:35.208 --> 08:03:35.218 align:start position:0%
correct right here you're right
 
08:03:37.010 --> 08:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll work that out with
 
08:03:40.490 --> 08:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative samsich and we'll work
 
08:03:44.150 --> 08:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
with the clerk to get the appropriate
 
08:03:46.670 --> 08:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
Port into the calendar at the
 
08:03:50.270 --> 08:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate time so
 
08:03:53.510 --> 08:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
I would like to uh thank uh everybody
 
08:03:56.208 --> 08:03:56.218 align:start position:0%

08:03:58.010 --> 08:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
