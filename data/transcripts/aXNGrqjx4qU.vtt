passed out of the senate
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
and you might take a look at the
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
really leadership from both sides of the
 
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.750 align:start position:0%
really leadership from both sides of the
aisle

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
aisle
 
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.870 align:start position:0%
aisle
in

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.670 align:start position:0%
 
we've

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of testimony in the past
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
from from families
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
of children with special needs
 
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.829 align:start position:0%
of children with special needs
clearly

00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
clearly there is a need
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
i think just by the fact that we heard
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's um roughly 30 34 complaints
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
annually to the department of education
 
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.430 align:start position:0%
annually to the department of education
um

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
in itself is a problem i i think that
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
points out a problem um in terms of um
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
their concerns about
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.030 align:start position:0%
the process
this

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
this bill was an outgrowth of uh
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
study committee last fall
 
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.110 align:start position:0%
study committee last fall
um

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.150 align:start position:0%
um
really

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
as a result of the testimony
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
people got together and said we need to
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
do something
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
we've we've heard
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
in testimony
 
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.310 align:start position:0%
in testimony
that

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that it's not
 
00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:42.870 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that it's not
functioning

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
i i would disagree with that from
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
listening to the parents
 
00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:49.190 align:start position:0%

i sent out this
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
doe survey from last spring which i
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
think certainly points out the problems
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
the school explains what options parents
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
have if they disagree with the decision
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
of the school
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
35 percent of parents did not agree with
 
00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.350 align:start position:0%
35 percent of parents did not agree with
that

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.710 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
it goes on and on
 
00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:19.829 align:start position:0%
it goes on and on
um

00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of others i wanted to mention
 
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.030 align:start position:0%
a couple of others i wanted to mention

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.269 align:start position:0%
child prior to the iep meeting
17

00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
17
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
i was given information about the
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
research that supports the instructional
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
52 percent said they were not
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
they're clearly
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
clearly problems and i think that the
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is to address um
 
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.389 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is to address um
those

00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
those areas um
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
we heard from the
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.150 align:start position:0%

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
and uh discussion about whether it
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
should be under um
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
her office um
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that it be a
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
separate office i i think the um the
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
offices it's structured now
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
is clearly um
 
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.590 align:start position:0%
is clearly um
given

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.949 align:start position:0%
given
more

00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility in the areas of juvenile
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
justice and dcyf and i think it would be
 
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.949 align:start position:0%
justice and dcyf and i think it would be
a

00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
a problem to mix in special uh knee
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
children with those areas
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
and i i think that
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
there was a conference i went to a
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago and former uh
 
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
governor from florida jeb bush
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
um said
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
be bold be impatient
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
and i i took that being patient these
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
kids are only young once
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
we have to do something for them look at
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
the proficiency scores of children with
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
special needs look at the survey results
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
we need to we need to act it's on us
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
right now and for those reasons i ask
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
you to support the ought to pass motion
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion from the
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
maker of the second
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
no thank you mr chair i think
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli covered it quite
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative porter
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
i support the idea of the advocate i
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
think it's great i'm wondering why it is
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
two things
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
why it is we would not want to
 
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.150 align:start position:0%
why it is we would not want to
have

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
this advocate attached to the child
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
advocacy office
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
given that the child
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
they already might have have contact
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
with some of these families for
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
different reasons it seems to be more
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
unifying and that is also an independent
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
agency not um overseen by the department
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
of education or any school district so i
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
i took to heart what they had to say
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
and the second ish point that i have or
 
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
was wondering
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
exactly what power
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
does this
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
advocate have
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
to fix a problem for a family i i wasn't
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
clear during the hearing
 
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.990 align:start position:0%
clear during the hearing
what

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
they would be able to do if a family
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
came if they worked with a family
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
and i would like to have that clarified
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
if someone can do that for me
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
so anybody would like to respond to
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative porter's question on the
 
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.829 align:start position:0%
representative porter's question on the
committee

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.629 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
ideally i would like to see them have a
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
little bit more teeth but that's not in
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
the bill that we are presented with um
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
a great part of their responsibility is
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
information and supporting of parents
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
with children of uh special needs
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
but also um identifying where the
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
problems um exist in the process um and
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
getting back to the legislature and
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
others as specified in the bill
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
something that i think after the office
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
gets up and operational we can look at
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
and see
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
what additional can be done
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure that they will also be
 
00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:41.030 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure that they will also be
working

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
with the department who
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
might have
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh but i'm not sure how that has
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's a follow-up question
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm also curious as to you know
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
you see when it gets started up
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
this is a new agency then a new office
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
that's going to have to start up from
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
how long will it take for it to become
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
fully functional as opposed to attached
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
being attached to an
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
office that is already fully functional
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
and making this be an additional service
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
that they provide
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering what kind of kind of
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
time frame you think
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
it will be
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
before this independent office set up
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
under this bill will be
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
actually effective
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative cornelli
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
in either case
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
hiring of staff with expertise is going
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
to have to be a a primary
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
function of the startup
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that that
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
plays into one one option or the other
 
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.470 align:start position:0%
plays into one one option or the other
um

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
but in terms of uh
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
hiring of staff and so forth uh you know
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
go through the the governor and the
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
executive council and uh
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
um you know i
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
dare not speculate on how long that
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
might take
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure that if this bill
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
passes and gets signed i i think that
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
pressure exerted from special ed
 
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.029 align:start position:0%
pressure exerted from special ed
parents

00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
to the governor to uh get the
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
office up and running as quickly as
 
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.430 align:start position:0%
office up and running as quickly as
possible

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
rep san luna
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
and then representative boehm thank you
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
very much mr chair um
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli asks us to be
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
impatient well you know taxpayers across
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
are impatient
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
as well and they're waiting for proper
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
school funding
 
00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:53.909 align:start position:0%
school funding
and

00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
this legislature has done
 
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.750 align:start position:0%
this legislature has done
nothing

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
to to help move that forward
 
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.710 align:start position:0%
to to help move that forward
um

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
proper school funding would address a
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
lot of the issues that representative
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
cordelli talked about because some
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
districts can afford to provide an
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
on the backs of their property taxpayers
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
and others can't this legislature has
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
taken steps hang on i'm getting here
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
has taken steps with vouchers with
 
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.789 align:start position:0%
has taken steps with vouchers with
prendapods

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
prendapods
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
and frankly we saw a bill that actually
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
sought to dumb down the curriculum
 
00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.470 align:start position:0%
sought to dumb down the curriculum
and

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.270 align:start position:0%
and
and

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
those clearly
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
don't do anything
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
to to address what representative
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
cordelia is talking about here i happen
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
to agree completely with representative
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
porter that that
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
that an office of a special education
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
advocate or special education advocate
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
is a good idea but that it should reside
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
in the office of the child advocate
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
and we've we've got we've received
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
testimony from the prior director of
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
that office as well as the new director
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
from from that office
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
listing all of the reasons why it should
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
be there
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
presenting a plan for for doing it tied
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
in with the next state budget
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
and furthermore uh how it would would
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
improve their ability um within the
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
scope that they that they have right now
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
their expanded scope that they have
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
right now which includes education to be
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
able to meet children's needs in a
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
variety of different ways
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
so a special education advocate under
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate would
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
would would not only be be more
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
economical from a statewide
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
basis but
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
but it would also i think provide a more
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
comprehensive way of
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
meeting students needs across the state
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
so so i support the idea but i oppose
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
the bill as instruction
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
the office of child advocate now is
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
mainly dealing with dcys
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
abusive parents
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
abusive kids that are abused and whatnot
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
so i think it's probably better to be a
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
separate also from what i've heard from
 
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.870 align:start position:0%
separate also from what i've heard from
parents

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
in one case i know of where a parent
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
in my town
 
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.630 align:start position:0%
in my town
said

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.669 align:start position:0%
said
my

00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
child isn't being treated right for a
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh and i called
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
u.s senator's office and they said talk
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's good parents do not know where to
 
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.070 align:start position:0%
it's good parents do not know where to
go

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
and i think the problem i said well
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
contact the doe because they have an
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
office for that now this i would hope
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
what this does with the office of child
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
advocate for special ed
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
they let everybody know that they exist
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
the special ed organizations and whatnot
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
so parents know who to call if they are
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
having problems in their school district
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
and i think by going to the regular
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
child advocate office they have enough
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
on their hands i was on hhs yesterday
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
they have enough on their hands with
 
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.070 align:start position:0%
they have enough on their hands with
handling

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
handling
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
child abuse and those kind of issues and
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
and uh without being this added to them
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
adding this to their office is still not
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
going to take any more
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
less time than the office getting up to
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
speed because they have to hire people
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
just for the special ad and where to go
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
and whatnot so and it's all under the
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
same head administrative services so i
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to be more or
 
00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:36.070 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to be more or
less

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
time-consuming for the office getting up
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
to speed thank you thank you further
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
so

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
just for a point of clarification um i
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
also sat on the house bill 581 study
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee that representative cordelli
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh has referenced and representative
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
ladd as well um
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
a couple of things one that
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
study committee the the
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
request for a performance audit of
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
special education services was the
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
primary recommendation of that study
 
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.669 align:start position:0%
primary recommendation of that study
committee

00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
and my concern is that
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
we're establishing an office without
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
knowing what we need
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
i i i feel like it's a little bit
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
putting the cart before the horse
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
in my own mind coming out of that
 
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.310 align:start position:0%
in my own mind coming out of that
committee

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
what i saw the process looking like was
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
that we were going to order a
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
performance audit
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
get the results of that performance
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
audit and then
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
take a look at what needed to be done
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
to me it looks like we're
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend 500 000 on an
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
office and we don't know what the task
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
of that office is going to be
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that the reference to
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
the advocate for special education in
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
the report from that committee
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
indicates that the advocate will be the
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
authority in disputes
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
and i don't see that reflected in the
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
bill i don't see any sort of
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
authority if you will given to the
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
office of the special education advocate
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if that was just an
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
oversight or uh
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not we can anticipate that
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
there are going to have to be changes to
 
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.870 align:start position:0%
there are going to have to be changes to
that

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
further further discussion
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
careful with that daisy chain over there
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman ladd um
 
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.669 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman ladd um
i

00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
as odd as it may seem i do not agree
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
with my fellow democrats on this
 
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.630 align:start position:0%
with my fellow democrats on this
committee

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
um i do not think this office is useful
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
uh i think we've done a really poor job
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
in filling vacancies in the department
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
of education i think the special
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
education department is severely over
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
taxed over there
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
i listen to representative cordelie talk
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
about 35 percent of the parents unhappy
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
that means 65 percent are or are
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
satisfied statistics only life and make
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
them lie that way you can turn them any
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
way you want
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
the other part is the special education
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
program already has an operation to go
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
there to do what they can settle working
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
with parents
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
you create this office there is not one
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
thing in this bill to give them any
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
authority to change any iep zero parents
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
not complain about the spread process
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
they complain about the iep and what the
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
children get and don't get and i agree
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
with that the best advocates for any
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
youngster in the world is the parent and
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank god we have something to do that
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
all the time that's the best one you can
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
have for grandparents you need someone
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
to advocate but when they go in there
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
and they're frustrated all we're doing
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
is creating a larger base of more
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
frustrated parents because this person
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
cannot do anything to help that iep
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
cannot i can't get this service i can't
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
get that service there's nothing in here
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
that gives this person anything it's a
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
half a million dollar election year
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
waste of money i see the bipartisanship
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that i appreciate the
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
concept if we fund education as
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative talked about the way it
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
should be this may not be a big issue if
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
we have deal how many spaces in doe are
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
not filled right now haven't been filled
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
for the last three four years under our
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner there's a lot maybe if we
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
start funding those and filling those we
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
won't have these issues but this piece
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
does nothing to help speculate parents
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
except make them more frustrated in my
 
00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:31.990 align:start position:0%
except make them more frustrated in my
belief

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
belief
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you further
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
discussion represent cornell
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
i agree with what everyone has just said
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
but i also want to i'm looking at the
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal note in the back and it said the
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
department of education states will be
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
no impact on their budget however the
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
new monitoring requirements for schools
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
could result in an indeterminable impact
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
on local expenditures so this is another
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
way of passing the buck down to local
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and i won't vote for that at
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
all it's bad enough
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ellison
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh just to to to follow up uh from what
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
my friend to my right just said i think
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
that this is a a waste of money the
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
money is not well spent
 
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh jeb bush may have said be bold but
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is not a bold bill it is not
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
it does nothing to help the people that
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
need to be helped and i speak
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of things need to
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
be done and representative cordelli said
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
we need to do something
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
well quite often in this committee we
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
talk about we need to do something and
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
then the final result that we get is
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
something that didn't do anything but we
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
feel good about it because we had a bill
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
and we've got a name on it and therefore
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
we took some action on that this is this
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
is uh this is a false promise
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
to special ed parents
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it will be seen
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
that's what it is
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
certainly in its current form uh i'll be
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
voting against it
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative tanner
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i too agree about the
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
school funding that that's our should
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
have been our number one focus this year
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
and wasn't
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
but uh besides that i think that this um
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
this position adds another level of
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy again just to frustrate
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
parents because it has no teeth
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
we have we have a system in the
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
department of education with specialists
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
in special education we have a complaint
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh part of special education why aren't
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
we taking some of this money and just
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
beefing up
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
what's already in the department of
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
education um
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
we heard that yes there were
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
30 to 40 uh complaints and we were asked
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
how many resolved about half of them a
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
little over half of them get resolved
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
through the department of education
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
and the other half we really didn't get
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
an idea
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
of what happens to those parents uh
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
whether they
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
were going on to a different area to to
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
look for uh results or not but
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
um special education is a tough thing
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's a tough thing i've sat in iep
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
meetings and
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
you know you have people there that
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
are trying everybody i think is trying
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
to do the best for the child and
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
obviously the parent knows the best way
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
for the child and what the child is like
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
at home
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
and the the school is trying to prepare
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
for a life outside of the school um so
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
everybody's working towards the same
 
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.549 align:start position:0%
everybody's working towards the same
results

00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i know
 
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
that i've seen the frustration with
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
parents and i feel for them
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
and i think it's um this is not going to
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
solve anything i think as
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
representative ellison and and woodcock
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
said this is just going to be one more
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
level of frustration for special ed
 
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.789 align:start position:0%
level of frustration for special ed
parents

00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
so i'll be voting against it thank you
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
on funding
 
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.549 align:start position:0%
on funding
um

00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
we've heard um

um of a
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
who worked for 14 months
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
to try and get services for their child
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
and finally had to homeschool their
 
00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:24.789 align:start position:0%
and finally had to homeschool their
child

00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
i've talked with an advocate who worked
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
with a family that went bankrupt went
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
bankrupt trying to get services and yet
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about more funding to
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
schools i'm talking about services to
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
kids thank you
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
i appreciate uh representative
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
cordelli's position
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
um i would like to actually ask them
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
then what services to kids is this
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
office going to be able to provide just
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
tell me one
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
one service that they're going to
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
actually be able to do
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
resident districts are responsible for
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
providing services
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
so your answer is may i
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you sir
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
so your answer is zero
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
the question there are no services
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
attached to this bill this bill does
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
nothing the person has no ability to do
 
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.750 align:start position:0%
nothing the person has no ability to do
anything

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
glenn i agree with you the special
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
parents are frustrated especially
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
teachers are frustrated school systems
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
are frustrated but this doesn't help
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
that and i'm not suggesting we don't
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
find it better or improve it anything we
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
can do but there is a process in place
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
if it's not effective let's improve the
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
process this isn't it this isn't it
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman further discussion
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative hobson
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
um i wanted to know if someone could
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
describe to me the uh petition that was
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
signed by 700 parents i have not seen
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
that petition
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
but it would seem to me that 700 parents
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
are pretty upset with the way things are
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
going right now can can someone talk to
 
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.350 align:start position:0%
going right now can can someone talk to
that

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
i could send out an email
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
and ask my 700 contacts to please sign
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
this petition and i would get 700
 
00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:09.830 align:start position:0%
this petition and i would get 700
signatures

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
signatures
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
so it depends on where the petition came
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
from who asked for it who was solicited
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
to answer it if it went out to the
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
general public in every school district
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
and 700 people around the state
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
answered that petition then i would say
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
it has a certain amount of weight but we
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
don't know who sent this petition out we
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
don't know who it was sent to
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
and if there are 35 000 or 30 000
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
special education students within the
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
state receiving services
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
it would not be difficult to find 700
 
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.389 align:start position:0%
it would not be difficult to find 700
people

00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
in one organization that deals only with
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
disputes with special education so i i
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
as much as i appreciate petitions
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
we see them all the time
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i and i question the validity of the
 
00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.590 align:start position:0%
and i and i question the validity of the
petitions

00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this bill
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:06.549 align:start position:0%
this committee
this

00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
year got over a hundred bills
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
and many of those bills as we like to
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
put it were not ready for prime time a
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
lot of them weren't ready for day time
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
or night time or anytime
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
i see it a little bit differently
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
i try to as i look at these things that
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
come to us from the senate is something
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
that passes the senate i assume is
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's been some due diligence on the
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
part of the senators i noticed that some
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
of the it's a bipartisan bill uh senator
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
rosenwald is a co-sponsor senator
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
sherman is a co-sponsor
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
so again my point is as i look at these
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
things i i think i try to get i try to
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
give every bill
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
full consideration but something that
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
the senate has spent a lot of time on
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
and has given us i want to honor their
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
work and and give it um
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
as much
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
as much discretion as i can um
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
and honor their their work as well as
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's my point
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative lekkis
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
it seems that this advocate
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
the job is not to make the changes the
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
job seems to be to do all of the
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
work at investigating
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
we've given them authority to look at
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
the documents from the schools
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things you know all the
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
things that the parents would come to
 
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.869 align:start position:0%
things that the parents would come to
investigate

00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
they can't do anything about it
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
but the doe can
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
and so if they then pass off all their
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
findings to the doe
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
the doe has the authority to then follow
 
00:34:48.399 --> 00:34:49.750 align:start position:0%
the doe has the authority to then follow
up

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so um yes
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go back to this concept of the
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
performance audit
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
in process a performance audit of
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
special education in the state of new
 
00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:14.470 align:start position:0%
special education in the state of new
hampshire

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
that performance audit is in fact the
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
investigation of how the system works or
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't work in whatever way shape or
 
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.470 align:start position:0%
doesn't work in whatever way shape or
form

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why we're putting together
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
a parallel process
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
when we don't have the results back from
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
the original performance audit
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that that performance audit
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
will reveal areas for improvement
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
but what if the performance audit comes
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
back and they say well you know what the
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
big problem is
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
the big problem is uh they're completely
 
00:35:53.359 --> 00:35:55.910 align:start position:0%
the big problem is uh they're completely
understaffed

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
understaffed
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
we've spent five hundred thousand
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
dollars on the office of the advocate
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
to deal with a problem that the
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
performance audit has said is a staffing
 
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.670 align:start position:0%
performance audit has said is a staffing
issue

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.550 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
that there's no benefit to special
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
education parents to the parallel
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
process going on what we need to do
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
is figure out what the problem is the
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
performance audit
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
and then address the limitations or the
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
weak areas that are revealed in the
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
performance audit and
 
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.430 align:start position:0%
performance audit and
uh

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's not the authority of the advocate
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
for special education i look at the
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
advocates office as like the complaint
 
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.910 align:start position:0%
advocates office as like the complaint
department

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's like establishing a complaint
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
department separate from the department
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
of education
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
so i would ask the question you know why
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
are we undermining the department of
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
education why are we taking the legs out
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
from underneath them
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
before we even know
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
what they're
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
doing well and where they need
 
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.470 align:start position:0%
doing well and where they need
improvement

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's what the performance audit is for
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i thank you very much
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
i i think we all must agree that there
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
is a an issue here that needs resolution
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
and that uh i sat on that committee with
 
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
you representative mullen and
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and we heard
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
some awful things from parents who have
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
tried and tried and tried to get help in
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
fact even in this committee we've heard
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
from a parent who had the lawyer up
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
and within
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
four weeks the tutor was provided but
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
that individual had to lawyer up and of
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
course it's a real costly battle
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
we have kids in schools that are going
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
to be nine year olds nine years old once
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
in their life
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
we can't wait
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
as i see it right now for the
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
lba to come through with this
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
performance audit yes we need to have it
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
i welcome
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
and i would love to see those results
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
we're still in the top portion of that
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
trying to identify the scope of the
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
performance audit
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
so we could be looking at another year
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
year and a half two years before that is
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely done
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of a slow way to get down
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
around the corner
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm of the opinion that we need to
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
move on this and get something going
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
and i for one don't see the other
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
advocacy group doing this seeing that
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
they don't aren't prepared they
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
themselves in a letter to us
 
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.310 align:start position:0%
themselves in a letter to us
stated

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
stated
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
we also lack
 
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
the level of expertise that senate bill
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
381 represents in a new agency
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
so they have to gear up as well as well
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
as you know we'd have to gear up in
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
d.o.e to
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
support this endeavor
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm all for we i i don't want to kick
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
the can down the road any further and in
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
response to some of the things which we
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
have done here in terms of supporting
 
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
children in a state i think we're highly
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
in order and out saying we're not doing
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
anything we have done an awful lot
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of looking at adequacy and
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
looking at career technical education
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
and all the other avenues this year and
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
made some significant gains which i'm
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
very proud that we've made
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
i for one will support going forward
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
with this yes i believe that there are
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
issues even within this bill that we
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
need to work on
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
but that's another day we have this in
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
front of us now
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
and it's come to us with a a buy
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
parson support out of the senate
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
came out unanimously out of the senate
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
it comes out with
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
senators on both sides that are keenly
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
interested in education so
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
um we can talk this one into to death
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
here but uh
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the long run we need to act and we
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
cannot kick this can down the road a
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
little bit further we have parents out
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
there shouting for help
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative boom
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd just like to
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
make a comment
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
this looking at the responsibilities
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
that this job has
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
it could be a step to preventing
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
or stopping the parent from having to
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
get a lawyer to sue
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
and and the results of
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
what the advocate does
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
may help
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
the parent sue
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
so it's a good position because they're
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
not they're outside the doe
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
they're monitoring all the stuff that
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
you're advocating for the parent
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
for the child on what's needed they're
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
collecting all this information so
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
it could help
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
the parent from not having to get a
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
lawyer thank you thank you
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
represent luna
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so um
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
parents are shouting for help there's a
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
lot of people around the state that are
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
shouting for help taxpayers are shouting
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
for help
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
as well and um and
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
we've talked about it a lot
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
um uh and a little bit on this bill but
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
properly funding our schools is going to
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
go a long way to uh to helping to
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
address this problem i think we've all
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
been to uh to a lot of school board
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
meetings and a lot of school district
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
meetings and a lot of budget committee
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
meetings where um where a lot of people
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
come in and express concern
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
about special education costs
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
and so it's no wonder why there's
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
districts all across the state that are
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
very in tune with with controlling their
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
special education costs whether that
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
means hiring an attorney
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
for the district and uh and taking a a
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
an adversarial position when it or or or
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
a very careful position when uh when
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
when looking at a a student's potential
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
special education needs
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
and and so that clearly puts parents in
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
a position where they're going to be
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
frustrated but if we could properly fund
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
our schools and schools could could
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
rely on on attorneys to control um
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
their their special education costs but
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
instead make the right decisions uh
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
based on a student's needs then i think
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
we're doing the right things for the
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
students we're doing the right things
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
for the parents and doing something like
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
this and and i think it's very clear
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
that 381 doesn't have any teeth uh in
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
fact we don't even know where to put the
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
teeth because we haven't had a
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
performance audit but but 381 isn't
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
going to put
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
the um the special education advocate in
 
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
a position where they're going to be
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
able to change
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
um a a school district's determination
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
and if we put if we can put this money
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
um as well as the money that's uh that's
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
being appropriated or that could be
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
appropriated hopefully through house
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
420 towards uh towards supporting
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
um and funding
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
school districts taking a little bit of
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
relief off the local taxpayers who who
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
vote for their school boards and hire
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
their superintendents then i think we're
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing for uh for
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
students and families across the state
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
so that's the way to do it thank you
 
00:43:11.119 --> 00:43:12.470 align:start position:0%
so that's the way to do it thank you
further

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
the thing that really struck me about
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
our hearing was the fact that
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
34 students come to the doe for 34
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
parents 34 cases we have a place in the
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
doe that deals with all this stuff
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't get used and so i have to
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
ask why why if we have all these
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
disgruntled parents do they not go to
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
the doe
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
and that's a big question
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
and um i don't know whether it's they're
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
intimidated by the idea of the doe and
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
they don't want to go there
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
i can see that as an issue if this was
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
in that other agency where
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
parents who are dealing with kids with
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
may be saying
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
why are they sending me to the to an
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
organization that deals with juvenile
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
delinquents there's nothing wrong with
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
my kid
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
they don't misbehave or anything they
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
just need the special ed help and so i
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
can see that being a reason
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
why we wouldn't put it in the other
 
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.950 align:start position:0%
why we wouldn't put it in the other
organization

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
i wonder and i don't know the answer
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
but i wonder if they had somebody who
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
was not with the doe
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
who had the title of advocate if they
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
might feel more comfortable bringing
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
their kids there than going before the
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
doe i don't know i was quite disturbed
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
by the fact that there was only 34
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
going there and i know i did talk to a
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
parent from my town the other day
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
and i said well why didn't you go to the
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
doe and she's like well i think i have
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
to be ready to
 
00:44:53.839 --> 00:44:54.550 align:start position:0%
to be ready to
to

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
um have a lawsuit or something to go
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
before the doe and it's like no
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
i you know i don't know and i don't know
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
if just having that friendly title of
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
advocate would make parents feel more
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
comfortable i don't know what the answer
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
to that is but i do ask that question
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
further just represent tanner and then
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative porter thank you and and
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lakers because
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's my question also
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
is why are we not doing something with
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
the department of education instead of
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
creating a whole new bureaucracy under
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
this office of of um
 
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.790 align:start position:0%
this office of of um
advocacy

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
advocacy
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
they have lawyers now at the doe uh
 
00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
certainly with additional funds they
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
could hire
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
another lawyer just specifically for
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
special education they have a complaint
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
department maybe that isn't advertised
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
as well maybe that's something the
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
performance audit would show
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
it certainly would be more efficient
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
to do it under the department of
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
education instead of a separate advocacy
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
group and that's why
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know i can't support this bill right
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
now i think if we had a study committee
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
we're not kicking the can down
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
the wrong road
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make sure that it's the
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
right road and i think sometimes
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
jumping on something like this being
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
impulsive about it has unintended
 
00:46:21.359 --> 00:46:22.870 align:start position:0%
impulsive about it has unintended
consequences

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
and also a financial burden so
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing that up
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative nelson
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman as a special ed
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
teacher and a special ed administrator
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
for 25 30 years
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
i would be more
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
concerned if all of a sudden somebody
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
walked in as the independent officer
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just telling from my spot i would be
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
a little nervous so i think this is
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
really a good idea to go with
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative porter
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i saw recently an
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
annotated version of this bill that came
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
from i believe miss dunham who works for
 
00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.349 align:start position:0%
from i believe miss dunham who works for
pic

00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
pic
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
and her concern was
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
the use of the term advocate and how
 
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.069 align:start position:0%
the use of the term advocate and how
that

00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
would be interpreted by families
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
as someone who would be able to be
 
00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:14.390 align:start position:0%
as someone who would be able to be
present

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.670 align:start position:0%
present
um

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
for them
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
at hearings and things like that and
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
that she she suggested a different
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
term be used
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know we all want to help these
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
parents and i'm just concerned that this
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
is going to set up a system that sounds
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
like it's going to help
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
you and
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
ends up
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
having no teeth and
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
really not helping much with your
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
particular child it's
 
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.750 align:start position:0%
particular child it's
it

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
it just worries me that's all i would
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
like to see us do something that
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
actually would work and perhaps getting
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
the department of education's
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
complaint department advertised and up
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
to speed so people understand what's
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
going on with it
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
would be more helpful and representative
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
nelson you might be right saying an
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
independent person is coming in to
 
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.030 align:start position:0%
independent person is coming in to
investigate

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
might have more teeth for the special ed
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
department i don't know about that
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
it would sound more like they have no
 
00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
authority to me but that might be just
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
my interpretation so it's not that we
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
don't want help for these parents that
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
have got concerns
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
but we want to do it in a way that's
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
actually going to help them and i'm not
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%

01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
given the the discussion deliberation we
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
had this morning where i think a number
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
of very strong points and there were a
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
number of questions brought up if we
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
might be able to recall uh director
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%

the prevailing side for reconsideration
no

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
no in in the committee hearings you can
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
actually you don't have to be on the
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
prevailing side one way or you can offer
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
ask for reconsideration on a vote for a
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
number of reasons so there's emergency
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
purposes and all that i've been through
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
this before
 
01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:36.789 align:start position:0%
this before
and

01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
okay madam clerk would you call the role
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
rather than a chair
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
yes would this motion be appropriately
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
uh discussed as other motion in terms of
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
the person that made the motion the
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
second if they want to speak to it
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
i i will allow the person that made the
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
motion and
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
to speak to it if
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
if she would like thank you
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to say
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
thinking back of
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
the conversations i have had with
 
01:05:14.319 --> 01:05:17.589 align:start position:0%
the conversations i have had with
parents

01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
first off
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
i do not believe that parents would want
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
to an organization that is known for
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with delinquent children when
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
they just have a kid who's not getting
 
01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:32.390 align:start position:0%
they just have a kid who's not getting
their

01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.910 align:start position:0%
 
dyslexia

01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
dyslexia
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know taken care of or whatever i
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
think that's the wrong organization
 
01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.349 align:start position:0%
think that's the wrong organization
and

01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
the fact that only 34 people are coming
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
to the doe which has the ability to do
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
these things
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
why is that and i just think i
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
i've come to the conclusion that parents
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
would be much more likely to use an
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
advocate for special education
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
and so let's give them the opportunity
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
and then we can think about next year
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
putting in more teeth or giving them
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
more ability as we see how that goes or
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
taking or getting rid of it if it
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't work if if parents are still not
 
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
going to it we can get rid of it but
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
at least to start with let's give it a
 
01:06:21.839 --> 01:06:24.150 align:start position:0%
at least to start with let's give it a
chance

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
chance
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay we'll remove this
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
yes um you know
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much given representative
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
likus's um rationale for uh for moving
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
um uh reconsideration
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
um based on the limitation of the office
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate for just to
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
work with um i think the term the term
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
that was used was was delinquent
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
children believe their role is much more
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
expansive than that extensive than that
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
and i think i think it would it would um
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
be helpful to this committee to hear
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
from director sanchez you know in terms
 
01:07:00.559 --> 01:07:01.190 align:start position:0%
from director sanchez you know in terms

01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh i would just say that uh
 
01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.870 align:start position:0%
um and uh i would just say that uh
the

01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
federal law uh comes into play with that
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
and that's something we could look into
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
in the future as to
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh how much um teeth could be given to
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
an office
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
of this kind
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
but that certainly can be looked into
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
luna thank you very much mr chair i
 
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
believe the characterization of the
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
does not properly reflect their their
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
actual role
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
and what they've done
 
01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:17.750 align:start position:0%
since the the office was created
 
01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:19.590 align:start position:0%
since the the office was created
[Music]

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
over the last um i think it was six
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
and um five or six years ago and uh and
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
and where their role is going with uh
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
with to to be able to provide
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
comprehensive advocacy for uh for
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
children across the state and um and i
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
certainly don't believe that that i have
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
sufficient familiarity with the office
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
of child advocate to speak to it and
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
would really appreciate if if we could
 
01:09:43.759 --> 01:09:44.709 align:start position:0%
would really appreciate if if we could
recall

01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
recall
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
um cassandra sanchez to um to to um to
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
again enlighten the committee as to as
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
to their current role their expanded
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
role the direction they're going with um
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
with advocacy and education thank you
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.110 align:start position:0%
further discussion
so

01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
there was there was a question that to
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
the chair and that if we could recall uh
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
director sanchez
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
director uh cassandra sanchez has uh
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
previously provided us a memo a letter
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
from her agency
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
and she has spoken with the committee
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh characterization of the the agency in
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
whether they're doing your job one way
 
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
or the other i i think we all believe
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
the child advocate is
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
doing a
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
a job in accordance with what they're
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
required to do by statute
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
my reference earlier was certainly just
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
that i had read a specific sentence out
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
of the letter from
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh director sanchez which stated we also
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
lack the level of expertise that senate
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
bill 381 represents in a new agency
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's what i spoke to now i don't think
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
anybody's trying to say that um the
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
agency's uh
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
not performing or what i don't think we
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
have that expertise to make any kind of
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
a statement like that seeing we're not
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
involved with it
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
director sanchez is welcome to come up i
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
don't want another presentation if
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
there's a specific question for her then
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
that question can be asked we've done
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
that before i would love to ask a
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
question to director sanchez if
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
director sanchez is willing to come
 
01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:41.750 align:start position:0%

forward

01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%

01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
for again taking the time with this
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee this morning i was wondering
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
if you could um uh tell us a little bit
 
01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.510 align:start position:0%
if you could um uh tell us a little bit
about

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
the expanded role into education and and
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
what what your office's plans are to be
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
able to uh to fulfill that role and
 
01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.470 align:start position:0%
able to uh to fulfill that role and
provide

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive services as a as a child
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
as an office of child advocate
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
yes so this is newer expansion um this
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
took place in december 2020 so it's a
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
little bit over a year now that we have
 
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
our expanded jurisdiction for oversight
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
of all children within the state of new
 
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire so that would include special
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
education that is not specific to
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
children with delinquency issues that is
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
not specific to children involved with
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
dcyf that is all children across the
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
in that we also understand that there's
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of educating for our office to do
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
a lot do not know what we do right now
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
and they do not know what we are trying
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
to do so one of the big main steps that
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
we are looking to take
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
is to schedule meetings with
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
superintendents across the state to
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
educate them about our
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
new le our new ability to help all areas
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
of a child the the to educate them on
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
the facts that we do have access to
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
child records if needed to educate them
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
on the work that we do with families to
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
help support them in the process whether
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
it be special education whether it be
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
general education we work with all
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
children across new hampshire and
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of educating to be done
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
across the state about our new
 
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.709 align:start position:0%
across the state about our new
jurisdiction

01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.470 align:start position:0%
representative uh lekkas do you have a
question

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
i had a comment and i guess i should
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
also say it to you
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
i was not in any way knocking your
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
organization nor was i saying that was
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
my opinion of your organization i was
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
saying that that was a common opinion
 
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
amongst parents and we're looking at how
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
do we attract parents and that was all
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
that was so i just wanted you to know
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
that was no knock on your organization
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and i do believe that we
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
understand that as an organization we
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
understand that we need to reach the
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
parents we need them to understand what
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
it is that we do so that is another
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
initiative that we are taking on is to
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are educating the
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
public educating parents meeting working
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
with the parent information centers
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
part of educating the superintendents
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
are for them to guide families to our
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
office when they are struggling and
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
having issues but again we understand
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of educating to do and
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
that is where our focus is right now
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.830 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
not trying to micromanage you mr chair
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that i'm thinking
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
about um is mission creep um between
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
maybe an advocate versus um some of your
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
other agencies
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
um do you how can you assure that uh

01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh i have an amendment to the bill
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%

okay
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
let me do a little discussion here first
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
on this one
 
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
we we've been working with the
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
senate because they've dealing with 15
 
01:31:39.679 --> 01:31:41.189 align:start position:0%
senate because they've dealing with 15
13.

01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
13.
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
and you you're we're you're aware of
 
01:31:42.719 --> 01:31:43.510 align:start position:0%
and you you're we're you're aware of
that

01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
um 1513 is a bill that's dealing with
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
exactly the same topic
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
and now we have the senate bill right
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
here in front of us and there's also a
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
court case down to rhode island
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
which is dealt with this and issued a
 
01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:00.070 align:start position:0%
which is dealt with this and issued a
resolution

01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
in talking with our attorneys over at
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
the department of education we have two
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
over there we have chris bond and diana
 
01:32:06.719 --> 01:32:07.990 align:start position:0%
over there we have chris bond and diana
fenton

01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
fenton
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
one's a colonel one's a light colonel
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know who the colonel is
 
01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:12.709 align:start position:0%
you know who the colonel is
um

01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
the it's
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
time and job um
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
we we have been informed that the
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
language which initially submitted to us
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
in 1513
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
is most likely
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
going to move forward without a lot of
 
01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
controversy it
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
when we've been trying to work with 21
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
through the end of the semester or
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
through their
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
years as being 21 same thing with 22
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
we come up in conflict with the rhode
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
island resolution
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
so we've been advised that the best way
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
to go with is the
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
the bill as we wrote and asked we
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
knocked out of this committee earlier
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
this year of 1513.
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
so so let's just have some discussion on
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
that before we go anywhere with it
 
01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
ref sermon i thank you um we amended
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
1513 to the end of the school year in
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
which the student turned 21 before we
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
passed it out of committee yeah they're
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
they're talking about as the bill was
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
introduced ah the original original bill
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
before we messed with it
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that's the one that's going
 
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
less controversial right my follow-up to
 
01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative vlad is that i have uh an
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
amendment to 394 should we get to that
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
process okay representative cornell and
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
then representative woodcock you had
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
your hands up i i don't know if you can
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
but can you just briefly
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
the difference between the bill we sent
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
over and this one so
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
that will
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
not cause it to be a law problem yeah
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
cordelia you were the one that
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
introduced that bill initially as it
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
came to us why don't you explain
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
several of us could do it but i think
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli could do it more
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
succinctly than myself
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes the uh 1513 as
 
01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.669 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes the uh 1513 as
introduced

01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:34:09.679 --> 01:34:10.470 align:start position:0%
introduced
said

01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
child with disability means any person
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 3 and 21 inclusive
 
01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.390 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 3 and 21 inclusive
which

01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:19.669 align:start position:0%
which
paralleled

01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
paralleled
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
01:34:21.199 --> 01:34:23.350 align:start position:0%
the federal
statute

01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
so we do have an amendment that
 
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:26.790 align:start position:0%
so we do have an amendment that
took

01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
took
 
01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:27.830 align:start position:0%
took
that

01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
original 1513 language and
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's the amendment to 394.
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
um and we went over that with uh both um
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
as representative uh lad mentioned with
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
attorney bond and attorney fenton
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
so 1513 is is 21 inclusive and doesn't
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
get into the 22 at all okay
 
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.510 align:start position:0%
get into the 22 at all okay
as

01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
as it was introduced to our committee
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
not as it left our committee
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%

01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
question is to you as
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative of the committee
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
have you been in contact with the
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
people from the senate who seem to uh
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
have had that bill if they are if they
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%

01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
initial or are they going to change it i
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
don't i don't mind glenn
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
taking your opinion i can't advertise
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
what i think they might be doing but i
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
have talked with senator khan
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i talked with jay just yesterday
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
numerous times
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
um he did have a amendment which i went
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
down and and tried to speak with him
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon late
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
and his administrative assistant was
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
there he wasn't there his amendment
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
would establish a commission to look at
 
01:35:58.239 --> 01:35:59.910 align:start position:0%
would establish a commission to look at
this

01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
and the commission would have a litany
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
of of responsibilities that that
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
commission would have i indicated to the
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant in his office
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon late
 
01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:12.390 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon late
that

01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
we've been advised by the department of
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
education attorneys that the way to go
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
is with the as it came to us originally
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
i have not had any feedback back from
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
jay since then is my fault yes thank you
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
sir is it possible to get um i know you
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
have to break shortly is it possible to
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
get a copy of the original bill
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
and then vote on after lunch so we have
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
a chance to reread it i i think that
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea that maybe what we
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
ought to do right now is
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
because i'm from i have a copy of that
 
01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
the one you have representative mullen
 
01:36:46.639 --> 01:36:47.750 align:start position:0%
the one you have representative mullen
um

01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:48.550 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
the the or the i have represented khan's
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
suggestions it's not in no i don't mean
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
that rick i mean if we're going to go
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
back to the house bill yeah and we're
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to negate
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to negate taking
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
action on this
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
then can is it possible if we can get
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
original copy of that bill that would
 
01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:05.830 align:start position:0%
original copy of that bill that would
actually

01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
yes and what you can also
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
you can have this amendment right here
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
which is that bill okay um
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
you can do both
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
rick i think it would be helpful to sort
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
of lay out what what you what
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
it sounds like your plan is to offer an
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to to 394 that has 394 read
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
exactly the same way as house bill 1513
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
as introduced
 
01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.870 align:start position:0%
as introduced
exactly

01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:39.109 align:start position:0%
exactly
exactly

01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
but but also that rick do you want to
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
talk about what that kicks off as far as
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
the the scenic road through the
 
01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:48.390 align:start position:0%
the the scenic road through the
legislature

01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
well you see if we
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
if we we revert back to this
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
then that's going to definitely
 
01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
go over to the um
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to go to the senate as and
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up in the committee
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
conference it first goes to finance
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
yes that's why it's an early bill and
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
and uh looking at this particular bill i
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
don't see much of an issue there either
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's it's going to end up
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
the end of the road is going to be a
 
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee a conference and we're just
 
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
going to have to
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
to meet and decide which way we're going
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
and i would assume
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
that we're going to try to avoid the
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
route of all the litigation
 
01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:27.030 align:start position:0%
route of all the litigation
representative

01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
so uh with regards thank you mr chair
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um with regards
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
to the commit the the amendment that
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
seeks to establish the commission
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
is that doa or are we looking to
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
act on two amendments to 394 today
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
that would be a discussion for us
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
um you can always add an amendment to
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
you know you can
 
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
right it doesn't replace it's a separate
 
01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
it's a new section
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so if you if that amendment were to
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
my gut feeling i i'll tell you what my
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
gut says right now you we've mentioned
 
01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
before and you can talk to people over
 
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
office legislative services or folks
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
upstairs in the fourth floor the word's
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
been put out that a commission isn't
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
going to go very far this year
 
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of passage
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
although we've seen several committees
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
come over from the senate side proposals
 
01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.390 align:start position:0%
come over from the senate side proposals
so

01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.950 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
my bet my money would be on that it's
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's it could be added in but it would
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
probably be taken out somewhere along
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
the way
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's okay i'm just looking to execute my
 
01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:43.189 align:start position:0%
it's okay i'm just looking to execute my
responsibilities

01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
if you if you like what we could do is
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
just not take any action on this one
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
right now come back after lunch you
 
01:39:49.590 --> 01:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
could have a chance to talk with some
 
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
folks you could talk to with
 
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
senator khan et cetera
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
and and and uh
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
check with this office and see if
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
they're good with the way 1513 initially
 
01:40:00.159 --> 01:40:01.990 align:start position:0%
they're good with the way 1513 initially
came

01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
came
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
i think that's probably the route we
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
should take
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
take action after lunch on this bill and
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
discuss it then
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:13.350 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
okay

01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%

01:40:21.119 --> 01:40:22.709 align:start position:0%
 
yeah yeah

01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%

this amendment was
 
03:09:12.479 --> 03:09:13.590 align:start position:0%
this amendment was
drafted

03:09:13.590 --> 03:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
03:09:15.349 --> 03:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
after conversations
 
03:09:17.349 --> 03:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
with the attorneys from the department
 
03:09:18.790 --> 03:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
of education
 
03:09:21.349 --> 03:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
and in particular
 
03:09:24.950 --> 03:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
attorney bond who was here and testified
 
03:09:26.389 --> 03:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
about the
 
03:09:28.550 --> 03:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
rhode island case and its implications
 
03:09:30.469 --> 03:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
for us
 
03:09:33.269 --> 03:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
i think there was a similar
 
03:09:37.830 --> 03:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:37.840 --> 03:09:38.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:09:38.630 --> 03:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:09:41.110 --> 03:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
what we did was uh
 
03:09:42.389 --> 03:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
go back
 
03:09:47.590 --> 03:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
to the original uh hb 1513s submitted
 
03:09:50.229 --> 03:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
which included the language
 
03:09:50.239 --> 03:09:51.269 align:start position:0%
which included the language
that

03:09:51.269 --> 03:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:09:53.349 --> 03:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh child with disability means any
 
03:09:56.229 --> 03:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
person between the ages of 3 and 21
 
03:09:56.239 --> 03:09:57.510 align:start position:0%
person between the ages of 3 and 21
inclusive

03:09:57.510 --> 03:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
03:10:00.950 --> 03:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
which mirrors the federal
 
03:10:00.960 --> 03:10:02.229 align:start position:0%
which mirrors the federal
language

03:10:02.229 --> 03:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:10:02.239 --> 03:10:02.950 align:start position:0%
language
in

03:10:02.950 --> 03:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:10.070 --> 03:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
so we should be on
 
03:10:13.510 --> 03:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
safe ground legally if anyone wants to
 
03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
bring a challenge
 
03:10:17.910 --> 03:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
we we also
 
03:10:19.990 --> 03:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
would be now in compliance with the
 
03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:21.269 align:start position:0%
would be now in compliance with the
federal

03:10:21.269 --> 03:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:10:24.870 --> 03:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we provide services
 
03:10:27.590 --> 03:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
to children with disabilities through
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:34.469 --> 03:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the
 
03:10:34.479 --> 03:10:38.469 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the
second

03:10:38.469 --> 03:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:41.590 --> 03:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
basically unfortunately we've got to do
 
03:10:43.990 --> 03:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
this i like leaving it to the towns to
 
03:10:45.910 --> 03:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
decide but
 
03:10:47.349 --> 03:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
looks like we're going to be facing
 
03:10:50.550 --> 03:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuits if we don't
 
03:10:51.910 --> 03:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
03:10:54.150 --> 03:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear the issue that we
 
03:10:56.309 --> 03:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
had been concerned about was
 
03:10:58.630 --> 03:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
young people being dropped from programs
 
03:11:01.110 --> 03:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
mid-year and this
 
03:11:03.349 --> 03:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't solve that problem
 
03:11:06.229 --> 03:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
but it makes us in compliance is that
 
03:11:08.950 --> 03:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
is that where where we are that we
 
03:11:10.469 --> 03:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
03:11:13.269 --> 03:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
takes us closer to compliance i don't
 
03:11:15.349 --> 03:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
want to say that we're all the way there
 
03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
but we've gotten that from
 
03:11:19.830 --> 03:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
both of the attorneys at the department
 
03:11:22.070 --> 03:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
of education i'd like to also take this
 
03:11:23.750 --> 03:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
moment though to we have another
 
03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of us while we're in
 
03:11:27.510 --> 03:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
discussion mode here
 
03:11:29.830 --> 03:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
03:11:31.990 --> 03:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
there there's some rationale for that
 
03:11:34.229 --> 03:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
amendment as well
 
03:11:34.239 --> 03:11:35.110 align:start position:0%
amendment as well
and

03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:36.630 --> 03:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative mullen would you like to
 
03:11:39.429 --> 03:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
explain that at all or sure
 
03:11:42.070 --> 03:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i would be happy to uh for your
 
03:11:45.190 --> 03:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
viewing pleasure i have uh
 
03:11:45.200 --> 03:11:46.469 align:start position:0%
viewing pleasure i have uh
amendment

03:11:46.469 --> 03:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:11:46.479 --> 03:11:49.269 align:start position:0%
amendment
1488h

03:11:49.269 --> 03:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
1488h
 
03:11:51.910 --> 03:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
to senate bill 394
 
03:11:55.830 --> 03:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
and this amendment establishes a special
 
03:11:59.269 --> 03:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
education eligibility commission
 
03:12:01.750 --> 03:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
the membership of the commission is
 
03:12:04.389 --> 03:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
outlined on the first page
 
03:12:06.229 --> 03:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that you'll be
 
03:12:08.389 --> 03:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
surprised by the personnel that's
 
03:12:08.399 --> 03:12:10.469 align:start position:0%
surprised by the personnel that's
included

03:12:10.469 --> 03:12:10.479 align:start position:0%
included
 
03:12:12.950 --> 03:12:12.960 align:start position:0%

school administrators association and on
 
03:12:24.630 --> 03:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
03:12:27.030 --> 03:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
thing the purpose of this
 
03:12:30.469 --> 03:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
study is to look if we can
 
03:12:33.429 --> 03:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
at the implications of changing the
 
03:12:37.349 --> 03:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
eligibility ages to 21 inclusive
 
03:12:37.359 --> 03:12:38.150 align:start position:0%
eligibility ages to 21 inclusive
so

03:12:38.150 --> 03:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:12:41.750 --> 03:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh there of course is the definition
 
03:12:43.990 --> 03:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
itself and and
 
03:12:46.469 --> 03:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
who that opens up services to that
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
currently are not eligible for services
 
03:12:52.710 --> 03:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh on page two
 
03:12:55.590 --> 03:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
we look at defining the end of the
 
03:12:57.190 --> 03:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
school year that was one of the
 
03:13:00.070 --> 03:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
questions that came out of our hearing
 
03:13:02.229 --> 03:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
different districts looking at the
 
03:13:05.030 --> 03:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
school year is ending at different times
 
03:13:08.469 --> 03:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the additional costs of
 
03:13:08.479 --> 03:13:09.990 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the additional costs of
extending

03:13:09.990 --> 03:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
extending
 
03:13:12.150 --> 03:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
programs both
 
03:13:14.550 --> 03:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
for residential students and for
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
students who are non-residential but may
 
03:13:20.070 --> 03:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
in fact still be in high school
 
03:13:24.309 --> 03:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
after the age of 18 and uh prior to
 
03:13:26.630 --> 03:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
either 21 inclusive or getting a high
 
03:13:28.630 --> 03:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
school diploma
 
03:13:32.229 --> 03:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact on differentiated aid
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
payments the
 
03:13:38.469 --> 03:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
impact on
 
03:13:41.190 --> 03:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
developmentally delayed adults some of
 
03:13:43.910 --> 03:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
whom receive special education services
 
03:13:47.030 --> 03:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
others who don't there we need to look
 
03:13:51.030 --> 03:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
at the interface between dhhs and
 
03:13:53.110 --> 03:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
special education for
 
03:13:55.670 --> 03:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
those students as well
 
03:13:57.750 --> 03:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's a standard you know legislative
 
03:14:01.110 --> 03:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
members will receive mileage uh and then
 
03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
the procedural things uh round out the
 
03:14:04.319 --> 03:14:05.590 align:start position:0%
the procedural things uh round out the
amendment

03:14:05.590 --> 03:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:14:05.600 --> 03:14:06.710 align:start position:0%
amendment
uh

03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:14:09.670 --> 03:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
you know much like the performance audit
 
03:14:12.150 --> 03:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about this morning
 
03:14:12.160 --> 03:14:13.670 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about this morning
uh

03:14:13.670 --> 03:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:14:17.429 --> 03:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
changing the definition to 21 inclusive
 
03:14:20.229 --> 03:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
prior to the study looks like it's the
 
03:14:22.950 --> 03:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
only option because we need to change
 
03:14:22.960 --> 03:14:23.830 align:start position:0%
only option because we need to change
the

03:14:23.830 --> 03:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
age to be in compliance with federal law
 
03:14:30.309 --> 03:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime that does not remove
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
from the equation the fact that we need
 
03:14:34.309 --> 03:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
answers to that
 
03:14:37.030 --> 03:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
boatload of questions that we generated
 
03:14:39.670 --> 03:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves and through listening
 
03:14:39.680 --> 03:14:40.550 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves and through listening
to

03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:14:43.030 --> 03:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
various stakeholders uh when we heard
 
03:14:45.030 --> 03:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
this bill last week
 
03:14:47.110 --> 03:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions that
 
03:14:49.670 --> 03:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
anybody might have
 
03:14:52.469 --> 03:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
okay for all those out there this this
 
03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
commission and i've had
 
03:14:57.110 --> 03:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
some discussions with
 
03:14:59.750 --> 03:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
the original maker of the
 
03:15:01.269 --> 03:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
of the commission
 
03:15:04.550 --> 03:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
and uh there there are issues
 
03:15:06.309 --> 03:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for a long time has been
 
03:15:08.389 --> 03:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
pretty insulated from what's going on
 
03:15:11.429 --> 03:15:11.439 align:start position:0%
here with this issue of 21 22 21
 
03:15:11.439 --> 03:15:13.349 align:start position:0%
here with this issue of 21 22 21
inclusive

03:15:13.349 --> 03:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
03:15:13.359 --> 03:15:14.630 align:start position:0%
inclusive
and

03:15:14.630 --> 03:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:15:17.190 --> 03:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
adult education is part of the equation
 
03:15:17.200 --> 03:15:18.070 align:start position:0%
adult education is part of the equation
here

03:15:18.070 --> 03:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:15:19.670 --> 03:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh you could have a student that's
 
03:15:21.750 --> 03:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
non-special ed
 
03:15:21.760 --> 03:15:22.710 align:start position:0%
non-special ed
that's

03:15:22.710 --> 03:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:15:26.950 --> 03:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
age 21 and wants to finish finish out
 
03:15:26.960 --> 03:15:27.830 align:start position:0%
age 21 and wants to finish finish out
their

03:15:27.830 --> 03:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:15:29.110 --> 03:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
high school
 
03:15:31.190 --> 03:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
graduation diploma
 
03:15:31.200 --> 03:15:32.150 align:start position:0%
graduation diploma
and

03:15:32.150 --> 03:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:15:33.830 --> 03:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
that can be now done through adult
 
03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:35.269 align:start position:0%
that can be now done through adult
education

03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:15:37.510 --> 03:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
but that's done through tuition money
 
03:15:40.389 --> 03:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
but provided by the student
 
03:15:43.030 --> 03:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
because they're done the 21 bit they're
 
03:15:46.389 --> 03:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
there they hit that red light you're out
 
03:15:46.399 --> 03:15:47.429 align:start position:0%
there they hit that red light you're out
um

03:15:47.429 --> 03:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:51.429 --> 03:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
so it opens up the door possibly for a
 
03:15:53.590 --> 03:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
a suit
 
03:15:55.110 --> 03:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
you're providing it for this student but
 
03:15:56.550 --> 03:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
you're not providing for this student
 
03:15:58.150 --> 03:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not special ed so i don't get the
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
same type of privilege that type of
 
03:15:59.840 --> 03:16:01.510 align:start position:0%
same type of privilege that type of
thing

03:16:01.510 --> 03:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:16:04.870 --> 03:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
and so i think that's that's
 
03:16:06.870 --> 03:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
somewhat trying to be addressed through
 
03:16:08.870 --> 03:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
a commissioned study
 
03:16:12.389 --> 03:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
the commission study also has some
 
03:16:12.399 --> 03:16:15.830 align:start position:0%
the commission study also has some
wide-ranging

03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:18.389 --> 03:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh conditions which we're chasing in
 
03:16:20.229 --> 03:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
special education which has nothing to
 
03:16:22.710 --> 03:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
do with age 21.
 
03:16:24.469 --> 03:16:24.479 align:start position:0%
it deals with catastrophic aid if you
 
03:16:26.309 --> 03:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
read it carefully
 
03:16:26.319 --> 03:16:27.110 align:start position:0%
read it carefully
and

03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:27.120 --> 03:16:27.910 align:start position:0%
and
the

03:16:27.910 --> 03:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:16:29.190 --> 03:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
issue that
 
03:16:31.269 --> 03:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
as an administrator in another state we
 
03:16:32.950 --> 03:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
had what we call forward funding we knew
 
03:16:34.710 --> 03:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
what our funding was going to be and we
 
03:16:36.630 --> 03:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
received that money in the year that our
 
03:16:38.710 --> 03:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
expenses existed
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
our our costing our revenue comes in
 
03:16:44.309 --> 03:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
based upon what we had last year so the
 
03:16:46.469 --> 03:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid kid hits you and you
 
03:16:47.990 --> 03:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't have any revenue especially as a
 
03:16:49.910 --> 03:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
small district you have no wherewithal
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
you don't have a till you can go knock
 
03:16:54.389 --> 03:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
on take that money out
 
03:16:56.389 --> 03:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
and and of course we've tried to address
 
03:16:58.070 --> 03:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
that through you know working together
 
03:16:59.510 --> 03:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
as districts i don't think anybody's
 
03:17:01.590 --> 03:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of that yet but that's
 
03:17:04.710 --> 03:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
item d i h excuse me on where it says
 
03:17:06.469 --> 03:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
determining how state special education
 
03:17:09.190 --> 03:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
cost sharing under the rsa on special
 
03:17:11.590 --> 03:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
education state aid can be accelerated
 
03:17:13.510 --> 03:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
into the school year
 
03:17:17.830 --> 03:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
in which expenses are incurred
 
03:17:19.990 --> 03:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
so you're trying to get the monies for
 
03:17:21.910 --> 03:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
that cat aid
 
03:17:21.920 --> 03:17:23.269 align:start position:0%
that cat aid
child

03:17:23.269 --> 03:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:17:25.910 --> 03:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
and so this is a far-reaching study
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
commission that's what i'm trying to say
 
03:17:30.950 --> 03:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
it goes well beyond the issue of 21.
 
03:17:34.229 --> 03:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
and and of course my response to the the
 
03:17:36.550 --> 03:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
maker of the com of this saying there's
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit of non-germaneus in this
 
03:17:42.070 --> 03:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
um however i know where it's going and i
 
03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
know that the the intent and the intent
 
03:17:45.990 --> 03:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
is good intent
 
03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:46.790 align:start position:0%
is good intent
so

03:17:46.790 --> 03:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:46.800 --> 03:17:48.790 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:50.790 --> 03:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
i i the
 
03:17:53.190 --> 03:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
this commission report is also available
 
03:17:54.389 --> 03:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
to 15
 
03:17:56.550 --> 03:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
13 as well
 
03:17:59.910 --> 03:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
and also available if it ever got
 
03:18:01.590 --> 03:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
our bill if it makes it out to the house
 
03:18:03.830 --> 03:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
and out to finance
 
03:18:03.840 --> 03:18:05.590 align:start position:0%
and out to finance
um

03:18:05.590 --> 03:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:07.590 --> 03:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
so that that's just my take on it right
 
03:18:07.600 --> 03:18:08.790 align:start position:0%
so that that's just my take on it right
now

03:18:08.790 --> 03:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:18:10.870 --> 03:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
yes represent woodcock here's the
 
03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
clarification because i want to be sure
 
03:18:15.830 --> 03:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
on two things one two on not the
 
03:18:17.830 --> 03:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
amendment without the prior amendment
 
03:18:19.750 --> 03:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
revenue quarterly amendment does not
 
03:18:21.349 --> 03:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
dress it does not address the
 
03:18:24.790 --> 03:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
end-of-year piece that's correct okay um
 
03:18:26.870 --> 03:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
well just this is the other part if you
 
03:18:29.590 --> 03:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
will explain your your writing of this
 
03:18:31.349 --> 03:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
on line two
 
03:18:34.150 --> 03:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
and line fourteen where it's bolded
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
when it says and perhaps representative
 
03:18:39.030 --> 03:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
moffett who's our writer over there uh 3
 
03:18:43.190 --> 03:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
and 21 comma inclusive comma but yet on
 
03:18:47.349 --> 03:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
line 14 it just says and 21 inclusive
 
03:18:49.349 --> 03:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
when the inclusive is bracketed between
 
03:18:51.670 --> 03:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
the two commas
 
03:18:53.510 --> 03:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
does that change the meaning
 
03:18:53.520 --> 03:18:54.550 align:start position:0%
does that change the meaning
versus

03:18:54.550 --> 03:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
versus
 
03:18:54.560 --> 03:19:02.150 align:start position:0%
versus
after

03:19:02.150 --> 03:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
sat directed to anybody well i was
 
03:19:05.990 --> 03:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
asking or
 
03:19:07.830 --> 03:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
directed to a professor representative
 
03:19:09.750 --> 03:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
moffett is the writer so so he may have
 
03:19:09.760 --> 03:19:11.190 align:start position:0%
moffett is the writer so so he may have
it

03:19:11.190 --> 03:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:19:14.950 --> 03:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:14.960 --> 03:19:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:19:19.510 --> 03:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:22.150 --> 03:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
no just where it's bracketed uh
 
03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
mike does it change the meaning of three
 
03:19:24.950 --> 03:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
to twenty one verse where it's not
 
03:19:31.190 --> 03:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:34.229 --> 03:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
to change the meaning it's all
 
03:19:35.830 --> 03:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
i read to change the meaning but my
 
03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
associate to the left told me i was
 
03:19:40.870 --> 03:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:43.670 --> 03:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to comment
 
03:19:47.110 --> 03:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:49.590 --> 03:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
represent cordelia
 
03:19:52.790 --> 03:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you in the federal stat statute it
 
03:19:55.429 --> 03:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
says a free appropriate public education
 
03:19:56.950 --> 03:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
is available to all children with
 
03:19:58.630 --> 03:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities residing in the state
 
03:20:02.070 --> 03:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 3 and 21 comma
 
03:20:03.990 --> 03:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
inclusive comma
 
03:20:06.070 --> 03:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
including children with disabilities et
 
03:20:06.080 --> 03:20:07.349 align:start position:0%
including children with disabilities et
cetera

03:20:07.349 --> 03:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
cetera
 
03:20:09.910 --> 03:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
so so it is in federal statute it is
 
03:20:12.389 --> 03:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
bracketed with commas as well so on 14
 
03:20:15.990 --> 03:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
should there also be a additional comma
 
03:20:17.429 --> 03:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
03:20:18.870 --> 03:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:20:20.389 --> 03:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
03:20:22.710 --> 03:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
you know likely legislative intent would
 
03:20:24.710 --> 03:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
would apply okay on that if it were to
 
03:20:27.510 --> 03:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
be interpreted differently um
 
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
but um mr chair i do have a i do have a
 
03:20:32.229 --> 03:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
comment though on both the um the mullet
 
03:20:33.910 --> 03:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and the cordelia amendment if
 
03:20:36.070 --> 03:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
i might
 
03:20:39.030 --> 03:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
all right yeah yeah um so i i agree with
 
03:20:40.870 --> 03:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
you that i think the um the mullen
 
03:20:44.550 --> 03:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is um is very important i um i
 
03:20:47.910 --> 03:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't think it um it
 
03:20:49.990 --> 03:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
comes close to the
 
03:20:52.389 --> 03:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh question of whether it's germaine or
 
03:20:54.710 --> 03:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
non-germane because i think it uh it is
 
03:20:54.720 --> 03:20:56.389 align:start position:0%
non-germane because i think it uh it is
squarely

03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
squarely
 
03:20:59.269 --> 03:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
you know rooted on on definition of a
 
03:20:59.279 --> 03:21:02.630 align:start position:0%
you know rooted on on definition of a
child

03:21:02.630 --> 03:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:04.150 --> 03:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
regarding definition of a child with a
 
03:21:06.229 --> 03:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
disability under special education laws
 
03:21:08.070 --> 03:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
which is the title of the bill
 
03:21:09.190 --> 03:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:21:12.150 --> 03:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
and and the study section i think is is
 
03:21:13.830 --> 03:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
also um
 
03:21:16.870 --> 03:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh very important
 
03:21:20.469 --> 03:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
in uh in considering um a child with a
 
03:21:20.479 --> 03:21:22.150 align:start position:0%
in uh in considering um a child with a
disability

03:21:22.150 --> 03:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
disability
 
03:21:26.070 --> 03:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
and uh in new hampshire's um you know
 
03:21:26.080 --> 03:21:26.950 align:start position:0%
and uh in new hampshire's um you know
um

03:21:26.950 --> 03:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:29.910 --> 03:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
trove of special education
 
03:21:31.750 --> 03:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
laws which are not the same as rhode
 
03:21:35.110 --> 03:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
island's laws so um so i think it's it's
 
03:21:38.309 --> 03:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a leap at this stage for for
 
03:21:39.670 --> 03:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
anybody to
 
03:21:41.910 --> 03:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
to say that the
 
03:21:45.670 --> 03:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
the the court decision in rhode island
 
03:21:49.349 --> 03:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
um uh is is exactly the same situation
 
03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
as it would be here in new hampshire
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
because i think it is it is different it
 
03:21:57.190 --> 03:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
may be the same or it may it may apply
 
03:21:59.110 --> 03:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
to us but it might not apply and i think
 
03:22:00.870 --> 03:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's a very serious question and i
 
03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
think a serious question that this that
 
03:22:05.910 --> 03:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
the study commission would um uh would
 
03:22:09.429 --> 03:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
look at so you know it may be true that
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is not in compliance with
 
03:22:14.950 --> 03:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
with federal law but it might not be
 
03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
true it may it may be that we're
 
03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
fully compliant with with federal law um
 
03:22:21.990 --> 03:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm
 
03:22:23.910 --> 03:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
i feel personally that we've been a
 
03:22:25.269 --> 03:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
little bit rushed
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
um uh with um uh with this and and even
 
03:22:31.750 --> 03:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
um attorney bond
 
03:22:33.750 --> 03:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
suggested that
 
03:22:36.229 --> 03:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
that that new hampshire may i think you
 
03:22:38.550 --> 03:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
use the word may be different from rhode
 
03:22:41.590 --> 03:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
island and that a decision in a um in a
 
03:22:43.190 --> 03:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
new in a
 
03:22:44.070 --> 03:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
in a
 
03:22:46.469 --> 03:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
in a new hampshire case might might turn
 
03:22:49.190 --> 03:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
out to be different um
 
03:22:51.269 --> 03:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
all the more reason why i think we do
 
03:22:53.510 --> 03:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
need to proceed with the uh with the
 
03:22:54.870 --> 03:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
with the study
 
03:22:59.190 --> 03:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
um uh at the same time i'm i'm not
 
03:23:00.309 --> 03:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:23:02.469 --> 03:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
totally against you know going forward
 
03:23:05.269 --> 03:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
with the cordelia amendment either but
 
03:23:08.070 --> 03:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
but in the um in the
 
03:23:10.550 --> 03:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know sort of the the um
 
03:23:13.349 --> 03:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
you know under the i guess heading of if
 
03:23:15.990 --> 03:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
we're going into uh to a statute do we
 
03:23:19.429 --> 03:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
want to consider some um some cleanup
 
03:23:21.750 --> 03:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm a little concerned
 
03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
about um lines 13 through 17 in in
 
03:23:25.680 --> 03:23:26.870 align:start position:0%
about um lines 13 through 17 in in
cordelli

03:23:26.870 --> 03:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
03:23:30.070 --> 03:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
um where it could be it could be read
 
03:23:31.590 --> 03:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
and i think it can be read i think it is
 
03:23:34.229 --> 03:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
read child with a disability shall
 
03:23:37.830 --> 03:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
include a person between the ages of 18
 
03:23:41.190 --> 03:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
and 21 inclusive who was identified as a
 
03:23:43.990 --> 03:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
child with a disability but did not have
 
03:23:46.870 --> 03:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
an individualized education program so
 
03:23:50.229 --> 03:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
was identified but did not have an iep
 
03:23:51.990 --> 03:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
in his or her last educational
 
03:23:52.000 --> 03:23:53.510 align:start position:0%
in his or her last educational
institution

03:23:53.510 --> 03:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
institution
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that is that
 
03:23:57.750 --> 03:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
children who may have had may have been
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
identified with a disability and had an
 
03:24:03.429 --> 03:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
iep but the parents can later withdraw
 
03:24:06.309 --> 03:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
from from that from that iep
 
03:24:07.910 --> 03:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:24:09.750 --> 03:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh and and
 
03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
you know and then you're you know if you
 
03:24:13.429 --> 03:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
were to re-engage you'd have to start
 
03:24:15.030 --> 03:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
from square one
 
03:24:16.630 --> 03:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
03:24:16.640 --> 03:24:17.590 align:start position:0%
um i i
i

03:24:17.590 --> 03:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:24:19.990 --> 03:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know if
 
03:24:24.150 --> 03:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
if lines 13-17 are intended to um
 
03:24:27.349 --> 03:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh to read that way but um
 
03:24:30.389 --> 03:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
um and and largely that meaning is taken
 
03:24:32.229 --> 03:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
from existing language
 
03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh but uh but of course now is being
 
03:24:37.590 --> 03:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
extended until the uh the student's 22nd
 
03:24:40.469 --> 03:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
birthday so um i don't know if that's
 
03:24:42.229 --> 03:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
something that um
 
03:24:42.239 --> 03:24:43.510 align:start position:0%
something that um
that

03:24:43.510 --> 03:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:24:47.670 --> 03:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
this committee may want to um look at
 
03:24:49.590 --> 03:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this bill
 
03:24:51.590 --> 03:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
yes representatives
 
03:24:54.309 --> 03:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to cover the grammar point
 
03:24:57.190 --> 03:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
the earlier one 3 and 21 comma inclusive
 
03:24:58.870 --> 03:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
comma is because you're referring to the
 
03:25:01.190 --> 03:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
3 and the 21
 
03:25:04.630 --> 03:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
and 18 and 21 inclusive no comma you're
 
03:25:10.070 --> 03:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:14.630 --> 03:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:16.389 --> 03:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
03:25:18.309 --> 03:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
cordelli do you have thank you
 
03:25:19.910 --> 03:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
just that um
 
03:25:21.110 --> 03:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
as uh
 
03:25:25.030 --> 03:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative luno was um discussing um
 
03:25:28.790 --> 03:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
that uh last part of the amendment um is
 
03:25:31.590 --> 03:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
what is in current statute now so
 
03:25:33.510 --> 03:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering what the
 
03:25:36.150 --> 03:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
what the intent of that meaning is and
 
03:25:36.160 --> 03:25:36.950 align:start position:0%
what the intent of that meaning is and
and

03:25:36.950 --> 03:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:47.510 --> 03:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
while you're looking that up
 
03:25:49.349 --> 03:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
i like to look in the
 
03:25:51.349 --> 03:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
page two of the commission
 
03:25:51.359 --> 03:25:52.870 align:start position:0%
page two of the commission
amendment

03:25:52.870 --> 03:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:25:54.950 --> 03:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh at item d
 
03:25:56.710 --> 03:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
if the medicaid to schools program
 
03:25:59.349 --> 03:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
eligibility extends to students
 
03:26:02.550 --> 03:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
beyond age 21 that would that mean also
 
03:26:06.389 --> 03:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:10.630 --> 03:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:12.469 --> 03:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
would you ask that question again i'm
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
just looking at numbers age 21 would be
 
03:26:14.399 --> 03:26:16.229 align:start position:0%
just looking at numbers age 21 would be
22.

03:26:16.229 --> 03:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
22.
 
03:26:16.239 --> 03:26:17.750 align:start position:0%
22.
yes

03:26:17.750 --> 03:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:26:19.750 --> 03:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
so it would be inclusive so medicaid
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
would continue for that particular
 
03:26:21.600 --> 03:26:22.630 align:start position:0%
would continue for that particular
student

03:26:22.630 --> 03:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
student
 
03:26:25.190 --> 03:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at item d on that page
 
03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:28.710 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at item d on that page
yeah

03:26:28.710 --> 03:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:28.720 --> 03:26:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
but

03:26:29.750 --> 03:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:26:32.710 --> 03:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
the question is if yeah yeah it's an if
 
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh i mean it's a point of study but
 
03:26:37.990 --> 03:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
it does not imply an answer yeah it's a
 
03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:44.710 align:start position:0%
it does not imply an answer yeah it's a
question

03:26:44.710 --> 03:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:47.590 --> 03:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
do we know that if medicaid would extend
 
03:26:49.429 --> 03:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
based upon the way we're writing in the
 
03:26:53.510 --> 03:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:58.319 --> 03:26:59.349 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:26:59.349 --> 03:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:27:01.910 --> 03:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
rick the the woman that testified
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
who wasn't on the hearing when we asked
 
03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
specifically about medicaid
 
03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
on 21 to 22 she said if you change the
 
03:27:09.120 --> 03:27:09.990 align:start position:0%
on 21 to 22 she said if you change the
law

03:27:09.990 --> 03:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:27:12.790 --> 03:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
then it would apply through 22. if we
 
03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
didn't it wouldn't
 
03:27:16.870 --> 03:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's my recollection yeah
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
yeah the the lady who was from the
 
03:27:21.030 --> 03:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
background yeah yeah that was
 
03:27:23.670 --> 03:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:25.510 --> 03:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
represent nelson
 
03:27:28.150 --> 03:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you on page 2
 
03:27:30.630 --> 03:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
line 10 i'm just wondering if there's a
 
03:27:33.190 --> 03:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
problem here i doubt it but and it says
 
03:27:35.590 --> 03:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
a year in which the student reaches 21
 
03:27:39.349 --> 03:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
beyond the student's 21st year of age
 
03:27:41.830 --> 03:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
could that go to 23 24 if it just says
 
03:27:47.510 --> 03:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:49.750 --> 03:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
i mean could that be beyond the could
 
03:27:53.269 --> 03:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
the person be 25 and still get it i'm
 
03:28:00.150 --> 03:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:01.910 --> 03:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's another question it's just things
 
03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
to look at as a right mission
 
03:28:07.910 --> 03:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i read it as the year beyond
 
03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
21 in the school year during which the
 
03:28:13.830 --> 03:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
student turns 21
 
03:28:13.840 --> 03:28:14.710 align:start position:0%
student turns 21
but

03:28:14.710 --> 03:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:28:17.269 --> 03:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
again i think that's
 
03:28:19.590 --> 03:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose of yeah that's the that's
 
03:28:21.030 --> 03:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
the purpose of putting all of these
 
03:28:23.110 --> 03:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
questions together and and being able to
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
come up with answers
 
03:28:27.190 --> 03:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
before we attempt to write
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
statute that
 
03:28:31.030 --> 03:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit the
 
03:28:39.750 --> 03:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:43.990 --> 03:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:52.229 --> 03:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
so so if this committee um passes it and
 
03:28:53.910 --> 03:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's passed on the floor of the house
 
03:28:56.870 --> 03:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's um uh going it's an early bill so
 
03:28:59.429 --> 03:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
it would likely be going to finance
 
03:29:01.030 --> 03:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
um would
 
03:29:01.040 --> 03:29:03.910 align:start position:0%
um would
would

03:29:03.910 --> 03:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:07.269 --> 03:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
would it be possible i guess to um to
 
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
have a more detailed um fiscal note um
 
03:29:13.750 --> 03:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
for for finance
 
03:29:16.150 --> 03:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
that considers
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
not just the um the cost of the local
 
03:29:21.429 --> 03:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
school district
 
03:29:24.229 --> 03:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
and the cost of the state in terms of
 
03:29:26.150 --> 03:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
adequacy grants
 
03:29:26.160 --> 03:29:27.030 align:start position:0%
adequacy grants
and

03:29:27.030 --> 03:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:30.070 --> 03:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
and special education grant but also the
 
03:29:32.070 --> 03:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
costs that may be incurred through the
 
03:29:36.150 --> 03:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
efa program and um and any other costs
 
03:29:37.910 --> 03:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
that that might be relevant because i
 
03:29:39.750 --> 03:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
don't think those are
 
03:29:42.550 --> 03:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
are really um articulated
 
03:29:45.510 --> 03:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
in the um in the note and um
 
03:29:46.870 --> 03:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
it would be um
 
03:29:51.750 --> 03:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
helpful for um for finance when looking
 
03:29:55.349 --> 03:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
at the fiscal impact of this
 
03:29:57.429 --> 03:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
potential policy change
 
03:30:00.150 --> 03:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh to have a more comprehensive
 
03:30:00.160 --> 03:30:02.469 align:start position:0%
uh to have a more comprehensive
fn

03:30:02.469 --> 03:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
fn
 
03:30:04.950 --> 03:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh just in relation to one of the points
 
03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
there um after
 
03:30:09.670 --> 03:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
the discussion yesterday um i conferred
 
03:30:10.870 --> 03:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
with attorney
 
03:30:14.070 --> 03:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
fenton and we agreed that
 
03:30:16.309 --> 03:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
efa students would not be covered under
 
03:30:19.030 --> 03:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
this efa students with disabilities
 
03:30:19.040 --> 03:30:19.910 align:start position:0%
this efa students with disabilities
as

03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:30:23.030 --> 03:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
in lines three and four or except four
 
03:30:24.950 --> 03:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
and five it says
 
03:30:24.960 --> 03:30:26.389 align:start position:0%
and five it says
identified

03:30:26.389 --> 03:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
identified
 
03:30:28.870 --> 03:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
by a school district so they would only
 
03:30:31.830 --> 03:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
be covered if they were using the efa to
 
03:30:34.229 --> 03:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
attend an out of um
 
03:30:37.110 --> 03:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
out of district public school so so
 
03:30:40.950 --> 03:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
follow up on on on that mr chair so so
 
03:30:42.630 --> 03:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
let's just say for the for the point of
 
03:30:45.510 --> 03:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
argument that that that a student was
 
03:30:47.590 --> 03:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
identified by a school district as a
 
03:30:50.309 --> 03:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
child with a disability at age three
 
03:30:51.429 --> 03:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:30:53.590 --> 03:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh and attended that school district and
 
03:30:56.389 --> 03:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
had an iep for a period of time
 
03:30:58.150 --> 03:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
and then withdrew from that school
 
03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
district to open an efa
 
03:31:02.950 --> 03:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:31:07.190 --> 03:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
um and then um uh achieve you know
 
03:31:10.150 --> 03:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
reach the age of 18
 
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:31:11.520 --> 03:31:13.510 align:start position:0%
and um
and

03:31:13.510 --> 03:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:16.469 --> 03:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
decided to homeschool
 
03:31:18.550 --> 03:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh at 18
 
03:31:21.670 --> 03:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
and then read lines 13 to 17 of the
 
03:31:23.429 --> 03:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
cordelia amendment which is largely an
 
03:31:24.950 --> 03:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
03:31:26.389 --> 03:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
where a child with a disability shall
 
03:31:28.389 --> 03:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
include a person between the ages of 18
 
03:31:30.229 --> 03:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
and 21 inclusive
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
who was a um i'm sorry
 
03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
who was identified as a child with a
 
03:31:34.720 --> 03:31:36.229 align:start position:0%
who was identified as a child with a
disability

03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
disability
 
03:31:38.389 --> 03:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
back at age three but did not have an
 
03:31:40.950 --> 03:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
iep at his or her last educational
 
03:31:40.960 --> 03:31:44.309 align:start position:0%
iep at his or her last educational
institution

03:31:44.309 --> 03:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
i i'm just you know i i think
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
and you know this is the this i think is
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
a situation where where where we where
 
03:31:55.269 --> 03:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
the state can get in trouble when we try
 
03:31:57.830 --> 03:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
to rush through um
 
03:31:59.349 --> 03:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
policy changes
 
03:32:01.910 --> 03:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
and i you know you've you've you've
 
03:32:04.950 --> 03:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
obviously heard me and many of us lodge
 
03:32:06.790 --> 03:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
many you know complaints about how the
 
03:32:08.550 --> 03:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
efa program was rushed through the
 
03:32:08.560 --> 03:32:09.590 align:start position:0%
efa program was rushed through the
process

03:32:09.590 --> 03:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:32:11.429 --> 03:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
so we do have policy that has been
 
03:32:14.469 --> 03:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
rushed through the process and now this
 
03:32:14.479 --> 03:32:15.670 align:start position:0%
rushed through the process and now this
um

03:32:15.670 --> 03:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:18.309 --> 03:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
somewhat being being rushed through and
 
03:32:20.950 --> 03:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
how this reads and and i agree i mean
 
03:32:22.469 --> 03:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
i'm glad um
 
03:32:23.990 --> 03:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton
 
03:32:27.510 --> 03:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
was able to to you know conclusively
 
03:32:30.870 --> 03:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
say that that this doesn't apply but but
 
03:32:33.990 --> 03:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
um you know and with all due respect
 
03:32:35.910 --> 03:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
it's not attorneys attorney fentany's
 
03:32:37.830 --> 03:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
call it's a court's call
 
03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
and uh unless the legislative process
 
03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
makes it clear what the legislative
 
03:32:43.190 --> 03:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
intent is
 
03:32:45.590 --> 03:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
um on that which uh which of course we
 
03:32:47.990 --> 03:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
can help do when we write our committee
 
03:32:51.429 --> 03:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
reports and and um and and making floor
 
03:32:53.590 --> 03:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
remarks i don't know if these remarks
 
03:32:53.600 --> 03:32:54.950 align:start position:0%
remarks i don't know if these remarks
actually

03:32:54.950 --> 03:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:32:57.990 --> 03:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know get to legislative intent uh or
 
03:33:01.030 --> 03:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
if attorney fenton's um um remarks could
 
03:33:02.950 --> 03:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
somehow be incorporated into a fiscal
 
03:33:05.190 --> 03:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
note uh which would uh which would
 
03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
certainly indicate which would probably
 
03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
indicate um legislative intent but those
 
03:33:12.389 --> 03:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
those are that that's the concern i have
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
with this type of thing and all the more
 
03:33:15.910 --> 03:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
reason why i think we really need to
 
03:33:21.510 --> 03:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:24.070 --> 03:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
is this really a uh
 
03:33:25.590 --> 03:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
the issue you're looking at here you
 
03:33:28.229 --> 03:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
using the you know the past tense that
 
03:33:28.239 --> 03:33:30.150 align:start position:0%
using the you know the past tense that
was

03:33:30.150 --> 03:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
rather than has or is
 
03:33:32.640 --> 03:33:33.429 align:start position:0%
rather than has or is
um

03:33:33.429 --> 03:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:35.590 --> 03:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
but that that's that's that's you know
 
03:33:38.229 --> 03:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
more of a technical correction it's a
 
03:33:40.469 --> 03:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
policy decision yes but it i don't think
 
03:33:42.710 --> 03:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
it takes a a commission to make that
 
03:33:42.720 --> 03:33:45.750 align:start position:0%
it takes a a commission to make that
change

03:33:45.750 --> 03:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're trying to say
 
03:33:49.190 --> 03:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
though that because of the
 
03:33:51.750 --> 03:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
how fast we've moved everything
 
03:33:54.309 --> 03:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
this year and and the same thing's
 
03:33:55.750 --> 03:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
occurring over there i was just talking
 
03:33:57.990 --> 03:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
to jeff over in ols uh
 
03:34:00.070 --> 03:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
prior to coming here he said just in the
 
03:34:02.070 --> 03:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
last day and a half he's received 80
 
03:34:04.070 --> 03:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
amendment requests
 
03:34:07.429 --> 03:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
and and the day before that he had 113
 
03:34:10.229 --> 03:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
and and so there's it's just
 
03:34:12.870 --> 03:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
they're overloaded as well yeah so so
 
03:34:15.030 --> 03:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
rick i guess what i'm what i'm saying is
 
03:34:15.040 --> 03:34:16.070 align:start position:0%
rick i guess what i'm what i'm saying is
is

03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:34:16.080 --> 03:34:18.070 align:start position:0%
is
um

03:34:18.070 --> 03:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:18.080 --> 03:34:21.670 align:start position:0%
um
there

03:34:21.670 --> 03:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:23.590 --> 03:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
we've we've already sent
 
03:34:23.600 --> 03:34:24.870 align:start position:0%
we've we've already sent
um

03:34:24.870 --> 03:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:24.880 --> 03:34:25.910 align:start position:0%
um
uh

03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:34:30.150 --> 03:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
make sure you get the number right 13 15
 
03:34:33.750 --> 03:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
15 13. we've already sent 1513
 
03:34:37.030 --> 03:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
over to the senate um with it
 
03:34:38.790 --> 03:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
not in its original form but in its
 
03:34:41.510 --> 03:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
amended form um
 
03:34:43.990 --> 03:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
the the the senate can still do what
 
03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
they want with that
 
03:34:46.160 --> 03:34:47.429 align:start position:0%
they want with that
um

03:34:47.429 --> 03:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh and and ultimately i think some of
 
03:34:51.670 --> 03:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
these things are going to go to a
 
03:34:53.349 --> 03:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
committee a conference
 
03:34:56.630 --> 03:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
and um and you know i think
 
03:34:58.309 --> 03:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
you know i think more more more
 
03:35:01.269 --> 03:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
important is that is that we have a uh a
 
03:35:01.279 --> 03:35:02.229 align:start position:0%
important is that is that we have a uh a
study

03:35:02.229 --> 03:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
study
 
03:35:02.239 --> 03:35:05.990 align:start position:0%
study
um

03:35:05.990 --> 03:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:07.910 --> 03:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
attached to uh
 
03:35:11.750 --> 03:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
to 394 in its current form um
 
03:35:11.760 --> 03:35:12.870 align:start position:0%
to 394 in its current form um
uh

03:35:12.870 --> 03:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:17.110 --> 03:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
then it is bringing 394 back to 1513's
 
03:35:17.120 --> 03:35:18.229 align:start position:0%
then it is bringing 394 back to 1513's
original

03:35:18.229 --> 03:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
original
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh form and uh and it may end up
 
03:35:23.190 --> 03:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
there and i think there's enough sort of
 
03:35:25.349 --> 03:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
policy out there
 
03:35:27.750 --> 03:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
with this with the senate having 1513
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they can they can put it back into
 
03:35:31.269 --> 03:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
its original form
 
03:35:31.279 --> 03:35:32.229 align:start position:0%
its original form
uh

03:35:32.229 --> 03:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
and then it can be ironed out i guess in
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
a in a conference report but but that
 
03:35:39.910 --> 03:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
would at least give give the um
 
03:35:42.950 --> 03:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
give a little a little bit more time to
 
03:35:45.910 --> 03:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh to really understand what the um
 
03:35:47.910 --> 03:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
you know what new hampshire's
 
03:35:47.920 --> 03:35:50.070 align:start position:0%
you know what new hampshire's
compliance

03:35:50.070 --> 03:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
03:35:52.389 --> 03:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
issue is
 
03:35:54.229 --> 03:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
represent cordelia
 
03:35:57.510 --> 03:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes i i would um i guess disagree
 
03:36:00.309 --> 03:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
slightly in that i i think that um it is
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
imperative that we uh
 
03:36:06.469 --> 03:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
include the um 1513 original language
 
03:36:07.750 --> 03:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
in this
 
03:36:10.710 --> 03:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
and get this passed
 
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
when i left the senate
 
03:36:14.160 --> 03:36:15.510 align:start position:0%
when i left the senate
education

03:36:15.510 --> 03:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:36:15.520 --> 03:36:16.870 align:start position:0%
education
yesterday

03:36:16.870 --> 03:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
03:36:19.030 --> 03:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
when they ended their
 
03:36:22.870 --> 03:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
exec session um they were held off on
 
03:36:22.880 --> 03:36:24.630 align:start position:0%
exec session um they were held off on
1513

03:36:24.630 --> 03:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
1513
 
03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
um they had one amendment planning which
 
03:36:29.590 --> 03:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure was but they were awaiting
 
03:36:32.550 --> 03:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment by senator khan
 
03:36:34.229 --> 03:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
as well and i'm not sure if they're
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to take that up today or or next
 
03:36:38.790 --> 03:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
week um but i think it's imperative that
 
03:36:41.429 --> 03:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
um we at least move forward with the um
 
03:36:45.510 --> 03:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
original 1513 language
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
do you know this is the amendment i i do
 
03:36:50.870 --> 03:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
not know what they were planning or what
 
03:36:52.630 --> 03:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
senator khan was planning to say down
 
03:36:56.389 --> 03:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
it's close to what i was given the other
 
03:36:58.319 --> 03:36:59.190 align:start position:0%
it's close to what i was given the other
day

03:36:59.190 --> 03:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:37:02.790 --> 03:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
and when i spoke i don't think they've
 
03:37:08.070 --> 03:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
taken up that other amendment yet
 
03:37:08.080 --> 03:37:08.870 align:start position:0%
taken up that other amendment yet
no

03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
that 1513 is still very much in their
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
possession i believe that they're acting
 
03:37:18.150 --> 03:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:25.830 --> 03:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:28.389 --> 03:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
the commission study for me
 
03:37:30.389 --> 03:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
is not a bad idea but i think it's too
 
03:37:32.070 --> 03:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
much i think there's some stuff in there
 
03:37:34.870 --> 03:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
that i think is needs a a different way
 
03:37:36.630 --> 03:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
of addressing
 
03:37:38.790 --> 03:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
the issue of catastrophic aid i think is
 
03:37:38.800 --> 03:37:41.110 align:start position:0%
the issue of catastrophic aid i think is
huge

03:37:41.110 --> 03:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
huge
 
03:37:41.120 --> 03:37:42.870 align:start position:0%
huge
and

03:37:42.870 --> 03:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:44.550 --> 03:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
i think it gets away from this issue of
 
03:37:44.560 --> 03:37:46.070 align:start position:0%
i think it gets away from this issue of
21

03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
21
 
03:37:48.070 --> 03:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
22. yes represent woodcock thank you
 
03:37:49.990 --> 03:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
just a question i'm not sure if
 
03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:51.030 align:start position:0%
just a question i'm not sure if
um

03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative rosenberg from the
 
03:37:53.040 --> 03:37:54.070 align:start position:0%
representative rosenberg from the
disability

03:37:54.070 --> 03:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
disability
 
03:37:55.990 --> 03:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
has the answer or we do i just want to
 
03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
muddy up the waters representative
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
nelson made me think of that
 
03:38:02.309 --> 03:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
on section e uh bill will you talk about
 
03:38:03.990 --> 03:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
how far the age could go
 
03:38:05.750 --> 03:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
um i was wondering
 
03:38:08.710 --> 03:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
i was trying to recall that at one point
 
03:38:12.790 --> 03:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
when a student became 22
 
03:38:15.030 --> 03:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
i thought they transitioned to the
 
03:38:18.710 --> 03:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative services program
 
03:38:18.720 --> 03:38:19.429 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative services program
no

03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
from high school
 
03:38:23.030 --> 03:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
no i don't know if he will let you come
 
03:38:26.070 --> 03:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
on up and and uh
 
03:38:32.150 --> 03:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:32.160 --> 03:38:34.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:38:34.469 --> 03:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:35.670 --> 03:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
yes voila
 
03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
i'm karen rosenberg with the disability
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
rights center and i'd be happy to do my
 
03:38:40.469 --> 03:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
best to answer your questions i don't
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
want to mind any further but uh nelson
 
03:38:44.389 --> 03:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
brought up and then my brain went back
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
to olden days i thought at the end of 21
 
03:38:49.590 --> 03:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
when the youngster turned 22 in school
 
03:38:51.670 --> 03:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
that he was transitioned to
 
03:38:54.309 --> 03:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative services well no not
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily so there are some students
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
who may be eligible who may be receiving
 
03:39:01.510 --> 03:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
special education because they have
 
03:39:03.429 --> 03:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities or acquired
 
03:39:06.070 --> 03:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
brain injuries and they
 
03:39:07.830 --> 03:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
might be eligible for services through
 
03:39:09.750 --> 03:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
our area agencies but that's only a
 
03:39:13.030 --> 03:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
small sector of the students who are
 
03:39:15.349 --> 03:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
eligible for special education you might
 
03:39:17.510 --> 03:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
have other students who don't who aren't
 
03:39:20.229 --> 03:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
able to graduate in high school in four
 
03:39:22.389 --> 03:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
years for other reasons you know perhaps
 
03:39:24.389 --> 03:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
they had emotional disabilities that
 
03:39:25.830 --> 03:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
required them to be out of school for a
 
03:39:28.309 --> 03:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
long time for example and we don't have
 
03:39:30.550 --> 03:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
a sim a system like that that will
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
provide really robust services for them
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
so you have to kind of think about the
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
full range
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
of students
 
03:39:37.830 --> 03:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's probably more often than not you
 
03:39:39.110 --> 03:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
would have students with developmental
 
03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities who aren't graduating on
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
time but not
 
03:39:44.550 --> 03:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
not all of the time okay they answered
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
my question thank you very much
 
03:39:49.189 --> 03:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
that may be the case but in fact
 
03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
we're not providing any adequacy dollars
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
for those students that's coming from a
 
03:39:57.189 --> 03:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
different source right so for the
 
03:39:58.630 --> 03:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
students who are
 
03:40:00.150 --> 03:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
getting receiving services through the
 
03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
area agency system those are for
 
03:40:03.910 --> 03:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
services that are not education services
 
03:40:05.429 --> 03:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
that would be the responsibility of the
 
03:40:07.510 --> 03:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
school district so they might get
 
03:40:10.229 --> 03:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
respite services um there's sort of a
 
03:40:11.990 --> 03:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
dispute about when those services when
 
03:40:13.990 --> 03:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
some of the services have to kick in but
 
03:40:15.670 --> 03:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
from our perspective that would include
 
03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
other kinds of services that aren't
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
educational in nature so for example if
 
03:40:21.830 --> 03:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
a student can receive their free
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education in the
 
03:40:26.870 --> 03:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
regular public school but they have and
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
do just fine and they but they need
 
03:40:30.309 --> 03:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
services at home that that would be the
 
03:40:32.229 --> 03:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the area agency if
 
03:40:33.990 --> 03:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
they needed you know some
 
03:40:35.349 --> 03:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
other kinds of services at home that
 
03:40:37.189 --> 03:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
aren't necessary for them to succeed in
 
03:40:37.199 --> 03:40:38.389 align:start position:0%
aren't necessary for them to succeed in
school

03:40:38.389 --> 03:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:40:39.910 --> 03:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
but like i said it's not every student
 
03:40:43.349 --> 03:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for those services
 
03:40:43.359 --> 03:40:44.550 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for those services
yeah

03:40:44.550 --> 03:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:40:46.469 --> 03:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
any further questions thank you very
 
03:40:48.710 --> 03:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
much yes representative
 
03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
thought you were asking
 
03:40:52.309 --> 03:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
for after i don't not really sure who to
 
03:40:52.319 --> 03:40:53.349 align:start position:0%
for after i don't not really sure who to
answer

03:40:53.349 --> 03:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
answer
 
03:40:55.110 --> 03:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
of so
 
03:40:57.510 --> 03:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
03:41:00.389 --> 03:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
if we pass the
 
03:41:03.990 --> 03:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
amount the sue's amendment
 
03:41:06.150 --> 03:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
to get more information
 
03:41:08.790 --> 03:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
and we don't pass
 
03:41:11.590 --> 03:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment that puts it the way the
 
03:41:11.600 --> 03:41:12.790 align:start position:0%
the amendment that puts it the way the
federal

03:41:12.790 --> 03:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:41:17.030 --> 03:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:19.750 --> 03:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:22.790 --> 03:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
held off those lawsuits or are we then
 
03:41:25.030 --> 03:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
going to get those lawsuits does anybody
 
03:41:29.030 --> 03:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:31.269 --> 03:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
are you asking me that or i'm asking
 
03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
anybody and so if you know if
 
03:41:37.990 --> 03:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
if we don't do anything it stays at 21
 
03:41:39.830 --> 03:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
like we have right now in law
 
03:41:42.790 --> 03:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
right but if we do this
 
03:41:45.510 --> 03:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
all i'm saying is if we do the sue's
 
03:41:45.520 --> 03:41:46.870 align:start position:0%
all i'm saying is if we do the sue's
amendment

03:41:46.870 --> 03:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:41:48.790 --> 03:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
without you know that we're looking into
 
03:41:51.429 --> 03:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
this it says we're looking into this
 
03:41:53.510 --> 03:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
and we don't pass
 
03:41:53.520 --> 03:41:55.349 align:start position:0%
and we don't pass
yet

03:41:55.349 --> 03:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
yet
 
03:41:57.349 --> 03:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
are we still going to be hit with they
 
03:41:59.110 --> 03:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
said that there were two lawsuits
 
03:41:59.120 --> 03:42:01.030 align:start position:0%
said that there were two lawsuits
pending

03:42:01.030 --> 03:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
pending
 
03:42:03.110 --> 03:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
is that showing that we're doing enough
 
03:42:04.630 --> 03:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
towards that
 
03:42:07.189 --> 03:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
to hold off those amendments or are we
 
03:42:09.510 --> 03:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
going to be hit unless we
 
03:42:13.349 --> 03:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:14.870 --> 03:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
does anybody know
 
03:42:16.870 --> 03:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
i mean i can tell you that there has
 
03:42:16.880 --> 03:42:17.670 align:start position:0%
i mean i can tell you that there has
been

03:42:17.670 --> 03:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of there there have been there's
 
03:42:21.269 --> 03:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
been development
 
03:42:22.790 --> 03:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
in thinking about these lawsuits so i
 
03:42:24.790 --> 03:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
think there are there are law firms who
 
03:42:24.800 --> 03:42:25.830 align:start position:0%
think there are there are law firms who
are

03:42:25.830 --> 03:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:42:27.670 --> 03:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
con you know compiling evidence and
 
03:42:30.550 --> 03:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
considering this and um so i think the
 
03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
state is at risk
 
03:42:33.910 --> 03:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
um if it doesn't bring itself into
 
03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
compliance and
 
03:42:37.349 --> 03:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
that just the rhode island decision is
 
03:42:39.830 --> 03:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
actually a it was a court of appeals the
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
first circuit which is the court of
 
03:42:44.229 --> 03:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
appeals for new hampshire so it's
 
03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
controlling law in the state you know is
 
03:42:48.790 --> 03:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
there a hundred percent certain to
 
03:42:52.710 --> 03:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
certainty that um if people plaintiffs
 
03:42:54.229 --> 03:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
brought that lawsuit that they would win
 
03:42:56.630 --> 03:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
there's never 100 uncertainty right but
 
03:42:59.030 --> 03:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
i think that it would be a pretty
 
03:43:01.750 --> 03:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
labor-intensive discovery intensive
 
03:43:01.760 --> 03:43:02.790 align:start position:0%
labor-intensive discovery intensive
lawsuit

03:43:02.790 --> 03:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
03:43:04.150 --> 03:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
well so you
 
03:43:06.150 --> 03:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
are aware of some of those do you think
 
03:43:08.229 --> 03:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
they would hold off
 
03:43:09.429 --> 03:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
if we
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
appeared to be looking at how to do this
 
03:43:15.030 --> 03:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
or would i i only i i don't think that i
 
03:43:18.150 --> 03:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
have the i just wondered so beyond me
 
03:43:19.750 --> 03:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
03:43:19.760 --> 03:43:21.189 align:start position:0%
that's fine
yeah

03:43:21.189 --> 03:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:43:22.870 --> 03:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
my crystal ball like just i'd have
 
03:43:24.630 --> 03:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
dropped it
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
represented boom
 
03:43:28.389 --> 03:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i don't have any
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
questions now i'm just one there's only
 
03:43:32.469 --> 03:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
one amendment on the floor one four
 
03:43:35.110 --> 03:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
seven that's right and i think we should
 
03:43:36.790 --> 03:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
finish that before we go on anything
 
03:43:39.670 --> 03:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
else also has to time
 
03:43:43.189 --> 03:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
we last year we passed this bill it got
 
03:43:45.030 --> 03:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
lost somewhere in the senate so we've
 
03:43:47.590 --> 03:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
had plenty of time working on this
 
03:43:50.070 --> 03:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to pass this
 
03:43:53.429 --> 03:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
amendment and then go on and if somebody
 
03:43:55.349 --> 03:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
can bring up with another amendment
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay that's exactly what we
 
03:43:59.670 --> 03:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
need to do representative mullen could i
 
03:44:02.150 --> 03:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
just ask one more muddying question and
 
03:44:05.590 --> 03:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
that is the effectiveness date of
 
03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli's amendment
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:19.269 --> 03:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
it's 2023 correct
 
03:44:19.279 --> 03:44:20.309 align:start position:0%
it's 2023 correct
yes

03:44:20.309 --> 03:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:44:24.150 --> 03:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:26.229 --> 03:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
are you done with me thank you very much
 
03:44:30.630 --> 03:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:33.910 --> 03:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
just a quick question um do how long has
 
03:44:36.950 --> 03:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
the um the inclusive language been in um
 
03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
03:44:40.309 --> 03:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
and glenn had it up there just a little
 
03:44:42.830 --> 03:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
a moment ago so i'm
 
03:44:48.550 --> 03:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:53.189 --> 03:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
or or maybe maybe becky wilson
 
03:44:53.199 --> 03:44:55.510 align:start position:0%
or or maybe maybe becky wilson
knows

03:44:55.510 --> 03:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
knows
 
03:44:56.950 --> 03:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
looking for how long the inclusive
 
03:45:00.150 --> 03:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
language has existed in federal law
 
03:45:04.150 --> 03:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:06.630 --> 03:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
um so the last time idea was
 
03:45:09.510 --> 03:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
reauthorized was in 2004
 
03:45:11.910 --> 03:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
so it may have been there before 2004
 
03:45:14.309 --> 03:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
but at least since 2004 the language has
 
03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
been there the lawsuit that folks are
 
03:45:18.790 --> 03:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the first circuit decision
 
03:45:21.030 --> 03:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
was in 2018
 
03:45:22.309 --> 03:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
interpreting what that meant and then
 
03:45:23.670 --> 03:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
there was another lawsuit out of
 
03:45:25.189 --> 03:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
connecticut it started in connecticut
 
03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
went to the second circuit and that i
 
03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
believe was 2021 when that was decided
 
03:45:31.590 --> 03:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
does that help you
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
sure it it definitely does so the the um
 
03:45:37.189 --> 03:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
the the federal language has been in
 
03:45:37.199 --> 03:45:38.070 align:start position:0%
the the federal language has been in
there

03:45:38.070 --> 03:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:45:41.670 --> 03:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
since at least 2004 and the um the the
 
03:45:43.429 --> 03:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
first circuit court of appeals decision
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
was 2018 in the rhode island case so
 
03:45:48.469 --> 03:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
again that's been out there for so it's
 
03:45:49.590 --> 03:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
been out there
 
03:45:51.429 --> 03:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
right and then connecticut with 2021 and
 
03:45:53.429 --> 03:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
there's i went out of hawaii as well and
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
i don't recall what year that was
 
03:45:56.710 --> 03:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
decided and
 
03:45:57.750 --> 03:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:45:59.910 --> 03:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
did the lawsuits generate that are
 
03:46:01.429 --> 03:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
generated out in
 
03:46:02.950 --> 03:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
rhode island
 
03:46:05.830 --> 03:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
a result of rhode island department of
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
education messing with this and changing
 
03:46:11.830 --> 03:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
it from 21 22 or 21 through the end of
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
the semester or
 
03:46:15.670 --> 03:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
no i think it's just the opposite i
 
03:46:17.510 --> 03:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
think what happened i think what started
 
03:46:19.670 --> 03:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
this was i think maybe it was i think it
 
03:46:22.150 --> 03:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
was hawaii that brought the first case
 
03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
and when the state actually lowered the
 
03:46:28.150 --> 03:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
eligibility age in that state and then
 
03:46:30.229 --> 03:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
there was a lawsuit brought to challenge
 
03:46:32.550 --> 03:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
that and to have the court and it went
 
03:46:34.229 --> 03:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
to the ninth circuit court of appeals to
 
03:46:37.510 --> 03:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
look at what um you know whether they
 
03:46:39.429 --> 03:46:39.439 align:start position:0%
were allowed to take advantage of that
 
03:46:41.670 --> 03:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
exemption from serving 21 inclusive or
 
03:46:44.950 --> 03:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
not and then hawaii ended up losing
 
03:46:44.960 --> 03:46:45.670 align:start position:0%
not and then hawaii ended up losing
and

03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:47.590 --> 03:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
which established in hawaii anyway it
 
03:46:49.670 --> 03:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
had 21 inclusive was what the law was
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
because of these three factors
 
03:46:53.590 --> 03:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
operating an adult education program you
 
03:46:54.870 --> 03:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
know exactly what we talked about here
 
03:46:56.710 --> 03:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
what attorney bond was talking about
 
03:46:58.630 --> 03:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
with you at the hearing
 
03:47:01.269 --> 03:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
so and then following that lawsuits were
 
03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
filed in these other states
 
03:47:05.830 --> 03:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
maine for example just didn't they
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
basically just saw the first circuit
 
03:47:08.550 --> 03:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
decision and then
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
changed it on their own
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
and i think a lot of other states
 
03:47:14.790 --> 03:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
already had been serving kids
 
03:47:17.349 --> 03:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
through their 21st year
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you okay jennifer did that occur
 
03:47:20.790 --> 03:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
when you were an attorney for the
 
03:47:26.229 --> 03:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:26.239 --> 03:47:28.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:47:28.950 --> 03:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:41.429 --> 03:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:55.990 --> 03:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:56.000 --> 03:48:22.389 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:48:22.389 --> 03:48:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:22.399 --> 03:48:23.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:48:30.950 --> 03:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
but it still doesn't solve the problem
 
03:48:36.630 --> 03:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
of the kid being dropped mid-year
 
03:48:39.750 --> 03:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
all this talk that we're doing now and
 
03:48:41.349 --> 03:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
the problem that
 
03:48:43.510 --> 03:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
that we had that we wanted to solve
 
03:48:47.269 --> 03:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:47.279 --> 03:48:48.070 align:start position:0%
 
ralph

03:48:48.070 --> 03:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
ralph
 
03:48:51.110 --> 03:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so we move it so they turn 22 in
 
03:48:52.710 --> 03:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
the middle of the year so then when we
 
03:48:54.150 --> 03:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
make it so next year we're working on
 
03:48:58.229 --> 03:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
the build so 22 and then 23 and then 24.
 
03:49:00.550 --> 03:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
no i mean we've got to be a cut off
 
03:49:03.510 --> 03:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere and the cutoff is
 
03:49:05.590 --> 03:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
when they meet hit
 
03:49:08.469 --> 03:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
21 at the end of age 21
 
03:49:11.670 --> 03:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's planning you know it's not just
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know so just like anything when i
 
03:49:13.920 --> 03:49:14.710 align:start position:0%
you know so just like anything when i
hit

03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
hit
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
65 i'm on medicare you know i don't have
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
any choice so i mean it's the same thing
 
03:49:20.399 --> 03:49:24.070 align:start position:0%
any choice so i mean it's the same thing
so

03:49:24.070 --> 03:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:25.750 --> 03:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay when
 
03:49:27.910 --> 03:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
except we're talking about
 
03:49:29.110 --> 03:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
young people
 
03:49:30.710 --> 03:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
that are
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
needing services and
 
03:49:36.229 --> 03:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
in school and suddenly not in school and
 
03:49:39.030 --> 03:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
maybe not understanding why and
 
03:49:40.710 --> 03:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
03:49:43.030 --> 03:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
i know i know it's complex i just feel
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
bad that we can't solve the problem that
 
03:49:46.630 --> 03:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
we were trying to solve
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay after all this talk we tried i know
 
03:49:52.870 --> 03:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
i know
 
03:49:55.670 --> 03:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
this this uh is going to keep going here
 
03:49:57.750 --> 03:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's in the senate right now it's going
 
03:49:59.750 --> 03:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
to go to several other committees so
 
03:50:01.189 --> 03:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
those who really want to get on top of
 
03:50:04.389 --> 03:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
this and keep working on it work at it
 
03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:05.760 align:start position:0%

in this live
 
03:50:44.070 --> 03:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
lapse that we have time we have could i
 
03:50:45.429 --> 03:50:45.439 align:start position:0%
ask a question
 
03:50:47.510 --> 03:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
that i've held off asking while we
 
03:50:49.030 --> 03:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
talked about these very important
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
matters of the legalities and so forth
 
03:50:56.710 --> 03:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
but how do we describe a 21 year old
 
03:51:00.150 --> 03:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
person as a child
 
03:51:02.870 --> 03:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
is that a legal fiction or i don't mean
 
03:51:05.189 --> 03:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
to be disrespectful i just don't
 
03:51:07.750 --> 03:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
understand how at some point that
 
03:51:11.189 --> 03:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
termination terminology doesn't change
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
to person or student or something else
 
03:51:16.150 --> 03:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
there ought to be something in there i
 
03:51:19.110 --> 03:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
can envision as a person who once was an
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
aide to a male child
 
03:51:24.550 --> 03:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
in secondary school
 
03:51:27.110 --> 03:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
and that person would stand up and walk
 
03:51:29.189 --> 03:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
around the wall room
 
03:51:31.590 --> 03:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
pulled the shades on the things in the
 
03:51:34.229 --> 03:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
school and the teacher did her best
 
03:51:37.110 --> 03:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
to keep the class on target
 
03:51:39.189 --> 03:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
but he was totally disruptive and i
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
can't imagine what would have happened
 
03:51:42.830 --> 03:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
had he been
 
03:51:45.830 --> 03:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
21. i could not have controlled it i can
 
03:51:48.070 --> 03:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
answer the question i got a 51 year old
 
03:51:48.080 --> 03:51:50.070 align:start position:0%
answer the question i got a 51 year old
child

03:51:50.070 --> 03:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:51:52.469 --> 03:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:51:55.750 --> 03:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's very subjective term
 
03:51:57.189 --> 03:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
03:51:58.950 --> 03:51:58.960 align:start position:0%

04:03:38.150 --> 04:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
at various times in our history here and
 
04:03:41.349 --> 04:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
the bill further goes on and adds in
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
part two
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
the accountability for these grants
 
04:03:48.309 --> 04:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
and the accountability language is
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
exactly the same accountability that
 
04:03:53.590 --> 04:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
came out of task force for 2018.
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
those are the changes
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
to uh that are incorporated within this
 
04:04:02.950 --> 04:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:08.070 --> 04:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:08.080 --> 04:04:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
questions

04:04:09.110 --> 04:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:04:09.120 --> 04:04:10.710 align:start position:0%
questions
comments

04:04:10.710 --> 04:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
comments
 
04:04:11.910 --> 04:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
04:04:13.510 --> 04:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
04:04:15.990 --> 04:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair so so the
 
04:04:19.349 --> 04:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
way i understand
 
04:04:19.359 --> 04:04:27.269 align:start position:0%
way i understand
1381

04:04:27.269 --> 04:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:29.990 --> 04:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
that that that essentially lines five
 
04:04:32.309 --> 04:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
through um
 
04:04:36.870 --> 04:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:39.429 --> 04:04:39.439 align:start position:0%
are the the grant that's in 420 as it
 
04:04:41.269 --> 04:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
comes over to us
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
and what's been added is
 
04:04:44.640 --> 04:04:46.630 align:start position:0%
and what's been added is
section

04:04:46.630 --> 04:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:04:46.640 --> 04:04:48.389 align:start position:0%
section
2.

04:04:48.389 --> 04:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
2.
 
04:04:50.309 --> 04:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
which representative ladd talks about as
 
04:04:53.189 --> 04:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
the accountability
 
04:04:53.199 --> 04:04:54.389 align:start position:0%
the accountability
section

04:04:54.389 --> 04:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:04:55.670 --> 04:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's correct correct so i'm getting
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
getting this right and um
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
and so what the what the what the
 
04:05:03.269 --> 04:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
accountability part is doing in section
 
04:05:03.279 --> 04:05:04.150 align:start position:0%
accountability part is doing in section
two

04:05:04.150 --> 04:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:05:07.030 --> 04:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
is basically saying
 
04:05:10.229 --> 04:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
if you're a poor district
 
04:05:12.309 --> 04:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
meaning you've got not a lot of property
 
04:05:12.319 --> 04:05:13.830 align:start position:0%
meaning you've got not a lot of property
value

04:05:13.830 --> 04:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
value
 
04:05:15.590 --> 04:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
and you've got
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
poor families
 
04:05:21.189 --> 04:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
then before we give you any more money
 
04:05:22.710 --> 04:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to tell us exactly
 
04:05:25.110 --> 04:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
how you're going to use use this money
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
so if you're from a wealthy district or
 
04:05:28.790 --> 04:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
from a district that doesn't have a lot
 
04:05:32.469 --> 04:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
of poor kids um you can um you can go
 
04:05:34.630 --> 04:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
ahead and use your state grant however
 
04:05:36.309 --> 04:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
you want go ahead and use your local
 
04:05:38.309 --> 04:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
dollars however you want but if you're
 
04:05:40.950 --> 04:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
poor poor you better you better show us
 
04:05:43.429 --> 04:05:43.439 align:start position:0%
what you're what you're doing here and
 
04:05:46.229 --> 04:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
and you know um represent vlad
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:51.670 --> 04:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
two three years ago and we had a we had
 
04:05:54.389 --> 04:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
a similar um conversation when it came
 
04:05:56.070 --> 04:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
to accountability
 
04:05:57.910 --> 04:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think it was really clear
 
04:05:59.429 --> 04:05:59.439 align:start position:0%
at that time that
 
04:06:01.189 --> 04:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
accountability really should apply to
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
everybody and not just apply to
 
04:06:05.990 --> 04:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
districts that are poor
 
04:06:07.990 --> 04:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
like like you know without a lot of
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
property value like like let's say you
 
04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
know newport
 
04:06:15.269 --> 04:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
and um and districts that have a lot of
 
04:06:19.429 --> 04:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
poor people um in it and uh and you know
 
04:06:21.590 --> 04:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
what i have to take a look if they fall
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
into that category
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:06:28.389 --> 04:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
um because there was a
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that came with
 
04:06:30.800 --> 04:06:34.710 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that came with
420

04:06:34.710 --> 04:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
i'm just not thought i'm finding it
 
04:06:40.229 --> 04:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:41.590 --> 04:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
no no no
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
before i pick on somebody yeah so so yes
 
04:06:45.830 --> 04:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
so newport newport's one of the
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
districts that would receive the grant
 
04:06:50.309 --> 04:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
that that uh i i mean i just think
 
04:06:50.319 --> 04:06:51.590 align:start position:0%
that that uh i i mean i just think
that's

04:06:51.590 --> 04:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:06:54.870 --> 04:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
there's just a lack of fairness um there
 
04:06:57.349 --> 04:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
to to say that if you're if you're from
 
04:06:59.349 --> 04:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
a poor district and you're a poor kid
 
04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
then you better be showing me how you're
 
04:07:03.750 --> 04:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
using the the extraordinary what's
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
called extraordinary need grant so
 
04:07:07.670 --> 04:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's extraordinary need but before we
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
give you that grant
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
you got to show us exactly how you're
 
04:07:12.870 --> 04:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
going to do it i you know
 
04:07:16.710 --> 04:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
i i i think the bill was good as it came
 
04:07:18.790 --> 04:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
from the senate i think it can be
 
04:07:21.990 --> 04:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
improved but i don't think um
 
04:07:25.269 --> 04:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
with all due respect 1381 um i don't
 
04:07:26.790 --> 04:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
think that improves it i think some of
 
04:07:28.630 --> 04:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
your other um
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
i think another one of your amendments
 
04:07:32.870 --> 04:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative ladd did did actually
 
04:07:32.880 --> 04:07:34.229 align:start position:0%
representative ladd did did actually
improve

04:07:34.229 --> 04:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
improve
 
04:07:36.229 --> 04:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
um the bill may not have made it perfect
 
04:07:38.630 --> 04:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
but uh but you know send it in the right
 
04:07:41.110 --> 04:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
direction but it wasn't uh 1381 thank
 
04:07:41.120 --> 04:07:42.389 align:start position:0%
direction but it wasn't uh 1381 thank
you

04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:07:44.469 --> 04:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
04:07:49.510 --> 04:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
i just have a question because this
 
04:07:51.470 --> 04:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
often comes up when
 
04:07:51.480 --> 04:07:52.870 align:start position:0%
often comes up when
[Music]

04:07:52.870 --> 04:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:07:54.149 --> 04:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
is generous with some new funds that go
 
04:07:59.110 --> 04:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
back to towns and cities there's usually
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
a debate well is this going to go into
 
04:08:01.199 --> 04:08:02.469 align:start position:0%
a debate well is this going to go into
programs

04:08:02.469 --> 04:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
and teachers or is it going to go back
 
04:08:06.389 --> 04:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayers
 
04:08:09.910 --> 04:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering under this um
 
04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
to help with the trophy tax burden so
 
04:08:14.710 --> 04:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
under the provisions of this amendment
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
if a district
 
04:08:19.510 --> 04:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
chose to take this money and use it to
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
reduce property taxes by returning it to
 
04:08:24.950 --> 04:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers would they then not get
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:33.030 --> 04:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
this money uh um
 
04:08:33.040 --> 04:08:33.990 align:start position:0%
this money uh um
is

04:08:33.990 --> 04:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:08:35.429 --> 04:08:35.439 align:start position:0%
funds which comes down through your
 
04:08:38.710 --> 04:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding formula
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
i would hope they would not use it to
 
04:08:41.670 --> 04:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:08:43.510 --> 04:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
do what you're saying that they use it
 
04:08:46.149 --> 04:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
towards education but this is the same
 
04:08:48.389 --> 04:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
way this would be used the same way that
 
04:08:51.189 --> 04:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
our fiscal capacity disparity aid money
 
04:08:53.590 --> 04:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
has been used in in the past
 
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's the same it would be used in the
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
same manner that came out of that
 
04:08:58.830 --> 04:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
funding study back in 2008
 
04:08:58.840 --> 04:09:00.710 align:start position:0%
funding study back in 2008
2009

04:09:00.710 --> 04:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
2009
 
04:09:03.670 --> 04:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
it would it does require that you submit
 
04:09:06.389 --> 04:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
a plan how you're going to try to
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
improve education
 
04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
for what you are supposed to use this
 
04:09:12.630 --> 04:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
money towards
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
and you will also be required to show
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
results and achievement results to the
 
04:09:16.640 --> 04:09:18.149 align:start position:0%
results and achievement results to the
department

04:09:18.149 --> 04:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:09:18.159 --> 04:09:21.189 align:start position:0%
department
annually

04:09:21.189 --> 04:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:26.790 --> 04:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
this is not the money that everybody
 
04:09:29.110 --> 04:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
gets this is the money that only the
 
04:09:31.269 --> 04:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
poor poor districts get
 
04:09:32.469 --> 04:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
so no
 
04:09:34.870 --> 04:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
you're not going to say everybody has to
 
04:09:37.269 --> 04:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
submit this plan not everybody gets this
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
money so this is money over and above
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
what everybody else gets and
 
04:09:45.429 --> 04:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
what we want them to do with it is
 
04:09:46.950 --> 04:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
something that's going to help those
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
poor kids do better in education and so
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's the point of the accountability
 
04:09:53.590 --> 04:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's don't just
 
04:09:55.510 --> 04:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
spend it on whatever spend it on
 
04:09:56.710 --> 04:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
something that's going to help those
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
kids we keep saying how are we going to
 
04:10:02.070 --> 04:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
help the poor kids well just giving
 
04:10:03.349 --> 04:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
money without
 
04:10:03.359 --> 04:10:05.269 align:start position:0%
money without
any

04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:10:05.279 --> 04:10:07.189 align:start position:0%
any
plan

04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
is is
 
04:10:10.870 --> 04:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
may help the kids may not we don't know
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
where it's going to go so the school has
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
to say yes we have a plan for helping
 
04:10:19.189 --> 04:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
those very kids that this is money for i
 
04:10:22.550 --> 04:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
think that's perfectly reasonable to try
 
04:10:28.070 --> 04:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:30.630 --> 04:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
04:10:32.790 --> 04:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair no and i i
 
04:10:34.710 --> 04:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate that i mean i think
 
04:10:37.590 --> 04:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
um uh from the from the standpoint of
 
04:10:39.030 --> 04:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
the um i mean remember there's two
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
factors involved here there's um there's
 
04:10:43.030 --> 04:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer because it's got a
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
valuation component to it and there's
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the free and reduced price lunch
 
04:10:50.710 --> 04:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh count which which which talks about
 
04:10:53.429 --> 04:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh which is basically a proxy for uh for
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
families that uh
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
that that live in poverty and um
 
04:11:01.110 --> 04:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
and and so so i think in all fairness to
 
04:11:03.269 --> 04:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
representative porter's question given
 
04:11:05.269 --> 04:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
that part of this is really tied to a
 
04:11:08.229 --> 04:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
community's res wealth resource that
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
that reducing
 
04:11:12.710 --> 04:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
using it to to reduce the local property
 
04:11:15.189 --> 04:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
tax burden in some instances may be the
 
04:11:17.429 --> 04:11:17.439 align:start position:0%
right thing to do i want to point out
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
also that in house bill 2 2.
 
04:11:22.630 --> 04:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
there was a grant called the reductio
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
called the
 
04:11:26.389 --> 04:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
swept reduction supplemental payment
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
and and it came in at 15.2 million
 
04:11:31.269 --> 04:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
dollars so about a million dollars more
 
04:11:33.750 --> 04:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
than the extraordinary need grant and
 
04:11:36.070 --> 04:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
this went to and i've got the list here
 
04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
but i got a squint to read it
 
04:11:39.269 --> 04:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
i did make a few comments it went to
 
04:11:39.279 --> 04:11:40.469 align:start position:0%
i did make a few comments it went to
alton

04:11:40.469 --> 04:11:40.479 align:start position:0%
alton
 
04:11:42.630 --> 04:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
it went to bartlett
 
04:11:45.269 --> 04:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
it went to bridgewater
 
04:11:47.110 --> 04:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
it went to
 
04:11:49.830 --> 04:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
carroll it went to center harbor and i
 
04:11:51.510 --> 04:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
could go on and on
 
04:11:53.990 --> 04:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
i went to about 15 16 different
 
04:11:55.990 --> 04:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
communities including wolfeboro
 
04:11:59.349 --> 04:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
moultonborough tuftonboro rye newcastle
 
04:11:59.359 --> 04:12:01.110 align:start position:0%
moultonborough tuftonboro rye newcastle
newington

04:12:01.110 --> 04:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
newington
 
04:12:03.189 --> 04:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
and there was no accountability placed
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
on them in terms of how to use that
 
04:12:09.110 --> 04:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
state grant of 15.2 million dollars um
 
04:12:10.950 --> 04:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
so these wealthy communities no
 
04:12:12.790 --> 04:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
accountability for using the grant so
 
04:12:14.950 --> 04:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
not everybody got that grant just the
 
04:12:17.670 --> 04:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
just these wealthy communities yet for
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
these poor communities oh no we need to
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
know exactly how they're going to use
 
04:12:23.189 --> 04:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
this grant so that's what i'm talking
 
04:12:26.870 --> 04:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
about fairness and i think overall
 
04:12:28.870 --> 04:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
we should have a more robust
 
04:12:31.590 --> 04:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
accountability clause when it comes to
 
04:12:35.269 --> 04:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
our adequate education grant and um and
 
04:12:36.309 --> 04:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
04:12:37.910 --> 04:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
think that's something that i know
 
04:12:39.269 --> 04:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
that's something that we're going to be
 
04:12:42.149 --> 04:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
looking at in the 1680 study and which
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
was part of
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
a significant part of of house bill 1680
 
04:12:49.269 --> 04:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
so i do take accountability seriously
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
but i don't take accountability as a as
 
04:12:54.710 --> 04:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
a measure that we only foist upon um
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
communities that
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
that have extraordinary
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh needs
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
04:13:04.389 --> 04:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:13:04.399 --> 04:13:06.149 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:06.159 --> 04:13:09.189 align:start position:0%
um
it's

04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:09.199 --> 04:13:10.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:13.030 --> 04:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
lucas made some comments that
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
have me really concerned because the
 
04:13:15.359 --> 04:13:16.870 align:start position:0%
have me really concerned because the
assumption

04:13:16.870 --> 04:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
04:13:18.309 --> 04:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
seems to be
 
04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
that a poor community
 
04:13:23.429 --> 04:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
and a struggling school is not doing
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
everything it possibly can to help the
 
04:13:27.189 --> 04:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
children learn
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
the teachers the administrators
 
04:13:37.110 --> 04:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
the special ed teams and all those in
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
poor schools work just as hard
 
04:13:41.910 --> 04:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that all the
 
04:13:43.349 --> 04:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
children learn
 
04:13:47.110 --> 04:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
as those in the richer districts
 
04:13:50.550 --> 04:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
the issues that they're trying to work
 
04:13:50.560 --> 04:13:51.830 align:start position:0%
the issues that they're trying to work
with

04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:13:54.389 --> 04:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
are far beyond what can be met
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
making these poor communities
 
04:14:01.600 --> 04:14:03.030 align:start position:0%
making these poor communities
justify

04:14:03.030 --> 04:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
justify
 
04:14:05.670 --> 04:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
how they're using extra money to help
 
04:14:05.680 --> 04:14:06.870 align:start position:0%
how they're using extra money to help
them

04:14:06.870 --> 04:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:14:09.750 --> 04:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
improve things
 
04:14:12.630 --> 04:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
is insulting in my opinion
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
to those communities because you're
 
04:14:14.239 --> 04:14:15.110 align:start position:0%
to those communities because you're
saying

04:14:15.110 --> 04:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
well you must be doing everything wrong
 
04:14:19.349 --> 04:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
because you're poor
 
04:14:21.269 --> 04:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
and you're poor so i want you to prove
 
04:14:23.590 --> 04:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
to me that you know how to do it the way
 
04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
the rich communities do it you know how
 
04:14:28.070 --> 04:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
to do it the way the other schools are
 
04:14:30.389 --> 04:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
doing it obviously
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
you're poor so you must be doing
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
something wrong and i and i take real
 
04:14:37.269 --> 04:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
exception to that and i am offended by
 
04:14:37.279 --> 04:14:38.070 align:start position:0%
exception to that and i am offended by
that

04:14:38.070 --> 04:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:47.429 --> 04:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield thank you
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
i was going to direct it to the chair
 
04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
but he's handed over the gavel um i just
 
04:14:53.349 --> 04:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
have to say that i've sat through
 
04:14:55.030 --> 04:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
several executive sessions with this
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
committee now it's been very difficult
 
04:15:00.070 --> 04:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
and it's extremely disappointing to hear
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
the manipulation of the words and how
 
04:15:05.590 --> 04:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
they're twisted time and time again
 
04:15:07.670 --> 04:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
we're saying okay to 14 million dollars
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
that we may not necessarily agree with
 
04:15:11.429 --> 04:15:11.439 align:start position:0%
but we're saying that there needs to be
 
04:15:13.429 --> 04:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
some accountability you know what maybe
 
04:15:15.189 --> 04:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
it wasn't done that way in the past just
 
04:15:17.750 --> 04:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
because it was done that way in the past
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it right but i can't help
 
04:15:22.469 --> 04:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
but wonder did all of this nonsense with
 
04:15:24.870 --> 04:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
the words go on years ago when there
 
04:15:26.950 --> 04:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
weren't cameras because we're all on the
 
04:15:29.349 --> 04:15:29.359 align:start position:0%
same team i know every single person in
 
04:15:32.070 --> 04:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
this room cares about the kids i see it
 
04:15:33.750 --> 04:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
you hit the desk you hit the desk with
 
04:15:36.149 --> 04:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
your passion i know alicia cares i know
 
04:15:37.830 --> 04:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
you care
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
can't we just stick to to what what
 
04:15:42.550 --> 04:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about at hand and not
 
04:15:44.389 --> 04:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
not the volume with the words because i
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:51.189 --> 04:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you represent tanner
 
04:15:52.229 --> 04:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
and um you know words matter i guess is
 
04:15:56.950 --> 04:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
probably where i'll come down on that
 
04:15:56.960 --> 04:15:57.830 align:start position:0%
probably where i'll come down on that
one

04:15:57.830 --> 04:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:15:59.670 --> 04:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:16:02.630 --> 04:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
accountability is important and this
 
04:16:04.149 --> 04:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
04:16:04.159 --> 04:16:05.349 align:start position:0%
this particular
um

04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:07.269 --> 04:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
amendment outlines a lot of
 
04:16:09.269 --> 04:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
accountability for these people
 
04:16:12.630 --> 04:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
these schools that are
 
04:16:15.670 --> 04:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
poor schools i guess we'll call them um
 
04:16:15.680 --> 04:16:16.790 align:start position:0%
poor schools i guess we'll call them um
through

04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:16:19.269 --> 04:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
the the oversight of the department of
 
04:16:22.070 --> 04:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
education and in identifying the program
 
04:16:23.510 --> 04:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
and plans
 
04:16:25.990 --> 04:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
then to
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
have an assessment either a statewide
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
assessment or some way of improving
 
04:16:32.870 --> 04:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
instruction and learning identifying
 
04:16:34.950 --> 04:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
pupils learning range
 
04:16:37.030 --> 04:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be
 
04:16:40.229 --> 04:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
something that
 
04:16:42.229 --> 04:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
you know measures student academic
 
04:16:42.239 --> 04:16:43.510 align:start position:0%
you know measures student academic
achievement

04:16:43.510 --> 04:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
04:16:46.469 --> 04:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
and as representative porter said um and
 
04:16:49.590 --> 04:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
i think part of the issue is that
 
04:16:51.910 --> 04:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of us have worked in schools and
 
04:16:53.990 --> 04:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
we've worked in schools and we've worked
 
04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
have a lot of resources because of the
 
04:17:03.030 --> 04:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
local property taxes and the property
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
base and some of them
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
that we've worked with
 
04:17:08.550 --> 04:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
have not and we know what the difference
 
04:17:08.560 --> 04:17:09.830 align:start position:0%
have not and we know what the difference
is

04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
and it's not that people aren't trying
 
04:17:13.910 --> 04:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
or that people don't have
 
04:17:15.910 --> 04:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
plans or people aren't
 
04:17:18.309 --> 04:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
trying to develop programs
 
04:17:19.670 --> 04:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
to help kids
 
04:17:19.680 --> 04:17:20.950 align:start position:0%
to help kids
um

04:17:20.950 --> 04:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:22.870 --> 04:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
04:17:25.590 --> 04:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
adding this particular accountability we
 
04:17:27.910 --> 04:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
don't add this to charter schools
 
04:17:30.070 --> 04:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
we don't add this to efa programs or
 
04:17:32.469 --> 04:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
prenda or micro schools
 
04:17:34.630 --> 04:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
we don't even have any kind of
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
accountability for home school and yet
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know because uh we have
 
04:17:43.429 --> 04:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
the ability to give some extra money
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
to some of these schools to give this
 
04:17:45.359 --> 04:17:46.630 align:start position:0%
to some of these schools to give this
grant

04:17:46.630 --> 04:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
grant
 
04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden we've got more
 
04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
accountability here than i've seen for a
 
04:17:51.670 --> 04:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of things that we've done
 
04:17:53.269 --> 04:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
04:17:56.070 --> 04:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i think it's um
 
04:17:58.469 --> 04:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
as representative porter said and i know
 
04:18:00.630 --> 04:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
teachers who teach in newport
 
04:18:03.510 --> 04:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
teachers who teach at curesarge
 
04:18:04.950 --> 04:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
and that's a
 
04:18:06.870 --> 04:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
real rich district versus a real poor
 
04:18:06.880 --> 04:18:08.229 align:start position:0%
real rich district versus a real poor
district

04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:18:09.990 --> 04:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
that those teachers are trying as hard
 
04:18:13.030 --> 04:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
as they can and that they teach
 
04:18:15.830 --> 04:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
because they want the kids to succeed
 
04:18:18.630 --> 04:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes at this level and one of
 
04:18:20.469 --> 04:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
the reasons i'm here
 
04:18:21.990 --> 04:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
is because when i'm teaching i thought
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
it was at this level
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
decisions were made
 
04:18:29.189 --> 04:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
that put politics into into my classroom
 
04:18:31.030 --> 04:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
that made it more difficult for me to
 
04:18:31.040 --> 04:18:31.990 align:start position:0%
that made it more difficult for me to
teach

04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
teach
 
04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
and didn't affect the student
 
04:18:33.600 --> 04:18:34.950 align:start position:0%
and didn't affect the student
achievement

04:18:34.950 --> 04:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:18:39.349 --> 04:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think this accountability
 
04:18:41.910 --> 04:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
is is too binding
 
04:18:46.149 --> 04:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
and on some level insulting to um
 
04:18:47.590 --> 04:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
to some of these schools that are going
 
04:18:50.550 --> 04:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
to get it and i think it also could be
 
04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
a way to say well we've we give them
 
04:18:54.469 --> 04:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
money and nothing changes you know
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's another thing i've heard
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
is that you can't just throw money
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
towards education and
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
and uh make a difference and
 
04:19:04.870 --> 04:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
it makes a difference i don't care what
 
04:19:05.990 --> 04:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
you say
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
the schools that have the resources
 
04:19:10.950 --> 04:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
have better student achievement than
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
schools that don't have the resources
 
04:19:15.670 --> 04:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
and until we address the school funding
 
04:19:15.680 --> 04:19:16.550 align:start position:0%
and until we address the school funding
issue

04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:19:19.030 --> 04:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
on the basis of school performance
 
04:19:22.950 --> 04:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
rather than on property tax base
 
04:19:25.429 --> 04:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
you know nothing's really going to be
 
04:19:27.590 --> 04:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
changed a whole lot
 
04:19:28.630 --> 04:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative hopson
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you for
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:19:37.030 --> 04:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
you know i i have a question about what
 
04:19:37.040 --> 04:19:37.910 align:start position:0%
you know i i have a question about what
is

04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh school success
 
04:19:42.389 --> 04:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
because i i can't figure out if we're
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
measuring school success by the amount
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
of money that you spend on a student or
 
04:19:49.830 --> 04:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
what their grades are because
 
04:19:52.469 --> 04:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
my town doesn't qualify for any of this
 
04:19:55.349 --> 04:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
aid but yet my elementary school went
 
04:19:59.429 --> 04:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
from number 58 to number 122.
 
04:20:01.349 --> 04:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
so could someone explain that to me
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
maybe you mr chair
 
04:20:04.790 --> 04:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
04:20:08.070 --> 04:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
just um and on what basis was that
 
04:20:10.790 --> 04:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
drop in from one thing to the other what
 
04:20:13.110 --> 04:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
was it that was the ranking the state
 
04:20:16.149 --> 04:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
ranking of the ranking based on what
 
04:20:19.269 --> 04:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
on the doe what i i don't know based on
 
04:20:22.389 --> 04:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
what how does the how does the doe rank
 
04:20:26.389 --> 04:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
schools on testing
 
04:20:28.950 --> 04:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
and growth
 
04:20:28.960 --> 04:20:29.990 align:start position:0%
and growth
um

04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:32.229 --> 04:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:20:34.469 --> 04:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative woodcock thank
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
you so i'm sorry
 
04:20:38.149 --> 04:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
president uh
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
well yes this is edification not a it's
 
04:20:42.550 --> 04:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
not a point of uh
 
04:20:44.149 --> 04:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
just a point of information
 
04:20:46.469 --> 04:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:20:47.670 --> 04:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you just the point of
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
information if you can so the this grant
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
is going to change
 
04:20:53.910 --> 04:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
the i understand all right change the
 
04:20:56.710 --> 04:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
formula so it becomes an annual
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
the increase of the annual
 
04:21:01.349 --> 04:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
it's not a one-time funding
 
04:21:04.149 --> 04:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
that's just a question
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to find a loophole trying to
 
04:21:07.269 --> 04:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
answer it
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
i think that's a i think that's correct
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
this is a grant it's not a continuous
 
04:21:17.670 --> 04:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's there for fy23 and fy24 if you look
 
04:21:19.269 --> 04:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
at the fiscal note you'll see it drops
 
04:21:22.149 --> 04:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
from 14 to 9 million dollars right um
 
04:21:25.349 --> 04:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
it's uh based upon uh demographics
 
04:21:25.359 --> 04:21:27.110 align:start position:0%
it's uh based upon uh demographics
population

04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh something that we've had
 
04:21:33.110 --> 04:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's been a fiscal capacity disparity
 
04:21:34.389 --> 04:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
a type
 
04:21:37.830 --> 04:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
grant awarded
 
04:21:39.910 --> 04:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
for as long as i can recall being in
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
this house
 
04:21:42.950 --> 04:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
we've had something there similar to
 
04:21:45.750 --> 04:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
this it's much like we have some federal
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
money that comes down to us through the
 
04:21:49.510 --> 04:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
elementary secondary education act which
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
is designed
 
04:21:52.229 --> 04:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
years ago used to call it title two
 
04:21:54.149 --> 04:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
money and the money which we used for
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
remediation in schools which we're
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
acquired to and it went to schools
 
04:22:00.309 --> 04:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
normally in my districts or where i was
 
04:22:01.990 --> 04:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
that were those districts there's a
 
04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
direct correlation between achievement
 
04:22:06.630 --> 04:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
and the level of
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
economics within your community
 
04:22:10.630 --> 04:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
and in the communities which are
 
04:22:12.790 --> 04:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
receiving this there's a high incidence
 
04:22:15.110 --> 04:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
of needs for achievement especially in
 
04:22:15.120 --> 04:22:15.830 align:start position:0%
of needs for achievement especially in
the

04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
sub-components so groups within
 
04:22:20.469 --> 04:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
which we're not seeing that going on now
 
04:22:22.630 --> 04:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
in order for us in this state to really
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
show growth and achievement the way we
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
do we do need to have some methodology
 
04:22:29.670 --> 04:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
in ascertaining we do that sort of
 
04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
through the statewide assessment but
 
04:22:33.910 --> 04:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
this also allows through this language
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
right here that you may do it through
 
04:22:38.309 --> 04:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
your local assessment to ascertain
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
whether this is being used or whether
 
04:22:41.910 --> 04:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
you're accomplishing what you need to
 
04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
accomplish much like the feds ask us on
 
04:22:46.229 --> 04:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
elementary secondary education act when
 
04:22:48.630 --> 04:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
we receive those funds for remediation
 
04:22:50.550 --> 04:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i was just asking because
 
04:22:52.229 --> 04:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
a look at line 30 we're talking about
 
04:22:56.710 --> 04:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:58.870 --> 04:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to align itself with the
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
annual funding and not just a one-time
 
04:23:00.479 --> 04:23:01.429 align:start position:0%
annual funding and not just a one-time
grant

04:23:01.429 --> 04:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
grant
 
04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's why i was questioning that thank
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
you yeah um
 
04:23:06.389 --> 04:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
maybe representative vlad
 
04:23:09.670 --> 04:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
recalls i think uh several terms ago
 
04:23:12.149 --> 04:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
um i think you were involved in a in
 
04:23:15.750 --> 04:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that tried to um put some
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
accountability to the
 
04:23:20.790 --> 04:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
special needs differentiated aid to see
 
04:23:23.269 --> 04:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
where that money was going and what
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
happened with that
 
04:23:27.429 --> 04:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
um is that am i correct i can't remember
 
04:23:28.870 --> 04:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
the number of the bill but it had to do
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
with uh differentiated that component of
 
04:23:35.590 --> 04:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
where we have if you are a third grader
 
04:23:37.349 --> 04:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
and you're eligible
 
04:23:39.670 --> 04:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
because of your level of achievement and
 
04:23:41.429 --> 04:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
your statewide assessment reflects that
 
04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
you're not proficient but not receiving
 
04:23:45.670 --> 04:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
any other component in differentiated
 
04:23:48.790 --> 04:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
free and reduced
 
04:23:53.030 --> 04:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
those areas english language learner
 
04:23:55.990 --> 04:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
then you qualified we tried to establish
 
04:23:58.229 --> 04:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
some kind of a system for
 
04:23:58.239 --> 04:23:59.429 align:start position:0%
some kind of a system for
uh

04:23:59.429 --> 04:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
trying to identify whether those dollars
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
they're a small significant amount of
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
money it was somewhere around 600 bucks
 
04:24:07.510 --> 04:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
at that time per per pupil
 
04:24:09.349 --> 04:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
and we were trying to ascertain is this
 
04:24:11.110 --> 04:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
really doing anything
 
04:24:13.189 --> 04:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
and the only way of doing it was to
 
04:24:16.229 --> 04:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
track that same cohort of students but
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
it was just a one-time contribution of
 
04:24:20.149 --> 04:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
money and as you couldn't do that you
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't track the cohort as they went
 
04:24:24.469 --> 04:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
up through to see if this was making a
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
difference or not
 
04:24:27.990 --> 04:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have any real good methodology
 
04:24:29.429 --> 04:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
for us
 
04:24:31.269 --> 04:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
ascertaining whether in fact we are
 
04:24:31.279 --> 04:24:32.149 align:start position:0%
ascertaining whether in fact we are
seeing

04:24:32.149 --> 04:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
04:24:34.389 --> 04:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
achievement and especially growth uh
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
other than our statewide assessment and
 
04:24:38.950 --> 04:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know i know that i am the cro i know
 
04:24:41.110 --> 04:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
that i'm not really in infatuate
 
04:24:44.070 --> 04:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
infatuated with the that methodology for
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
determining growth uh there's other ways
 
04:24:48.070 --> 04:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
of doing that
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
um but that's not part of this
 
04:24:49.680 --> 04:24:53.990 align:start position:0%
um but that's not part of this
discussion

04:24:53.990 --> 04:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair so um
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
so just for um uh
 
04:25:00.550 --> 04:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
just for
 
04:25:02.550 --> 04:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know potentially technical support
 
04:25:05.590 --> 04:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
on on the comment i'm i'm going to make
 
04:25:07.910 --> 04:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
um we do have mark manginello here from
 
04:25:09.429 --> 04:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
the from the department who i think
 
04:25:11.910 --> 04:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
created the fiscal note i'm sure
 
04:25:14.469 --> 04:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
on um on this bill but also has
 
04:25:18.149 --> 04:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
extensive um background in
 
04:25:19.990 --> 04:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
and rick and i work very closely with
 
04:25:22.469 --> 04:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
mark and mickey on house bill 709
 
04:25:25.510 --> 04:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 and so so i think he
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
understands very much what what goes
 
04:25:31.590 --> 04:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
into the um the not only the the
 
04:25:34.149 --> 04:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
educational uh the adequate education
 
04:25:36.389 --> 04:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
grant which this is not actually part of
 
04:25:38.070 --> 04:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's in the same section but it's not an
 
04:25:41.429 --> 04:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant um and um and
 
04:25:43.349 --> 04:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
also in the greater cons in the greater
 
04:25:46.070 --> 04:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
context of what a uh what a district
 
04:25:46.080 --> 04:25:47.189 align:start position:0%
context of what a uh what a district
spends

04:25:47.189 --> 04:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
spends
 
04:25:49.030 --> 04:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
to to educate
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
their students and while i'm while i'm
 
04:25:53.830 --> 04:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
here not trying to make people feel too
 
04:25:53.840 --> 04:25:54.870 align:start position:0%
here not trying to make people feel too
bad

04:25:54.870 --> 04:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
bad
 
04:25:56.550 --> 04:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to stop picking on manchester
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
and start picking on hillsboro a little
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
bit i'm glad marjorie's back and back in
 
04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
the room
 
04:26:03.910 --> 04:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
because i think this is going to help
 
04:26:06.229 --> 04:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
also you know address what we're trying
 
04:26:09.349 --> 04:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
to accomplish here again i do support
 
04:26:12.070 --> 04:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
420 as it came over uh from the senate
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
and i understand this committee looks
 
04:26:14.399 --> 04:26:15.590 align:start position:0%
and i understand this committee looks
very

04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:26:18.070 --> 04:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
provides substantial weight on what we
 
04:26:19.990 --> 04:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
receive from the uh from the senate i'm
 
04:26:22.309 --> 04:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
being a little facetious there
 
04:26:22.319 --> 04:26:23.030 align:start position:0%
being a little facetious there
but

04:26:23.030 --> 04:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:26:26.710 --> 04:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
but what what 420 does for um for
 
04:26:26.720 --> 04:26:27.990 align:start position:0%
but what what 420 does for um for
hillsboro

04:26:27.990 --> 04:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
hillsboro
 
04:26:31.030 --> 04:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
is in the first year gives hillsborough
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
a little over 159 thousand dollars in
 
04:26:37.269 --> 04:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
the second year a little over 120 uh 5
 
04:26:37.279 --> 04:26:38.469 align:start position:0%
the second year a little over 120 uh 5
000

04:26:38.469 --> 04:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
000
 
04:26:40.710 --> 04:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
and um and
 
04:26:42.790 --> 04:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
and so put that in the context of a
 
04:26:45.189 --> 04:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
couple things uh first of all what
 
04:26:47.110 --> 04:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
hillsborough's total school budget is
 
04:26:49.269 --> 04:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
for approximately the thousand kids or
 
04:26:52.070 --> 04:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
1100 kids that hillsborough does i don't
 
04:26:54.469 --> 04:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
really know but i'm guessing it's 20 21
 
04:26:56.389 --> 04:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
million dollars 22 million dollars
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that in that ballpark so
 
04:27:01.269 --> 04:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
this is 159
 
04:27:01.279 --> 04:27:02.550 align:start position:0%
this is 159
000

04:27:02.550 --> 04:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
000
 
04:27:04.229 --> 04:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
and and also
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
at that at that spending level
 
04:27:10.389 --> 04:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
at hillsborough hillsborough's average
 
04:27:13.110 --> 04:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
student is is achieving at about the
 
04:27:16.149 --> 04:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
15th percentile 20th percentile
 
04:27:19.030 --> 04:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
statewide so so 50th percentile is
 
04:27:20.950 --> 04:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
obviously state average so they're well
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
below state i'm not trying to make you
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
feel bad uh marjorie because your
 
04:27:26.950 --> 04:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
teachers and the families are trying as
 
04:27:31.269 --> 04:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
hard as they can um to um uh to to
 
04:27:33.590 --> 04:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
provide a strong education for their
 
04:27:36.070 --> 04:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
kids in fact hillsboro and hopkinton
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
used to be
 
04:27:37.199 --> 04:27:38.389 align:start position:0%
used to be
rivals

04:27:38.389 --> 04:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
rivals
 
04:27:41.429 --> 04:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
on um on the um playing field and now
 
04:27:44.870 --> 04:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
we're allies on the in many sports
 
04:27:48.149 --> 04:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
and and have a terrific um um
 
04:27:51.030 --> 04:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
association together but um but mr chair
 
04:27:53.030 --> 04:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
actually uh representative lad i'm
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
really trying to figure out how much you
 
04:27:54.960 --> 04:27:56.030 align:start position:0%
really trying to figure out how much you
expect

04:27:56.030 --> 04:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
expect
 
04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
159 thousand dollars
 
04:28:01.269 --> 04:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
on top of hillsborough's 22 million
 
04:28:04.630 --> 04:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
dollar budget to move that needle from
 
04:28:06.870 --> 04:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
from current achievement at the 15th
 
04:28:10.070 --> 04:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
percentile to
 
04:28:11.670 --> 04:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
to anything else
 
04:28:13.990 --> 04:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
so and um
 
04:28:18.309 --> 04:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:21.429 --> 04:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:23.910 --> 04:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
since 1970
 
04:28:27.349 --> 04:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
we have quadrupled and that's factoring
 
04:28:27.359 --> 04:28:28.550 align:start position:0%
we have quadrupled and that's factoring
in

04:28:28.550 --> 04:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:28:28.560 --> 04:28:30.870 align:start position:0%
in
uh

04:28:30.870 --> 04:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:32.149 --> 04:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
the value of
 
04:28:33.910 --> 04:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
the money
 
04:28:35.990 --> 04:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
quadrupled the amount of money that we
 
04:28:37.990 --> 04:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
have spent on
 
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
education and yet our outcomes are
 
04:28:45.510 --> 04:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
straight they're aligned
 
04:28:47.670 --> 04:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
and if you look at a map if you look at
 
04:28:49.590 --> 04:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
a graph of
 
04:28:51.590 --> 04:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of money each
 
04:28:53.990 --> 04:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
state pays per pupil
 
04:28:54.000 --> 04:28:55.590 align:start position:0%
state pays per pupil
versus

04:28:55.590 --> 04:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
versus
 
04:28:57.830 --> 04:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
the outcomes it's like somebody threw a
 
04:29:00.149 --> 04:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
piece of sand on a piece of paper there
 
04:29:03.269 --> 04:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
is no correlation whatsoever between the
 
04:29:04.389 --> 04:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
money spent
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
and the outcome and as long as we keep
 
04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
looking at just spend more money spend
 
04:29:11.830 --> 04:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
more money and don't look at
 
04:29:14.309 --> 04:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
what are the underlying issues
 
04:29:14.319 --> 04:29:15.670 align:start position:0%
what are the underlying issues
why

04:29:15.670 --> 04:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:29:17.670 --> 04:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
are we still with all the money we've
 
04:29:17.680 --> 04:29:18.469 align:start position:0%
are we still with all the money we've
spent

04:29:18.469 --> 04:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
spent
 
04:29:20.790 --> 04:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
in the last 50 years
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
why have our outcomes not improved
 
04:29:26.950 --> 04:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's clearly not money it's something
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
else and as long as we keep looking at
 
04:29:31.030 --> 04:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
money we're never going to find what
 
04:29:33.670 --> 04:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
that something else is
 
04:29:33.680 --> 04:29:34.870 align:start position:0%
that something else is
yes

04:29:34.870 --> 04:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:29:37.429 --> 04:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
we may be near the top in the
 
04:29:37.439 --> 04:29:38.469 align:start position:0%
we may be near the top in the
federal

04:29:38.469 --> 04:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
federal
 
04:29:40.389 --> 04:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
you know rankings
 
04:29:42.710 --> 04:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
but our students still are not that
 
04:29:42.720 --> 04:29:44.070 align:start position:0%
but our students still are not that
proficient

04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
proficient
 
04:29:46.630 --> 04:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
and many of our students like you said
 
04:29:46.640 --> 04:29:48.550 align:start position:0%
and many of our students like you said
15

04:29:48.550 --> 04:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
15
 
04:29:50.710 --> 04:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
but if money if as long as we keep say
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
well let's give this money and just give
 
04:29:54.790 --> 04:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
this money
 
04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to pull them up
 
04:29:59.910 --> 04:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
we need to figure out what the problem
 
04:30:03.349 --> 04:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
is and solve the problem not just do the
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
money and so perhaps
 
04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
with this little bit of accountability
 
04:30:10.630 --> 04:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
that says what was your plan and how did
 
04:30:13.269 --> 04:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
you do we might find
 
04:30:15.269 --> 04:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
that one school does come up with
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
something that you know what this works
 
04:30:19.670 --> 04:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
and then we can spread that across all
 
04:30:21.990 --> 04:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
the schools but as long as we just give
 
04:30:24.149 --> 04:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
money and don't ask what are you doing
 
04:30:27.030 --> 04:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
with it and did it help how are we going
 
04:30:33.189 --> 04:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:34.950 --> 04:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
would would you like to start and then
 
04:30:36.870 --> 04:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
represent tanner thank you very much mr
 
04:30:39.349 --> 04:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
chair so so um
 
04:30:39.359 --> 04:30:40.870 align:start position:0%
chair so so um
so

04:30:40.870 --> 04:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:41.750 --> 04:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
the adage is money does not buy
 
04:30:46.389 --> 04:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
happiness i get that and and we see that
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
all the time money does not necessarily
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
always buy results it depends on how
 
04:30:54.389 --> 04:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
it's spent the department of education
 
04:30:56.870 --> 04:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
has a tremendous amount of information
 
04:31:00.229 --> 04:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
on how districts spend their money and
 
04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure mark would be able to uh to
 
04:31:04.870 --> 04:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
talk about that if if there was a
 
04:31:07.510 --> 04:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
question that came up on that what the
 
04:31:10.389 --> 04:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
school funding commission uh learned is
 
04:31:13.189 --> 04:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
that there is a very strong correlation
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
between student outcomes and um and
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
poverty and student outcomes and lack of
 
04:31:22.950 --> 04:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
resources and and so so
 
04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
the better resourced districts do have
 
04:31:28.389 --> 04:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
much stronger student outcomes than the
 
04:31:30.870 --> 04:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
less resource districts and then i'd go
 
04:31:33.510 --> 04:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
further on to say when you took a look
 
04:31:37.750 --> 04:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
took a take a look at um at the um you
 
04:31:40.870 --> 04:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
know course the programs the study um at
 
04:31:43.990 --> 04:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh at a lot of um uh you know at a at a
 
04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
s at a school like saint paul's or
 
04:31:48.790 --> 04:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
phillips exeter obviously you know those
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
schools have have straight tuition that
 
04:31:53.830 --> 04:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
is probably three times the average of
 
04:31:56.550 --> 04:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
what we're uh what we're spending here
 
04:31:59.429 --> 04:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh on our on on an average pub public
 
04:31:59.439 --> 04:32:00.550 align:start position:0%
uh on our on on an average pub public
school

04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:32:03.429 --> 04:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so so i guess what i'm
 
04:32:05.349 --> 04:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is no there's we have a
 
04:32:08.070 --> 04:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
lot of data on what schools how schools
 
04:32:10.710 --> 04:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
are spending money what their outcomes
 
04:32:14.229 --> 04:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
are and um and that can certainly be uh
 
04:32:19.590 --> 04:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
be correlated with um uh with with with
 
04:32:19.600 --> 04:32:20.469 align:start position:0%
be correlated with um uh with with with
the

04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:32:22.309 --> 04:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
number of eligible free and reduced
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
price lunch kids which which sort of
 
04:32:27.990 --> 04:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
tracks poverty in an area or val or um
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
assessed valuation uh per pupil which is
 
04:32:32.710 --> 04:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
also a number that uh
 
04:32:34.870 --> 04:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
that we have so i would certainly
 
04:32:37.110 --> 04:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
recommend you know people taking a look
 
04:32:40.070 --> 04:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
at the um the commission report which uh
 
04:32:42.229 --> 04:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
which unpacked a lot of that uh
 
04:32:45.030 --> 04:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
information and i think dispels a lot of
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
the um the sort of the wisdom that the
 
04:32:50.710 --> 04:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
conventional wisdom that that people may
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
may bring bring to bear saying oh no you
 
04:32:54.630 --> 04:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
spend more money on schools and it
 
04:32:57.429 --> 04:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't um uh go anywhere because at the
 
04:32:58.870 --> 04:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
end of the day
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
what's uh what's really important and
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
none of these bills that we've looked at
 
04:33:02.640 --> 04:33:03.830 align:start position:0%
none of these bills that we've looked at
today

04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:33:05.750 --> 04:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
certainly 420 doesn't
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's it does some good things but it
 
04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%
doesn't separate out the two the two
 
04:33:13.510 --> 04:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
functions of costing and education and
 
04:33:15.990 --> 04:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
then funding in education costing what
 
04:33:17.990 --> 04:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
an adequate education is is different
 
04:33:20.470 --> 04:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
than fund then making sure a district
 
04:33:23.670 --> 04:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
has access to the resources they need to
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh to pay for it and
 
04:33:28.869 --> 04:33:28.879 align:start position:0%
and the the cost of an adequate
 
04:33:30.789 --> 04:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
education the way it's defined in
 
04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
current law the way that 420
 
04:33:36.109 --> 04:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
essentially continues it is a
 
04:33:36.119 --> 04:33:37.910 align:start position:0%
essentially continues it is a
one-size-fits-all

04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all
 
04:33:39.949 --> 04:33:39.959 align:start position:0%
proposition and the fact we don't have
 
04:33:42.869 --> 04:33:42.879 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all communities in
 
04:33:46.709 --> 04:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so um so what 420 does in
 
04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
the very positive side is recognize that
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
different communities have different um
 
04:33:55.109 --> 04:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
resources available to them through
 
04:33:57.269 --> 04:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
their assessed valuation and different
 
04:34:00.150 --> 04:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
communities have different cost factors
 
04:34:02.869 --> 04:34:02.879 align:start position:0%
associated with inadequate education as
 
04:34:05.189 --> 04:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
as determined by the um the free and
 
04:34:08.551 --> 04:34:08.561 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch uh piece of of 420.
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
it still blends them together but um but
 
04:34:15.510 --> 04:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh it it it does i think follow some of
 
04:34:17.590 --> 04:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
the some of the tenants that the school
 
04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
funding commission found and that's the
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
reason i support and and i'm i'm quite
 
04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
certain the reason why uh why senator
 
04:34:27.830 --> 04:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
waters senator khan when they were here
 
04:34:27.840 --> 04:34:28.629 align:start position:0%
waters senator khan when they were here
both

04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
both
 
04:34:30.709 --> 04:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
both indicated their support um
 
04:34:32.789 --> 04:34:32.799 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support for senator
 
04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%

bill here i didn't hear any of them air
 
04:34:39.830 --> 04:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
support for uh for stringent
 
04:34:42.629 --> 04:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
accountability measures um
 
04:34:42.639 --> 04:34:43.910 align:start position:0%
accountability measures um
um

04:34:43.910 --> 04:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:47.269 --> 04:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
but um but anyway the the um
 
04:34:49.910 --> 04:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know the the
 
04:34:52.709 --> 04:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
school funding needs to be some school
 
04:34:55.590 --> 04:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
costing and funding need uh need to be
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
looked at i think very closely uh here
 
04:35:01.029 --> 04:35:01.039 align:start position:0%
and um and you know 420 is a
 
04:35:03.269 --> 04:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
a starting point that can at least be
 
04:35:06.629 --> 04:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
put in place to help
 
04:35:11.029 --> 04:35:11.039 align:start position:0%
fy i think 23 is part of this yep um
 
04:35:14.230 --> 04:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
july 1st 2022 is the effective date so
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
um to help uh to help out in the next
 
04:35:18.150 --> 04:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
couple of years thank you
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
very much thank you um i'm looking at
 
04:35:23.590 --> 04:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
the estimated uh
 
04:35:27.109 --> 04:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
summary of adequacy aid for fy23 for our
 
04:35:27.119 --> 04:35:28.310 align:start position:0%
summary of adequacy aid for fy23 for our
state

04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:35:30.310 --> 04:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at the amount of money
 
04:35:33.750 --> 04:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
which we're allocating towards fnr
 
04:35:36.390 --> 04:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
which is 82.4 million dollars
 
04:35:38.709 --> 04:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
what we are doing with this type of uh
 
04:35:40.869 --> 04:35:40.879 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity aid we're also
 
04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
and that's based upon
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
that is based upon your your poverty
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
level the the the uh
 
04:35:49.830 --> 04:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
money that i'm talking about that 82.4
 
04:35:49.840 --> 04:35:51.109 align:start position:0%
money that i'm talking about that 82.4
million

04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:35:52.949 --> 04:35:52.959 align:start position:0%
i'm also looking at this equalized
 
04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
property valuation per pupil which is
 
04:35:56.230 --> 04:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
also based upon
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
level of poverty within communities
 
04:36:00.789 --> 04:36:00.799 align:start position:0%
which is basically a grant which
 
04:36:03.349 --> 04:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
supplements what we're providing for
 
04:36:05.510 --> 04:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
and allows districts that are poor
 
04:36:07.590 --> 04:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
districts to
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
try to uh
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
better their in achievement and in an
 
04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
improvement amongst the kids
 
04:36:14.879 --> 04:36:16.310 align:start position:0%
improvement amongst the kids
so

04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:19.029 --> 04:36:19.039 align:start position:0%
i i don't see any reason why we would be
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
objecting to this and even with that
 
04:36:23.670 --> 04:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
accountability built in which we need to
 
04:36:23.680 --> 04:36:24.789 align:start position:0%
accountability built in which we need to
have

04:36:24.789 --> 04:36:24.799 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:36:26.310 --> 04:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
because we we know there's a lot of
 
04:36:28.070 --> 04:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
reasons why children
 
04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
learn and they grow and it's not just
 
04:36:33.189 --> 04:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
dollars which do it in fact that's one
 
04:36:35.590 --> 04:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
of the primary reasons why i voted
 
04:36:38.230 --> 04:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
against the commission report
 
04:36:40.230 --> 04:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of other issues
 
04:36:42.629 --> 04:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
aspiration of the community education
 
04:36:44.629 --> 04:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
levels within the community
 
04:36:46.949 --> 04:36:46.959 align:start position:0%
leadership in the school is extremely
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
important the dedication of individual
 
04:36:51.109 --> 04:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
teachers you have some teachers which
 
04:36:53.510 --> 04:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
are superb not some a lot
 
04:36:55.349 --> 04:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
but you have some that punch in and
 
04:36:57.510 --> 04:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
punch out and that's that's it and
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of a whole lot of
 
04:37:01.349 --> 04:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
innovativeness i've seen it it's a
 
04:37:03.750 --> 04:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
minority but it's it's not the majority
 
04:37:06.150 --> 04:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
but you have it and those districts
 
04:37:09.510 --> 04:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
which are supervised properly and and
 
04:37:12.789 --> 04:37:12.799 align:start position:0%
have everybody playing on the same team
 
04:37:14.629 --> 04:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
and the doors just don't close and it's
 
04:37:16.551 --> 04:37:16.561 align:start position:0%
my bailiwick and i'll do what i want to
 
04:37:17.750 --> 04:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
do you work cooperatively and
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
collaboratively together you're going to
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
see growth so there's a lot of issues
 
04:37:25.029 --> 04:37:25.039 align:start position:0%
which come into play and growing yes you
 
04:37:27.590 --> 04:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
need the dollars this all contributes
 
04:37:30.230 --> 04:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
to great education
 
04:37:33.029 --> 04:37:33.039 align:start position:0%
all best practices
 
04:37:34.230 --> 04:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
may i
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um first of all i always
 
04:37:40.629 --> 04:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
always uh
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
kind of bristle when i hear the you know
 
04:37:44.789 --> 04:37:44.799 align:start position:0%
how much things have quadrupled in
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
cloths because
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
um i started teaching in 1969 70.
 
04:37:52.470 --> 04:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
my first salary and i was at the top of
 
04:37:54.869 --> 04:37:54.879 align:start position:0%
the of my entry level because i had a
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
master's degree at the time with seven
 
04:37:59.029 --> 04:37:59.039 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the year
 
04:37:59.039 --> 04:37:59.990 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the year
okay

04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:38:03.109 --> 04:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
um and i bought my first new car
 
04:38:04.629 --> 04:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
that year which was three thousand
 
04:38:04.639 --> 04:38:05.670 align:start position:0%
that year which was three thousand
dollars

04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:38:05.680 --> 04:38:06.709 align:start position:0%
dollars
so

04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:08.709 --> 04:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
to say that things haven't gone up it's
 
04:38:10.949 --> 04:38:10.959 align:start position:0%
gone up approximately
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
600 and
 
04:38:12.240 --> 04:38:13.349 align:start position:0%
600 and
some

04:38:13.349 --> 04:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:38:15.750 --> 04:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
percentage plus okay the just an
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
inflation just just regular cost of
 
04:38:19.830 --> 04:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
doing business
 
04:38:23.029 --> 04:38:23.039 align:start position:0%
but on top of that um yeah money does
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
does make a difference um chairman ladd
 
04:38:25.680 --> 04:38:26.709 align:start position:0%
does make a difference um chairman ladd
um

04:38:26.709 --> 04:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:28.629 --> 04:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
i think everybody in newport not
 
04:38:30.390 --> 04:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
everybody i can't speak for everybody
 
04:38:32.310 --> 04:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
but i would say the community wants
 
04:38:34.949 --> 04:38:34.959 align:start position:0%
their kids to succeed
 
04:38:37.990 --> 04:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
um they want them to be educated and
 
04:38:39.910 --> 04:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
they want to give them the best possible
 
04:38:39.920 --> 04:38:41.349 align:start position:0%
they want to give them the best possible
opportunity

04:38:41.349 --> 04:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:38:42.629 --> 04:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
the people in the eight towns of
 
04:38:45.029 --> 04:38:45.039 align:start position:0%
kearsarge want their kids to be
 
04:38:47.349 --> 04:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
educated and have high aspirations as
 
04:38:47.359 --> 04:38:48.551 align:start position:0%
educated and have high aspirations as
well

04:38:48.551 --> 04:38:48.561 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:38:50.390 --> 04:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
the difference is
 
04:38:51.830 --> 04:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
that a teacher
 
04:38:54.551 --> 04:38:54.561 align:start position:0%
over newport at the top of the
 
04:38:56.390 --> 04:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
teaching schedule
 
04:38:58.230 --> 04:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
if there was an opening at kearsarge for
 
04:39:01.269 --> 04:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
that or hanover for that or bow for that
 
04:39:02.949 --> 04:39:02.959 align:start position:0%
teacher to change
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
probably would get like a twenty ten to
 
04:39:06.551 --> 04:39:06.561 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollar
 
04:39:08.789 --> 04:39:08.799 align:start position:0%
pay increase just in the change
 
04:39:10.869 --> 04:39:10.879 align:start position:0%
if they were able to change
 
04:39:13.349 --> 04:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
so what happens is newport has a
 
04:39:15.349 --> 04:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
turnover of teachers every year
 
04:39:15.359 --> 04:39:16.629 align:start position:0%
turnover of teachers every year
unbelievable

04:39:16.629 --> 04:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
unbelievable
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
they've had an interim superintendent
 
04:39:20.470 --> 04:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
for i don't know the last four or five
 
04:39:20.480 --> 04:39:21.349 align:start position:0%
for i don't know the last four or five
years

04:39:21.349 --> 04:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%
interim because they couldn't find
 
04:39:25.429 --> 04:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
anybody to apply for that job at the
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
price that they had with the problems
 
04:39:29.349 --> 04:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
that they have in the community that
 
04:39:31.029 --> 04:39:31.039 align:start position:0%
they have to address
 
04:39:33.189 --> 04:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
um and he's quitting because he can't
 
04:39:35.189 --> 04:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
stand what's been happening the last
 
04:39:37.029 --> 04:39:37.039 align:start position:0%
year with the school board and
 
04:39:38.708 --> 04:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
the parents revolt and that sort of
 
04:39:38.718 --> 04:39:39.590 align:start position:0%
the parents revolt and that sort of
thing

04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:39:39.600 --> 04:39:40.868 align:start position:0%
thing
um

04:39:40.868 --> 04:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:43.270 --> 04:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
leadership um you know we went through
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
three or four superintendents while i
 
04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
was teaching
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
went through maybe three or four
 
04:39:48.480 --> 04:39:49.590 align:start position:0%
went through maybe three or four
principles

04:39:49.590 --> 04:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
principles
 
04:39:51.510 --> 04:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
newport has a new principal and a new
 
04:39:53.270 --> 04:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
superintendent about every three or four
 
04:39:53.280 --> 04:39:54.470 align:start position:0%
superintendent about every three or four
years

04:39:54.470 --> 04:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:39:56.708 --> 04:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
they have beginning teachers over there
 
04:39:59.350 --> 04:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
that stay for maybe one or two years
 
04:40:00.788 --> 04:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
they decide they want to stay in
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
teaching they get a job someplace else
 
04:40:06.868 --> 04:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
and continuity um
 
04:40:09.430 --> 04:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
the and it's based on money i mean
 
04:40:11.350 --> 04:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
that's why people are moving that's why
 
04:40:13.270 --> 04:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
people are changing there are some
 
04:40:15.270 --> 04:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
teachers at at newport that have stayed
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
there for 40 years
 
04:40:17.280 --> 04:40:18.070 align:start position:0%
there for 40 years
and

04:40:18.070 --> 04:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:19.510 --> 04:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
but there are few
 
04:40:20.948 --> 04:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
and they're very dedicated because
 
04:40:22.948 --> 04:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
they're part of that community
 
04:40:25.510 --> 04:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
but you know until we solve this problem
 
04:40:27.430 --> 04:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
of the inequality
 
04:40:27.440 --> 04:40:28.708 align:start position:0%
of the inequality
of

04:40:28.708 --> 04:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:40:30.788 --> 04:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
funding or financing however we want to
 
04:40:32.708 --> 04:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
put it i'm not as into it as as
 
04:40:35.350 --> 04:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative luna is but
 
04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
from a basic level until we solve that
 
04:40:37.920 --> 04:40:39.270 align:start position:0%
from a basic level until we solve that
problem

04:40:39.270 --> 04:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:40:40.948 --> 04:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
you know the state tests are not going
 
04:40:42.788 --> 04:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
to tell you the difference
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
and you're not going to get the
 
04:40:46.788 --> 04:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
achievement um scores
 
04:40:49.110 --> 04:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh because they're just not they're not
 
04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
it's just not going to happen
 
04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that's the root cause of of
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of things
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't think destroying public
 
04:41:02.628 --> 04:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:04.150 --> 04:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
um i
 
04:41:06.150 --> 04:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
i just commented i don't think anyone is
 
04:41:07.590 --> 04:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
talking about destroying the public
 
04:41:07.600 --> 04:41:08.708 align:start position:0%
talking about destroying the public
education

04:41:08.708 --> 04:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:41:09.830 --> 04:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
i see it
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
every day
 
04:41:15.190 --> 04:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
at the risk of
 
04:41:15.200 --> 04:41:16.868 align:start position:0%
at the risk of
being

04:41:16.868 --> 04:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:41:18.788 --> 04:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
yelled at again
 
04:41:21.510 --> 04:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
i want to say that
 
04:41:22.868 --> 04:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
me saying that we have brought up
 
04:41:24.948 --> 04:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
hillsborough as an example
 
04:41:27.510 --> 04:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
during my 15 20 years teaching in that
 
04:41:29.830 --> 04:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
district we were part of every school
 
04:41:32.310 --> 04:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
improvement program that was available
 
04:41:35.110 --> 04:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
to us through the whole time everything
 
04:41:36.628 --> 04:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
all the way back
 
04:41:36.638 --> 04:41:37.310 align:start position:0%
all the way back
to

04:41:37.310 --> 04:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:41:41.590 --> 04:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
1980s all the way up until 2002 the best
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
schools leadership program the regional
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
lab we were at target school we were
 
04:41:48.150 --> 04:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
involved in a
 
04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
an organization between
 
04:41:52.948 --> 04:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
new england college and antioch college
 
04:41:55.030 --> 04:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
and hillsborough to make things better
 
04:41:57.270 --> 04:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
improve the climate improve the attitude
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the children make them want to do
 
04:42:01.270 --> 04:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
more how can we do this better how can
 
04:42:03.190 --> 04:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
we teach them better how can we reach
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
the community better how can we get
 
04:42:08.150 --> 04:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
parents involved more how can we um make
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
make summer education available for kids
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
who need it how can we do all these
 
04:42:15.030 --> 04:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
things we did everything possible that
 
04:42:17.910 --> 04:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
our budget could afford
 
04:42:19.910 --> 04:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
and as representative
 
04:42:19.920 --> 04:42:21.750 align:start position:0%
and as representative
tanner

04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
tanner
 
04:42:24.310 --> 04:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
expressed we we used to joke because we
 
04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
would say we had the superintendent of
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
the week
 
04:42:29.910 --> 04:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
we had high teacher turnover low teacher
 
04:42:29.920 --> 04:42:30.788 align:start position:0%
we had high teacher turnover low teacher
pay

04:42:30.788 --> 04:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
pay
 
04:42:32.708 --> 04:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
so yes the money does
 
04:42:32.718 --> 04:42:34.310 align:start position:0%
so yes the money does
matter

04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
matter
 
04:42:36.788 --> 04:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
and the assumption that
 
04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
there are that people are not trying
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
hard to make things better in a poor
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
school district
 
04:42:44.160 --> 04:42:47.110 align:start position:0%
school district
is

04:42:47.110 --> 04:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:48.550 --> 04:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
insulting to me
 
04:42:51.510 --> 04:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
because i've lived it so please i know
 
04:42:52.948 --> 04:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for you maybe to
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
understand there are metrics we can use
 
04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
to determine if a school is doing well
 
04:43:00.070 --> 04:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
and look at the graduates what happens
 
04:43:03.750 --> 04:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
after they graduate where do they go
 
04:43:05.510 --> 04:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
my kids went to the hillsborough schools
 
04:43:07.750 --> 04:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
i told you about my kids
 
04:43:09.910 --> 04:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
they certainly aren't failing because we
 
04:43:13.590 --> 04:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
were poor we had low test scores
 
04:43:15.430 --> 04:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
and they're on all of their um
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
compatriots all of their peers are doing
 
04:43:19.430 --> 04:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
well so those are ways that we should
 
04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
look not necessarily
 
04:43:25.750 --> 04:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:27.270 --> 04:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:27.280 --> 04:43:30.948 align:start position:0%
thank you
representatives

04:43:30.948 --> 04:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:33.190 --> 04:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to clarify that i never
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
said anything about teachers not working
 
04:43:35.200 --> 04:43:36.070 align:start position:0%
said anything about teachers not working
hard

04:43:36.070 --> 04:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
hard
 
04:43:38.310 --> 04:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
so i don't i i don't appreciate that
 
04:43:40.230 --> 04:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
being brought up
 
04:43:42.708 --> 04:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
i was talking about plans
 
04:43:44.708 --> 04:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
for different ways of doing things which
 
04:43:46.628 --> 04:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
you've been working on
 
04:43:48.550 --> 04:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
which has nothing to do with how hard
 
04:43:51.590 --> 04:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
teachers are working and so no i have
 
04:43:53.270 --> 04:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
not said that i've not said anything
 
04:43:56.390 --> 04:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
against teachers i appreciate teachers
 
04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative thank you speaking with
 
04:43:58.080 --> 04:43:59.510 align:start position:0%
representative thank you speaking with
you

you
 
04:44:01.510 --> 04:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
see no further comments um
 
04:44:04.628 --> 04:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:06.070 --> 04:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
is ready um
 
04:44:09.190 --> 04:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a roll call vote on
 
04:44:15.990 --> 04:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:19.350 --> 04:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
mr chair could i ask a question
 
04:44:19.360 --> 04:44:20.390 align:start position:0%
mr chair could i ask a question
yes

04:44:20.390 --> 04:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:44:20.400 --> 04:44:21.910 align:start position:0%
yes
so

04:44:21.910 --> 04:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
when we looked at these um amendments
 
04:44:27.270 --> 04:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday there were three of them
 
04:44:28.868 --> 04:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
uh are are we
 
04:44:31.350 --> 04:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
is there a plan for considering the
 
04:44:34.470 --> 04:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
other two as well as this one or uh the
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
floor will be open to further amendment
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you
 
04:44:38.798 --> 04:44:49.590 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you
clerk

04:44:49.590 --> 04:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:50.948 --> 04:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
what's the best way that you don't get
 
04:44:50.958 --> 04:44:54.470 align:start position:0%
what's the best way that you don't get
confused

04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.510 --> 04:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
what she's concerned about see he's
 
04:45:14.230 --> 04:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
acting as because i'm making money
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:24.550 --> 04:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
that hint is what got me into trouble
 
04:45:24.560 --> 04:45:25.510 align:start position:0%
that hint is what got me into trouble
because

04:45:25.510 --> 04:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
if it's unanimous and i go down the row
 
04:45:30.070 --> 04:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
1 to 19 it's simple right but when we
 
04:45:31.750 --> 04:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
start jockeying back and forth and
 
04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
you're doing one and two
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's what's not
 
04:45:38.708 --> 04:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
i'm old and it worked okay
 
04:45:40.708 --> 04:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
and tell us to slow down if if we're
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
going too fast
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
yeah i was just going to say a clerk's
 
04:45:47.350 --> 04:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
hint is rather than using checks
 
04:45:50.310 --> 04:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
write a number down like one two that's
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
whatever works for the clerk works for
 
04:46:00.240 --> 04:46:02.550 align:start position:0%
whatever works for the clerk works for
us

04:46:02.550 --> 04:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:03.670 --> 04:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:46:03.680 --> 04:46:04.550 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:08.230 --> 04:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
so representative vlad yes
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield is yes
 
04:46:12.868 --> 04:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
representative boehm
 
04:46:12.878 --> 04:46:13.990 align:start position:0%

amendment 1384
 
04:47:13.040 --> 04:47:14.270 align:start position:0%
amendment 1384
to

04:47:14.270 --> 04:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:47:18.948 --> 04:47:18.958 align:start position:0%

motion

04:47:28.708 --> 04:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:31.830 --> 04:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
yes i would uh this this amendment is
 
04:47:34.470 --> 04:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
adding one more piece of the puzzle to
 
04:47:36.230 --> 04:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
this bill that we've been just working
 
04:47:36.240 --> 04:47:37.190 align:start position:0%
this bill that we've been just working
on

04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh we have the uh hennessey bill in the
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh accountability section
 
04:47:45.670 --> 04:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
and this adds in a section four which
 
04:47:46.868 --> 04:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
04:47:46.878 --> 04:47:47.670 align:start position:0%
deals with
the

04:47:47.670 --> 04:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
looking at our differentiated aid the
 
04:47:55.110 --> 04:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
component of special education
 
04:47:58.150 --> 04:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
and what this does it has it breaks
 
04:48:01.110 --> 04:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
special education aid down into two
 
04:48:03.430 --> 04:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
separate categories
 
04:48:06.070 --> 04:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
a category a which allocates two
 
04:48:07.670 --> 04:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
thousand thirty seven dollars eleven
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
cents to those special education iep
 
04:48:15.350 --> 04:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
areas which are part of that category a
 
04:48:18.788 --> 04:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
and then it also provides uh
 
04:48:22.550 --> 04:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
3 367 dollars and eight cents for the
 
04:48:22.560 --> 04:48:23.830 align:start position:0%
3 367 dollars and eight cents for the
category

04:48:23.830 --> 04:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
category
 
04:48:23.840 --> 04:48:24.628 align:start position:0%
category
b

04:48:24.628 --> 04:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
b
 
04:48:24.638 --> 04:48:25.590 align:start position:0%
b
which

04:48:25.590 --> 04:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:48:28.230 --> 04:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
includes uh the other 10 categories of
 
04:48:31.030 --> 04:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
ieps within it
 
04:48:33.430 --> 04:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
weighted formulas for
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
students that have handicapping
 
04:48:37.270 --> 04:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
condition are widely used throughout
 
04:48:39.190 --> 04:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
this country
 
04:48:41.750 --> 04:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
well over 30 states are now doing this
 
04:48:42.948 --> 04:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
well over
 
04:48:45.190 --> 04:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh we have had sort of like a hybrid
 
04:48:47.350 --> 04:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
model right now dealing with the
 
04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
category of cat aid and then we have
 
04:48:52.390 --> 04:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
this category for all students so it's
 
04:48:55.430 --> 04:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
not really a weighted formula but it is
 
04:48:57.190 --> 04:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
a hybrid
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
um what we're looking at now is giving
 
04:49:03.670 --> 04:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
specific weights a weight of 0.54 of the
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the uh amount of the base
 
04:49:07.200 --> 04:49:08.470 align:start position:0%
of the uh amount of the base
adequacy

04:49:08.470 --> 04:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
04:49:11.110 --> 04:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
to the students in the first two or
 
04:49:12.868 --> 04:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
three iep
 
04:49:13.990 --> 04:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
04:49:16.390 --> 04:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
identifying disabilities that come under
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
category a
 
04:49:21.430 --> 04:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
and then within category b the other ten
 
04:49:24.390 --> 04:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
are funded at a a different percentage
 
04:49:26.070 --> 04:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
that percentage is roughly around a
 
04:49:27.670 --> 04:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
point eight
 
04:49:30.150 --> 04:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
four or thereabouts i'd have to look
 
04:49:32.788 --> 04:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:36.868 --> 04:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
of the uh base adequacy amount
 
04:49:38.550 --> 04:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
let me turn to that page so i can give
 
04:49:47.670 --> 04:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:48.948 --> 04:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
okay the
 
04:49:51.350 --> 04:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
category b is a point eight nine three
 
04:49:52.470 --> 04:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
thousand three hundred sixty seven
 
04:49:54.550 --> 04:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
dollars and eight cents that's eighty
 
04:49:56.948 --> 04:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
nine percent of the base
 
04:49:59.990 --> 04:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
added on to the you know the base when
 
04:50:01.990 --> 04:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
they when they get their differentiated
 
04:50:05.270 --> 04:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
data and base adequacy we have within
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
our education funding formula
 
04:50:10.310 --> 04:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
several components which are
 
04:50:12.868 --> 04:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh constitutional mandated areas that's
 
04:50:16.150 --> 04:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
the cost of a and every every student
 
04:50:18.628 --> 04:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
gets the same amount of money in the
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
state regardless of their
 
04:50:23.510 --> 04:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
their community's wealth or poverty they
 
04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
get the base cost and then they also in
 
04:50:32.628 --> 04:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:35.110 --> 04:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
then you add in the areas that they get
 
04:50:37.910 --> 04:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
for a differentiated aid if they qualify
 
04:50:39.750 --> 04:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
and of course to qualify under special
 
04:50:41.830 --> 04:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
ed you have to have an iep
 
04:50:43.670 --> 04:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
and it's based upon one of those
 
04:50:43.680 --> 04:50:45.750 align:start position:0%
and it's based upon one of those
categories

04:50:45.750 --> 04:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
categories
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
weighted categories have been used for
 
04:50:50.390 --> 04:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
many many years in these other districts
 
04:50:52.390 --> 04:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i think it's only fair
 
04:50:54.390 --> 04:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
that we do that
 
04:50:57.030 --> 04:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
we know that it costs a great deal more
 
04:50:59.990 --> 04:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
money to have a student receiving
 
04:51:02.708 --> 04:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
orthopedic services or a child that has
 
04:51:04.628 --> 04:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury
 
04:51:06.788 --> 04:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
or multiple handicaps
 
04:51:11.110 --> 04:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
or has an area that is one of those high
 
04:51:13.590 --> 04:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
cost high need areas of special
 
04:51:13.600 --> 04:51:14.868 align:start position:0%
cost high need areas of special
education

04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:51:16.550 --> 04:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
now there are some kids in speech that
 
04:51:19.270 --> 04:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
only get a few minutes per week maybe 30
 
04:51:22.070 --> 04:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
minutes maybe more maybe less even
 
04:51:24.390 --> 04:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
but there are also some that get
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
more than that
 
04:51:28.150 --> 04:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
so yes it could be considered high needs
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
but when you boil it down to what is the
 
04:51:33.590 --> 04:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
average cost of those categories it per
 
04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
person it comes up much much more money
 
04:51:38.230 --> 04:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
is needed for those in the upper levels
 
04:51:40.470 --> 04:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
we have not been funding it at the
 
04:51:43.030 --> 04:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
levels we should be ever since i arrived
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
here in the house and i looked at the
 
04:51:47.910 --> 04:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
formula which came out of 2007 as a flat
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
per capita cost that we've been funding
 
04:51:51.750 --> 04:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
in differentiated aid
 
04:51:54.070 --> 04:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
all students who have an iep are treated
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
the same with the exception if you're a
 
04:51:57.990 --> 04:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
cat aid then but the district has to
 
04:52:00.150 --> 04:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
kick in a significant hunk of dollar
 
04:52:01.990 --> 04:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
there that's something we need to look
 
04:52:04.868 --> 04:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
at down the roadways here and i suggest
 
04:52:06.550 --> 04:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
we look at it quickly it wouldn't be
 
04:52:08.788 --> 04:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
this year but we we've tried to do that
 
04:52:10.550 --> 04:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
and other years have tried to drop that
 
04:52:12.310 --> 04:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
three and a half times to two and a half
 
04:52:15.510 --> 04:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
times that comes up to a lot of money
 
04:52:17.830 --> 04:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
and uh but it takes a lot of money to
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
educate students too and i concur and i
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
agree on that and this is one area where
 
04:52:26.868 --> 04:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
i feel it's necessary that this this com
 
04:52:29.510 --> 04:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
element within the adequacy formula be
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
changed and and we
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
change the policy so it's more
 
04:52:35.590 --> 04:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
reflective of needs i'm not saying we're
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
getting there all the way but just to
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
change this one area one area the
 
04:52:44.948 --> 04:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
category b from a 0.54 to a 0.89 we're
 
04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
increasing it somewhere between 14 and
 
04:52:49.350 --> 04:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars
 
04:52:52.550 --> 04:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
if you add on the total costs of the
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grant program and
 
04:52:56.550 --> 04:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
this you're going to come up a little
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
shallow up 30 30 million dollars would
 
04:53:01.830 --> 04:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
be added into our fy 23 and fi 24
 
04:53:04.830 --> 04:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
budgets or fy23 that's what i'll say
 
04:53:08.150 --> 04:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
fy23 this amount for this this component
 
04:53:11.590 --> 04:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
here will not change it's not a grant it
 
04:53:14.550 --> 04:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
won't it's part of the mandated portion
 
04:53:16.948 --> 04:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
of the constitution portion of our of
 
04:53:19.270 --> 04:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
our formula it will continue as long as
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
you have the students that qualify for
 
04:53:23.430 --> 04:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
the iep if the same students are there
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
you will continue to get that amount of
 
04:53:27.670 --> 04:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
money uh
 
04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
with the condition that you know it's
 
04:53:32.150 --> 04:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
changed every biennium by the cola
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh cost living so i guess that's quickly
 
04:53:37.350 --> 04:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
i don't want to go too much longer here
 
04:53:39.430 --> 04:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
on this we've discussed this previously
 
04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you i'll be glad to take any
 
04:53:43.190 --> 04:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
questions if it's necessary thank you uh
 
04:53:45.430 --> 04:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative baum as second yeah
 
04:53:47.350 --> 04:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
second yeah and just to
 
04:53:49.110 --> 04:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
clarify things i hope
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
this this amendment 84 keeps
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
81 and adds
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh on page two from 15 down
 
04:54:00.628 --> 04:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
so just so we should really be
 
04:54:03.270 --> 04:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
discussing from blind 15 down on page
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
two just to
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
clarify things thank you
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative luno um thank you very
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
much mr chair and thank you very much
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative ladd for bringing this in
 
04:54:16.390 --> 04:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if um if i've got a
 
04:54:19.110 --> 04:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
question for mark if he wouldn't mind
 
04:54:20.868 --> 04:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
taking it
 
04:54:25.670 --> 04:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:27.190 --> 04:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
the fy
 
04:54:27.200 --> 04:54:29.510 align:start position:0%
the fy

04:54:29.510 --> 04:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
23
 
04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy spreadsheet
 
04:54:33.270 --> 04:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
from the department
 
04:54:33.280 --> 04:54:34.070 align:start position:0%
from the department
and

04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:54:34.080 --> 04:54:35.350 align:start position:0%
and
currently

04:54:35.350 --> 04:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:54:38.190 --> 04:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
the department has um
 
04:54:40.230 --> 04:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
2037.11 cents and there is the
 
04:54:42.070 --> 04:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid factor for special
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
education is that correct rick yes and
 
04:54:44.958 --> 04:54:45.750 align:start position:0%
education is that correct rick yes and
and

04:54:45.750 --> 04:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:54:47.350 --> 04:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
and the amendment that you're bringing
 
04:54:47.360 --> 04:54:48.390 align:start position:0%
and the amendment that you're bringing
in

04:54:48.390 --> 04:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh brings in
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
depending upon the category of the
 
04:54:56.150 --> 04:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
student either an additional 2037
 
04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
or an additional thirty three hundred
 
04:55:01.270 --> 04:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
sixty seven dollars that's correct
 
04:55:03.910 --> 04:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
yes it the the students which are in
 
04:55:06.150 --> 04:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
category aid will continue to get that
 
04:55:08.310 --> 04:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
amount which is currently projected
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
estimated for two fy twenty three the
 
04:55:11.360 --> 04:55:13.670 align:start position:0%
estimated for two fy twenty three the
2037

04:55:13.670 --> 04:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
2037
 
04:55:13.680 --> 04:55:14.470 align:start position:0%
2037
okay

04:55:14.470 --> 04:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:55:17.990 --> 04:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
then the the students which qualify for
 
04:55:20.948 --> 04:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
one of those ten categories in iep
 
04:55:22.708 --> 04:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
identifying the iep
 
04:55:25.270 --> 04:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
whether it be autism or hearing impaired
 
04:55:26.470 --> 04:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
or some of the others have mentioned
 
04:55:30.390 --> 04:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay they would get the 3 367
 
04:55:33.830 --> 04:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh and eight cents uh per student
 
04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
um so you can see there there is a uh a
 
04:55:39.990 --> 04:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
difference there between a and b is
 
04:55:42.230 --> 04:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
pretty significant difference at that a
 
04:55:44.948 --> 04:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
and b and and there would still
 
04:55:48.310 --> 04:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
exist a category that that
 
04:55:50.948 --> 04:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
is um
 
04:55:54.470 --> 04:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
not a and b is that right
 
04:55:56.230 --> 04:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
or is a and b well if you're talking
 
04:55:58.550 --> 04:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
about the cat aid but that's not part of
 
04:55:59.990 --> 04:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
that no no i'm not talking about that
 
04:56:01.750 --> 04:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about so
 
04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
so for wait the weighted formula costs
 
04:56:07.270 --> 04:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
then for differentiated so you
 
04:56:09.910 --> 04:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
you said it's about 30 million
 
04:56:12.628 --> 04:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
according to this sheet here for both
 
04:56:14.788 --> 04:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
for i i said for both if you're adding
 
04:56:16.470 --> 04:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
in the needs
 
04:56:16.480 --> 04:56:17.190 align:start position:0%
in the needs
the

04:56:17.190 --> 04:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:56:19.350 --> 04:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs the fiscal capacity
 
04:56:22.390 --> 04:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
portion 420. therefore
 
04:56:24.788 --> 04:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
what was that 14
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
7 was it or
 
04:56:28.470 --> 04:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
approximately something i can't i'd have
 
04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:37.750 --> 04:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
it was 14.6
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
yeah so i rounded out the 14 7 and then
 
04:56:42.708 --> 04:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
if you added in the
 
04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
cost of this particular program right
 
04:56:44.878 --> 04:56:45.750 align:start position:0%
cost of this particular program right
here

04:56:45.750 --> 04:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:56:47.670 --> 04:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty close to the same
 
04:56:49.110 --> 04:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
04:56:51.750 --> 04:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
so you're coming up to a total increase
 
04:56:53.910 --> 04:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
in costs for you know that would have to
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
be fun another 30 approximately a little
 
04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
shallow or 30 million dollars so did did
 
04:57:01.350 --> 04:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
mark prepare this i i did that
 
04:57:01.360 --> 04:57:02.708 align:start position:0%
mark prepare this i i did that
um

04:57:02.708 --> 04:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:04.470 --> 04:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
mark do you have the ability to comment
 
04:57:06.390 --> 04:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:57:06.400 --> 04:57:07.430 align:start position:0%
on this
um

04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
comment as far as is from the technical
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
perspective yeah so so
 
04:57:13.910 --> 04:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
so i've got the i've got the the
 
04:57:16.948 --> 04:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
department's fy23 adequacy spreadsheet
 
04:57:17.910 --> 04:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
up here
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
and and if i just increase
 
04:57:21.600 --> 04:57:23.030 align:start position:0%
and and if i just increase
the

04:57:23.030 --> 04:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:57:23.040 --> 04:57:24.070 align:start position:0%
the
the

04:57:24.070 --> 04:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:57:26.150 --> 04:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
make sure the two thousand thirty seven
 
04:57:27.750 --> 04:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
dollars and eleven cents that's in there
 
04:57:30.310 --> 04:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
now for special education and i just
 
04:57:32.470 --> 04:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
bumped that up to 4 000
 
04:57:35.590 --> 04:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
which doesn't even
 
04:57:36.708 --> 04:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:57:38.868 --> 04:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't even come come close to
 
04:57:40.788 --> 04:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
categories a or b
 
04:57:43.270 --> 04:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
if i just bump that up to 4 000 it comes
 
04:57:47.110 --> 04:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
to 119 million dollars
 
04:57:49.350 --> 04:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
no i think you're not what am i you're
 
04:57:51.430 --> 04:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
missing you're missing there are you
 
04:57:54.868 --> 04:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
category a has 18 000 plus students in
 
04:57:56.310 --> 04:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
it yeah
 
04:58:00.948 --> 04:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
category b has 11 000 students in it
 
04:58:02.868 --> 04:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
so that total universe
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:58:05.830 --> 04:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
for that that's the total universe of
 
04:58:07.270 --> 04:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
special ed students i agree with that's
 
04:58:11.030 --> 04:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
right so roughly 30 000 kids so so adam
 
04:58:13.750 --> 04:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
at a minimum if everybody was just
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
category a
 
04:58:18.470 --> 04:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
if everybody was just category a they'd
 
04:58:21.110 --> 04:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
be getting the 2037
 
04:58:23.270 --> 04:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
from the current adequacy formula and
 
04:58:27.590 --> 04:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:30.310 --> 04:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
from the amendment if everybody was just
 
04:58:34.470 --> 04:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
category a so all i did was plug four
 
04:58:36.948 --> 04:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in to the adequacy
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet where it used to have 2037
 
04:58:39.600 --> 04:58:40.270 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet where it used to have 2037
so

04:58:40.270 --> 04:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:43.788 --> 04:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
2037 times two
 
04:58:43.798 --> 04:58:45.670 align:start position:0%
2037 times two
4060

04:58:45.670 --> 04:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
4060
 
04:58:45.680 --> 04:58:47.590 align:start position:0%
4060
and

04:58:47.590 --> 04:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:51.430 --> 04:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
and i get 119 million dollars not 30
 
04:58:51.440 --> 04:58:55.510 align:start position:0%
and i get 119 million dollars not 30
million

04:58:55.510 --> 04:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:58.150 --> 04:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
i i i don't get where you are i'm not
 
04:59:00.150 --> 04:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
sure what i'm missing here yeah
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
and so so that's why i'm i'm asking if
 
04:59:02.718 --> 04:59:04.470 align:start position:0%
and so so that's why i'm i'm asking if
mark

04:59:04.470 --> 04:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
mark
 
04:59:06.948 --> 04:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
if you take if you take 54
 
04:59:09.110 --> 04:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the base what do you come up with two
 
04:59:12.310 --> 04:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
thousand thirty seven dollars
 
04:59:12.320 --> 04:59:13.030 align:start position:0%
thousand thirty seven dollars
right

04:59:13.030 --> 04:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:59:15.030 --> 04:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
you take eighty nine percent of the base
 
04:59:16.390 --> 04:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
you come up with three thousand three
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
hundred sixty seven dollars and eight
 
04:59:18.000 --> 04:59:19.190 align:start position:0%
hundred sixty seven dollars and eight
cents

04:59:19.190 --> 04:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
cents
 
04:59:19.200 --> 04:59:20.230 align:start position:0%
cents
so

04:59:20.230 --> 04:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:21.750 --> 04:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're all going to get the base
 
04:59:23.990 --> 04:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy it's just part of that part of
 
04:59:26.230 --> 04:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
the side side of things but on the
 
04:59:29.430 --> 04:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
special ed side that component
 
04:59:31.510 --> 04:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to get either the 2000 or
 
04:59:33.270 --> 04:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
the 3.3
 
04:59:34.788 --> 04:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars depending upon which
 
04:59:36.390 --> 04:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
category you're in
 
04:59:39.350 --> 04:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
so am i correct in that the uh
 
04:59:41.590 --> 04:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh students with a disability under
 
04:59:43.350 --> 04:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
category a
 
04:59:47.030 --> 04:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
get the 2037 as they currently do under
 
04:59:49.190 --> 04:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
the 2023
 
04:59:52.470 --> 04:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
um calculation correct but then
 
04:59:54.310 --> 04:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
if those students
 
04:59:57.750 --> 04:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
qualify instead for category b
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
instead of that two thousand dollars
 
05:00:02.708 --> 05:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
they get the three thousand three sixty
 
05:00:04.708 --> 05:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
seven that's right and it comes up to a
 
05:00:07.830 --> 05:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
total of 75.5 million dollars
 
05:00:09.590 --> 05:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
and then if you look at what we're
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
spending now at 60.6 million dollars so
 
05:00:15.590 --> 05:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
the difference is roughly 14.8 million
 
05:00:17.510 --> 05:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
or wherever you want to go on that
 
05:00:19.270 --> 05:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
rounding off okay so it's not in a
 
05:00:21.670 --> 05:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
you're not increasing special education
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
overall you're only increasing it for
 
05:00:26.070 --> 05:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
the category b
 
05:00:28.150 --> 05:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
student that's correct because it's a
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
weighted formula i'm using the weight
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
that we use right now
 
05:00:33.430 --> 05:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
for those
 
05:00:35.750 --> 05:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
kids that might be in like a resource
 
05:00:37.350 --> 05:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
room who could have a learning
 
05:00:39.510 --> 05:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
disability okay for those which have the
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
significant hard to deal with
 
05:00:43.510 --> 05:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'd love to be able to fund them more
 
05:00:44.788 --> 05:00:44.798 align:start position:0%
believe me
 
05:00:46.868 --> 05:00:46.878 align:start position:0%
but you know i'm trying to be a realist
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
too at this time and dealing with our
 
05:00:48.718 --> 05:00:49.830 align:start position:0%
too at this time and dealing with our
budget

05:00:49.830 --> 05:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh and they're waited out at that
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
particular amount that i have there
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
so it's overall that 14.87
 
05:00:59.590 --> 05:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
what three
 
05:01:02.150 --> 05:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
going on increase just just to i think
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's i think we've figured it out but
 
05:01:05.350 --> 05:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
just to clap i've sort of eyeballed
 
05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
representative lad's numbers here and i
 
05:01:08.310 --> 05:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
haven't ran the spreadsheet myself but
 
05:01:10.070 --> 05:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
just eyeballing it the the numbers
 
05:01:12.310 --> 05:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
appear to work okay um so we'll if this
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
passes the house uh uh floor then we'll
 
05:01:16.550 --> 05:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note okay
 
05:01:18.150 --> 05:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
but but yeah i think the easier way to
 
05:01:19.430 --> 05:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
think about it is you're guaranteed that
 
05:01:22.948 --> 05:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
2037 as constitutionally uh uh uh
 
05:01:24.868 --> 05:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
required and then you get basically an
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
extra 1 330 dollars if you're in that uh
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
other category
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
right all right good thank you for your
 
05:01:33.030 --> 05:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
explanation mark
 
05:01:35.830 --> 05:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh any further questions for mark
 
05:01:37.750 --> 05:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
before we let him uh get back to a more
 
05:01:39.510 --> 05:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable seat
 
05:01:42.788 --> 05:01:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much um marjorie
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:49.440 --> 05:01:51.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:01:51.190 --> 05:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:01:53.110 --> 05:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
05:01:54.708 --> 05:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:01:56.628 --> 05:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure i understand this
 
05:01:59.430 --> 05:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
when we say an additional two thousand
 
05:02:01.990 --> 05:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
three thirty seven eleven
 
05:02:04.788 --> 05:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
for each pupil
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:12.310 --> 05:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
please let me just finish
 
05:02:15.670 --> 05:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
that language there
 
05:02:15.680 --> 05:02:16.550 align:start position:0%
that language there
is

05:02:16.550 --> 05:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:02:16.560 --> 05:02:17.910 align:start position:0%
is
current

05:02:17.910 --> 05:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
current
 
05:02:20.550 --> 05:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
in the current law it says that
 
05:02:21.990 --> 05:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
is that right that's
 
05:02:25.030 --> 05:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
correct okay and then when we say
 
05:02:28.230 --> 05:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
three thousand three hundred sixty seven
 
05:02:32.070 --> 05:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
dollars and eight cents
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
is that three thousand three hundred
 
05:02:36.708 --> 05:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
sixty seven dollars and eight cents over
 
05:02:40.070 --> 05:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
and above the two thousand no or is it
 
05:02:41.910 --> 05:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
instead of the two thousand that's
 
05:02:45.990 --> 05:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative like this
 
05:02:50.230 --> 05:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that this is
 
05:02:52.390 --> 05:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
something that will reduce
 
05:02:54.628 --> 05:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
property taxes because
 
05:02:56.628 --> 05:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
the amount that we have to spend for
 
05:02:58.708 --> 05:02:58.718 align:start position:0%
special ed is a fixed amount for each
 
05:02:58.718 --> 05:02:59.830 align:start position:0%
special ed is a fixed amount for each
student

05:02:59.830 --> 05:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
student
 
05:03:02.310 --> 05:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
and by the state paying more the
 
05:03:04.948 --> 05:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
community doesn't have to pay as much
 
05:03:08.788 --> 05:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
so that is the point of this
 
05:03:13.110 --> 05:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:13.120 --> 05:03:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:03:15.030 --> 05:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:03:17.590 --> 05:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
it might not make property taxes go down
 
05:03:19.590 --> 05:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
because it could enable school districts
 
05:03:21.590 --> 05:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
to provide the special ed that they
 
05:03:23.350 --> 05:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
should be providing so that we don't
 
05:03:25.430 --> 05:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
have the problem that was brought up
 
05:03:26.788 --> 05:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
05:03:30.070 --> 05:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:30.080 --> 05:03:32.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:03:32.550 --> 05:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:34.788 --> 05:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
represent representative hobson thank
 
05:03:37.430 --> 05:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
you for mr chair um i i just want to say
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
that i think this is something that's
 
05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
going to make
 
05:03:43.030 --> 05:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
my constituents very happy they've been
 
05:03:45.190 --> 05:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
looking for an increase
 
05:03:47.750 --> 05:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
from the state so i think this will
 
05:03:51.910 --> 05:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:54.230 --> 05:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
may i add one last yes representative
 
05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
just to give you some figures here so
 
05:03:57.350 --> 05:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
you're aware where we are with our
 
05:04:00.070 --> 05:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
population in terms of special education
 
05:04:02.310 --> 05:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
students in the state
 
05:04:04.070 --> 05:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
and why we need to do something like
 
05:04:05.270 --> 05:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
this to
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
increase the weights
 
05:04:11.230 --> 05:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
in 2008 we had 195
 
05:04:13.670 --> 05:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
383 students
 
05:04:15.910 --> 05:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
05:04:17.868 --> 05:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
of that population
 
05:04:20.510 --> 05:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
15.4 percent or 30
 
05:04:25.110 --> 05:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
156 kids had ieps
 
05:04:26.708 --> 05:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
now we have
 
05:04:26.718 --> 05:04:28.628 align:start position:0%
now we have
166

05:04:28.628 --> 05:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
166
 
05:04:31.030 --> 05:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
262 kids
 
05:04:33.230 --> 05:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
and of that population
 
05:04:35.270 --> 05:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
18.2 percent
 
05:04:38.070 --> 05:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
have ieps or 30
 
05:04:38.080 --> 05:04:40.390 align:start position:0%
have ieps or 30
309.

05:04:40.390 --> 05:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
309.
 
05:04:40.400 --> 05:04:41.190 align:start position:0%
309.
so

05:04:41.190 --> 05:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:43.510 --> 05:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
we have more ieps
 
05:04:48.070 --> 05:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
now than we had back in 2008 when we had
 
05:04:50.150 --> 05:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
at least 10 percent more population in
 
05:04:51.350 --> 05:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:04:53.830 --> 05:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a sign that
 
05:04:56.550 --> 05:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
um and i don't believe we're over
 
05:04:58.868 --> 05:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
identifying either
 
05:05:00.788 --> 05:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that be the case we have
 
05:05:02.470 --> 05:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
too many good professionals out there
 
05:05:04.550 --> 05:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
which are speech pathologists or
 
05:05:06.628 --> 05:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
physical therapists or
 
05:05:09.190 --> 05:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with audiology dealing with all
 
05:05:10.868 --> 05:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
these multiple handicaps we're talking
 
05:05:14.230 --> 05:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
about i believe we have children and
 
05:05:16.150 --> 05:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
after talking with my superintendent the
 
05:05:17.830 --> 05:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
other day they're having a number of
 
05:05:20.150 --> 05:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
kids coming in that are health impaired
 
05:05:22.550 --> 05:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
now which is a category
 
05:05:24.788 --> 05:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
and it's a significant category that
 
05:05:27.350 --> 05:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
everybody's trying to get a good fix on
 
05:05:29.110 --> 05:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
how do we help
 
05:05:31.990 --> 05:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it's erupted as a result
 
05:05:34.550 --> 05:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
the last couple years
 
05:05:36.628 --> 05:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
and and without that socialization
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
without the the issue of being in
 
05:05:40.868 --> 05:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
contact with the teacher there's a lot
 
05:05:42.708 --> 05:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
of emotional problems are wrapped up in
 
05:05:44.788 --> 05:05:44.798 align:start position:0%
that as well as well as physical health
 
05:05:44.798 --> 05:05:45.990 align:start position:0%
that as well as well as physical health
issues

05:05:45.990 --> 05:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:05:46.000 --> 05:05:46.788 align:start position:0%
issues
so

05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:05:49.830 --> 05:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
we have more ieps than we've had
 
05:05:49.840 --> 05:05:50.868 align:start position:0%
we have more ieps than we've had
ever

05:05:50.868 --> 05:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
ever
 
05:05:53.190 --> 05:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
and we've got to start addressing this
 
05:05:55.110 --> 05:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
heavy load which we have and we can't
 
05:05:56.788 --> 05:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
rely upon
 
05:05:58.948 --> 05:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
one of the issues which we have with our
 
05:06:00.550 --> 05:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
whole costing formula and i hope
 
05:06:02.310 --> 05:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative luno would also support
 
05:06:04.948 --> 05:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
me on this that we have a per capita
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
formula it's not a program-based formula
 
05:06:11.190 --> 05:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's based upon number of students in
 
05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
your district it's not based upon the
 
05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
programs that you have to deliver
 
05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
and we need to start inching away from
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
that and getting into the business of
 
05:06:22.150 --> 05:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
program budgeting
 
05:06:25.030 --> 05:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i think this is a small step just
 
05:06:27.270 --> 05:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
like we're landing on the moon a small
 
05:06:30.628 --> 05:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
step and hopefully we can make it work
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
05:06:34.628 --> 05:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
yes uh represent tanner thank you i'm
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
just wondering if we have
 
05:06:40.230 --> 05:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
the statistics of number one
 
05:06:42.310 --> 05:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
from the census how many children are
 
05:06:45.030 --> 05:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
actually in the state of new hampshire
 
05:06:46.150 --> 05:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:06:48.708 --> 05:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
how many children
 
05:06:51.270 --> 05:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
are out of that are in our public school
 
05:06:53.350 --> 05:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
system which is the amount that you've
 
05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
given us
 
05:06:56.788 --> 05:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
and then also take into account
 
05:06:59.990 --> 05:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh students between the time of 2008 and
 
05:07:01.270 --> 05:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
now that have
 
05:07:02.708 --> 05:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
gone to
 
05:07:02.718 --> 05:07:04.230 align:start position:0%
gone to
homeschooling

05:07:04.230 --> 05:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
homeschooling
 
05:07:06.708 --> 05:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
that probably are uh
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
leave maybe a more of a concentration of
 
05:07:11.670 --> 05:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
kids in public schools that do get
 
05:07:13.830 --> 05:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
services rather than people that pull
 
05:07:16.470 --> 05:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
their kids out and don't get services so
 
05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just you know sometimes the
 
05:07:21.030 --> 05:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
statistics aren't quite uh the same as
 
05:07:21.040 --> 05:07:21.830 align:start position:0%
statistics aren't quite uh the same as
what

05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:07:24.390 --> 05:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
face value is i i really wonder if i
 
05:07:24.400 --> 05:07:25.670 align:start position:0%
face value is i i really wonder if i
mean

05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
mean
 
05:07:26.948 --> 05:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
you know you gave us those two
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
statistics where the percentage has gone
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
up but i'm wondering if there aren't
 
05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
other factors that kind of uh go into
 
05:07:35.270 --> 05:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
that rather than just more kids are
 
05:07:38.070 --> 05:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
qualifying thanks
 
05:07:39.670 --> 05:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
05:07:41.190 --> 05:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh represent luna
 
05:07:43.590 --> 05:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair and um and you
 
05:07:44.628 --> 05:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
know thanks for the earlier
 
05:07:46.788 --> 05:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
clarification on the um the fiscal
 
05:07:48.788 --> 05:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
impact uh on this
 
05:07:50.948 --> 05:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
while you know i mentioned on monday
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
when uh when um representative ladd was
 
05:07:56.070 --> 05:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
was talking about these three amendments
 
05:07:57.750 --> 05:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
that that i felt it much more
 
05:08:00.150 --> 05:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate for um for limited state
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
resources to be applied where they're
 
05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
needed so
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
particularly the way sb 420 applies
 
05:08:10.948 --> 05:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
limited state for resources to resource
 
05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
limited and high
 
05:08:15.590 --> 05:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
high cost you know high poverty uh
 
05:08:17.948 --> 05:08:17.958 align:start position:0%
districts this uh you know
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
cross-the-board um increase to special
 
05:08:23.910 --> 05:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
education i don't think is the best way
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
to use um uh state funds but given the
 
05:08:28.390 --> 05:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
on this and and and given the uh the
 
05:08:30.958 --> 05:08:31.990 align:start position:0%
on this and and and given the uh the
increase

05:08:31.990 --> 05:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
increase
 
05:08:34.708 --> 05:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
in um in obviously special education
 
05:08:36.390 --> 05:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
costs and as a percentage special
 
05:08:39.430 --> 05:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
education students against the the total
 
05:08:42.550 --> 05:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
student population i'm i'm certainly
 
05:08:45.350 --> 05:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
going to be supporting this um this
 
05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
amendment i don't like the the
 
05:08:50.070 --> 05:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
part of the sandwich that's in the
 
05:08:52.070 --> 05:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
middle but we've already voted on that
 
05:08:54.628 --> 05:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
as part of it so so i'm really you know
 
05:08:57.830 --> 05:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
weighing in on on section four here and
 
05:09:01.510 --> 05:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh and i i think it's worth um uh worth
 
05:09:03.910 --> 05:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
strong committee support
 
05:09:05.910 --> 05:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative i think
 
05:09:07.670 --> 05:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
we're uh representative woodcock thank
 
05:09:09.190 --> 05:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
you just waiting for you no no you're
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
very quiet i've been very quiet i know
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:09:14.550 --> 05:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
thanks cliff
 
05:09:17.670 --> 05:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
um rick on the category a and b when the
 
05:09:20.070 --> 05:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
state breaks it down for the for the
 
05:09:22.550 --> 05:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to cities and towns
 
05:09:25.110 --> 05:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
do they currently now at all identify i
 
05:09:26.788 --> 05:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
mean i'm trying to think about the how
 
05:09:28.628 --> 05:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
they're going to do this
 
05:09:30.788 --> 05:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
the these categories are identified in
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
the cross sheet
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
but do they
 
05:09:35.190 --> 05:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
when they are sending down a figure
 
05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
that's based on
 
05:09:39.110 --> 05:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
all 13 categories
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
how are they going to be able to to uh
 
05:09:41.040 --> 05:09:42.470 align:start position:0%
how are they going to be able to to uh
um

05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:43.750 --> 05:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
determine this
 
05:09:46.390 --> 05:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
they they they have on you can go on the
 
05:09:48.150 --> 05:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
web and i i think i showed you one of
 
05:09:51.030 --> 05:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
the sheets so it lists the number of
 
05:09:51.040 --> 05:09:52.310 align:start position:0%
the sheets so it lists the number of
kids

05:09:52.310 --> 05:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
kids
 
05:09:54.868 --> 05:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
yeah i saw that i mean darling that is
 
05:09:56.470 --> 05:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's they have that's submitted by
 
05:09:58.070 --> 05:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
every district they do have this
 
05:10:01.190 --> 05:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
information there's been the issue
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh which i've been assured it can't be
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
resolved that you know if you have a
 
05:10:08.708 --> 05:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
district of 10 kids yeah and it might be
 
05:10:10.390 --> 05:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know you might run into that type
 
05:10:11.990 --> 05:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
and we've talked about that 10 or less
 
05:10:14.948 --> 05:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
kid districts uh that can be resolved
 
05:10:17.030 --> 05:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're having to do that right now
 
05:10:18.550 --> 05:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
if you have a district of 10 kids and
 
05:10:20.310 --> 05:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to get differentiated aid
 
05:10:22.230 --> 05:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
right of some kind it's going to be
 
05:10:24.230 --> 05:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
there right now too it just won't say
 
05:10:25.990 --> 05:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
which category you're in you just get
 
05:10:28.310 --> 05:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
this two thousand some odd dollars
 
05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
but i've been told that this can be done
 
05:10:33.590 --> 05:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay um another way of doing this and i
 
05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
i i'm not proposing it because i don't
 
05:10:37.990 --> 05:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
like it is to find the in-between
 
05:10:40.310 --> 05:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
percentage so that you continue to get
 
05:10:42.550 --> 05:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
this money to the districts but it's not
 
05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
based upon the policy it's not based
 
05:10:46.550 --> 05:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
upon the weighted factor for those
 
05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
categories that need this money
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
just one for auckland this would be
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
um this funding change
 
05:10:57.190 --> 05:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh if process through the whole mill
 
05:11:01.110 --> 05:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
would be the next biennium
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
the effective date of this is when it
 
05:11:04.550 --> 05:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
would be allocated
 
05:11:05.830 --> 05:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
to you know
 
05:11:07.590 --> 05:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
but remember you're it's always a catch
 
05:11:10.230 --> 05:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
up when you're behind right
 
05:11:11.830 --> 05:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you what the commission
 
05:11:13.990 --> 05:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
report was trying to address okay thank
 
05:11:18.070 --> 05:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
you uh chairman cordelia
 
05:11:19.430 --> 05:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative hopson did you have a
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
last comment oh sorry yeah i just was
 
05:11:24.150 --> 05:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
looking at um h uh sorry
 
05:11:26.948 --> 05:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
sb 420 and it says that it'll take

representative vlad do you have a
 
05:12:48.628 --> 05:12:48.638 align:start position:0%
further motion

is he bringing another one up
 
05:12:52.470 --> 05:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not bringing another member is the
 
05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
bill open to further amendment
 
05:13:00.150 --> 05:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:04.310 --> 05:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:11.910 --> 05:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:14.470 --> 05:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to ask jennifer four for
 
05:13:17.190 --> 05:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
a question here
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:22.080 --> 05:13:23.430 align:start position:0%
 
we've

05:13:23.430 --> 05:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
we've
 
05:13:26.230 --> 05:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
identified with two amendments
 
05:13:28.390 --> 05:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
the latter amendment had the first
 
05:13:32.230 --> 05:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
amendment incorporated into it
 
05:13:32.240 --> 05:13:34.070 align:start position:0%
amendment incorporated into it
so

05:13:34.070 --> 05:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:13:35.990 --> 05:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
if in fact nothing else is done and i'm
 
05:13:37.750 --> 05:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
not trying to say anything but i'm just
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get some process here
 
05:14:15.990 --> 05:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:18.070 --> 05:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
i think the way this amendment's drafted
 
05:14:19.590 --> 05:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
is it would be compatible because it
 
05:14:24.550 --> 05:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
replaces um only two parts in 198.40 f
 
05:14:27.030 --> 05:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
in the original bill and those same two
 
05:14:28.550 --> 05:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
parts that were in
 
05:14:32.830 --> 05:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
um both amendments that we just passed
 
05:14:32.840 --> 05:14:34.470 align:start position:0%
um both amendments that we just passed
right

05:14:34.470 --> 05:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:14:34.480 --> 05:14:35.350 align:start position:0%
right
yeah

05:14:35.350 --> 05:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:14:36.550 --> 05:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
but i think we're trying to figure that
 
05:14:38.470 --> 05:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
out i think this i think this amendment
 
05:14:41.190 --> 05:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
would be compatible though in a in a
 
05:14:43.190 --> 05:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
because it only replaces
 
05:14:44.788 --> 05:14:44.798 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
05:14:46.310 --> 05:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
most i don't have it in front of me but
 
05:14:53.590 --> 05:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:55.910 --> 05:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
based on jen's advice
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
maybe based on jen's advice
 
05:15:01.750 --> 05:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
um if there'd be a motion to reconsider
 
05:15:07.190 --> 05:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:10.708 --> 05:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
mr chairman in 1384. right
 
05:15:10.718 --> 05:15:17.430 align:start position:0%
mr chairman in 1384. right
boom

05:15:17.430 --> 05:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
and is there a second
 
05:15:23.030 --> 05:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
i don't need to do that okay
 
05:15:23.040 --> 05:15:24.868 align:start position:0%
i don't need to do that okay
board

05:15:24.868 --> 05:15:24.878 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:15:29.270 --> 05:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:31.110 --> 05:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
05:15:33.190 --> 05:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
yes on the floor
 
05:15:36.150 --> 05:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
if a bill is amended twice
 
05:15:38.310 --> 05:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
the second amendment
 
05:15:39.990 --> 05:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
is the one that
 
05:15:40.000 --> 05:15:45.110 align:start position:0%
is the one that
holds

05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:47.190 --> 05:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
oh i'm just wondering it doesn't work
 
05:15:49.830 --> 05:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
that way in committees
 
05:15:51.830 --> 05:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
but i i think what we've got here we
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
have one amendment that has exactly what
 
05:15:55.590 --> 05:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
the other one has in it and it's going
 
05:15:58.070 --> 05:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
to save some time over there with paul
 
05:15:58.080 --> 05:15:59.670 align:start position:0%
to save some time over there with paul
smith

05:15:59.670 --> 05:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
smith
 
05:16:01.910 --> 05:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
if we just you know get rid of the first
 
05:16:01.920 --> 05:16:03.350 align:start position:0%
if we just you know get rid of the first
one

05:16:03.350 --> 05:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:16:05.830 --> 05:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
and then move forward with that second
 
05:16:08.390 --> 05:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
one and take action which we have
 
05:16:19.830 --> 05:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:19.840 --> 05:16:26.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:16:26.788 --> 05:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:29.190 --> 05:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
okay so we have
 
05:16:31.830 --> 05:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
a motion in a second on reconsideration
 
05:16:34.628 --> 05:16:34.638 align:start position:0%
of amendment 1381
 
05:16:34.638 --> 05:16:35.670 align:start position:0%
of amendment 1381
um

05:16:35.670 --> 05:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:42.230 --> 05:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:45.590 --> 05:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
if we we could do it by just unanimously
 
05:16:48.550 --> 05:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
you don't have to go through that
 
05:16:51.590 --> 05:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
so we're just recalling 1381. we're just
 
05:16:55.350 --> 05:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:56.948 --> 05:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
well but we already voted for this one
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
which has all of this in it right
 
05:17:02.788 --> 05:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
so so 1384 encompasses 1381
 
05:17:05.110 --> 05:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
so we can get rid of 1381.
 
05:17:10.390 --> 05:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:15.990 --> 05:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:19.110 --> 05:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
so is there a further motion on
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh amendment 1381 i'll move itl on uh
 
05:17:23.520 --> 05:17:26.628 align:start position:0%
uh amendment 1381 i'll move itl on uh
1381.

05:17:26.628 --> 05:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:29.190 --> 05:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
second by uh representative hopson i'm
 
05:17:32.230 --> 05:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
gonna do a show at handsome yeah
 
05:17:34.070 --> 05:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
everybody ready
 
05:17:38.470 --> 05:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
the motion is itl on amendment 1381. all
 
05:17:43.110 --> 05:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:45.270 --> 05:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
i believe that also is unanimous madam
 
05:17:48.948 --> 05:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:53.030 --> 05:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:53.040 --> 05:17:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:17:53.910 --> 05:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:17:56.070 --> 05:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
our status is
 
05:17:57.830 --> 05:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
we currently have
 
05:17:57.840 --> 05:17:59.430 align:start position:0%
we currently have
uh

05:17:59.430 --> 05:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:18:02.550 --> 05:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
sb 420 amended by
 
05:18:02.560 --> 05:18:03.510 align:start position:0%
sb 420 amended by
uh

05:18:03.510 --> 05:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:18:05.830 --> 05:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
amendment 1384
 
05:18:08.390 --> 05:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
and we have a new amendment that's been
 
05:18:12.868 --> 05:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
handed out 1477. 1477.
 
05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh i think
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
luno and tanner yep and i'll speak
 
05:18:24.948 --> 05:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
quickly to it if i might
 
05:18:28.948 --> 05:18:28.958 align:start position:0%
yes so uh 1477 would um and i'm and i'm
 
05:18:31.350 --> 05:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
looking at i'm looking at 1477 which
 
05:18:33.750 --> 05:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
went around along with a a financial
 
05:18:33.760 --> 05:18:34.948 align:start position:0%
went around along with a a financial
analysis

05:18:34.948 --> 05:18:34.958 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
05:18:37.830 --> 05:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
on it um so i'm looking at 1477 and i'm
 
05:18:42.150 --> 05:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
looking at 1384 which um which is now um
 
05:18:43.830 --> 05:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
all of section one
 
05:18:45.670 --> 05:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
of the of the bill
 
05:18:48.390 --> 05:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
and um and so it would essentially
 
05:18:48.400 --> 05:18:49.590 align:start position:0%
and um and so it would essentially
replace

05:18:49.590 --> 05:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
replace
 
05:18:52.070 --> 05:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
in 1384
 
05:18:55.830 --> 05:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
everything from lines 14 through
 
05:18:55.840 --> 05:18:56.628 align:start position:0%
everything from lines 14 through
through

05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:18:56.638 --> 05:18:58.150 align:start position:0%
through
21

05:18:58.150 --> 05:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
21
 
05:19:01.590 --> 05:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
and um and so what it uh what it does
 
05:19:05.590 --> 05:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
is is essentially doubles the um
 
05:19:09.270 --> 05:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
the the extraordinary needs grant
 
05:19:13.270 --> 05:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
for um uh for districts that have uh
 
05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
less than um uh
 
05:19:18.070 --> 05:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
well less than six million dollars in
 
05:19:21.430 --> 05:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per eligible free
 
05:19:23.270 --> 05:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
and reduced price lunch
 
05:19:25.590 --> 05:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
pupil in the admr
 
05:19:27.270 --> 05:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
and um and
 
05:19:28.948 --> 05:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
05:19:32.708 --> 05:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
it does that by um by increasing the uh
 
05:19:36.470 --> 05:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
the the highest amount uh grant from
 
05:19:40.550 --> 05:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
650 dollars to 1250 dollars and then it
 
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
bleeds it down for every uh every dollar
 
05:19:48.150 --> 05:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
of uh equalized valuation per special ed
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
pupil uh between a million dollars and
 
05:19:54.390 --> 05:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
six million dollars by um
 
05:19:56.948 --> 05:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
you can see it on line eight point zero
 
05:19:59.670 --> 05:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
zero zero two five dollars
 
05:20:02.550 --> 05:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
and um show you how that calculation was
 
05:20:04.390 --> 05:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
made uh
 
05:20:07.590 --> 05:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty it's pretty simple um
 
05:20:10.708 --> 05:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
at uh at a million dollars you get 12.50
 
05:20:12.628 --> 05:20:12.638 align:start position:0%
per student at six million dollars you
 
05:20:13.910 --> 05:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
get zero
 
05:20:17.750 --> 05:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
and um and uh so 1250 divided by five
 
05:20:21.670 --> 05:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
million gets you to that number and um
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
and what what does that mean what would
 
05:20:27.430 --> 05:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
that mean for um uh for every district
 
05:20:28.390 --> 05:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:20:31.110 --> 05:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
and so the the financial and fiscal
 
05:20:33.830 --> 05:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
analysis that uh that came through i
 
05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
prepared it myself it was not uh
 
05:20:36.718 --> 05:20:38.470 align:start position:0%
prepared it myself it was not uh
um

05:20:38.470 --> 05:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:39.910 --> 05:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
the lba
 
05:20:43.030 --> 05:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
but but basically i took
 
05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
the valuations from the department of
 
05:20:46.948 --> 05:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
revenue administration's latest
 
05:20:50.548 --> 05:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
valuation sheet i used valuation of all
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
property less utilities and railroads
 
05:20:56.470 --> 05:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
which follows the language that
 
05:20:57.830 --> 05:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
that was in
 
05:20:59.270 --> 05:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey's
 
05:21:02.070 --> 05:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
original bill it uses the
 
05:21:04.470 --> 05:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced price lunch adm
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
from the department of ed's fy 23
 
05:21:06.958 --> 05:21:08.150 align:start position:0%
from the department of ed's fy 23
spreadsheet

05:21:08.150 --> 05:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
05:21:10.390 --> 05:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh gets a um an
 
05:21:13.030 --> 05:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh equalized valuation per pupil per
 
05:21:16.628 --> 05:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
frpl pupil and then uh calculates based
 
05:21:21.430 --> 05:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
on that the um the per pupil
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
grant the per frpl pupil grant that a
 
05:21:27.270 --> 05:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
district would receive and that extends
 
05:21:28.948 --> 05:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
that out in the final
 
05:21:30.868 --> 05:21:30.878 align:start position:0%
column and you can see that that final
 
05:21:33.750 --> 05:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
column totals to 28
 
05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
million six hundred forty three thousand
 
05:21:38.390 --> 05:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
dollars which is approximately double
 
05:21:41.830 --> 05:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
what uh what is in the um uh what was in
 
05:21:41.840 --> 05:21:42.628 align:start position:0%
what uh what is in the um uh what was in
uh

05:21:42.628 --> 05:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:45.910 --> 05:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 420 as it came over to us
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
and uh and of course now we've we've
 
05:21:51.110 --> 05:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
added another 14 million
 
05:21:53.350 --> 05:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
on top of that with the uh with the
 
05:21:56.470 --> 05:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
increase in um in category b
 
05:21:59.830 --> 05:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh special education um uh
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid so so
 
05:22:05.110 --> 05:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
what some what's what's important about
 
05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
um about this is that uh is that it
 
05:22:10.788 --> 05:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
applies to 28 million dollars so now
 
05:22:13.110 --> 05:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
you're looking at two things the the
 
05:22:14.868 --> 05:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
current bill is amended it's 28 million
 
05:22:17.190 --> 05:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
dollars the amendment here is 28 million
 
05:22:17.200 --> 05:22:18.230 align:start position:0%
dollars the amendment here is 28 million
dollars

05:22:18.230 --> 05:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:22:18.240 --> 05:22:19.350 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

05:22:19.350 --> 05:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:22.150 --> 05:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
and uh but it applies that uh it applies
 
05:22:26.070 --> 05:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
that 28 million dollars to um to
 
05:22:28.230 --> 05:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
property poor districts that have a lot
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
of poor families uh in it so it uh it it
 
05:22:33.910 --> 05:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
in fact um
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh deploys state resources where they're
 
05:22:40.070 --> 05:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
needed most and um and whether that
 
05:22:42.868 --> 05:22:42.878 align:start position:0%
means that uh that
 
05:22:44.628 --> 05:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
we we um
 
05:22:47.590 --> 05:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh we want to do this on top of the
 
05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
current amendment or uh or that this is
 
05:22:53.430 --> 05:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
preferable over and above the um uh or
 
05:22:55.510 --> 05:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
preferable over the um
 
05:22:59.030 --> 05:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
the um uh the expanded
 
05:23:01.030 --> 05:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid
 
05:23:02.788 --> 05:23:02.798 align:start position:0%
i don't know but
 
05:23:05.350 --> 05:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
given the conversation around here today
 
05:23:06.868 --> 05:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
it seems like there's been strong
 
05:23:09.350 --> 05:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
support to to get
 
05:23:11.910 --> 05:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
state money and everybody knows revenues
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
have come in real strong uh and get them
 
05:23:17.590 --> 05:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
out to uh reduce property taxes and uh
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
and and fund our schools and uh this
 
05:23:22.788 --> 05:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
certainly puts uh puts 28 million six
 
05:23:24.868 --> 05:23:24.878 align:start position:0%
hundred forty three thousand dollars
 
05:23:27.430 --> 05:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh where it's needed most so i hope we
 
05:23:29.030 --> 05:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
can have strong committee support on
 
05:23:30.628 --> 05:23:30.638 align:start position:0%
this one thank you
 
05:23:32.628 --> 05:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
uh representative tanner as the second
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
year um i just totally agree that we
 
05:23:37.670 --> 05:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
need targeted aid to to these areas and
 
05:23:39.430 --> 05:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's less than a parking garage so
 
05:23:39.440 --> 05:23:42.948 align:start position:0%
it's less than a parking garage so
thanks

05:23:42.948 --> 05:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:42.958 --> 05:23:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:23:43.830 --> 05:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:23:48.868 --> 05:23:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:51.990 --> 05:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
i i have a question about that yes i i
 
05:23:55.750 --> 05:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
heard just then targeted aid
 
05:24:00.150 --> 05:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:03.670 --> 05:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
targeted to use for a specific
 
05:24:03.680 --> 05:24:04.948 align:start position:0%
targeted to use for a specific
purpose

05:24:04.948 --> 05:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
05:24:07.510 --> 05:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
or does is it as we have the other
 
05:24:09.750 --> 05:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
portions of our adequate formula right
 
05:24:11.510 --> 05:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
now where it's stuffs
 
05:24:14.070 --> 05:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
money sent down to the district
 
05:24:16.470 --> 05:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
and the district uses as the district
 
05:24:18.310 --> 05:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
feels they should
 
05:24:21.750 --> 05:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
so can i i'll answer that yes rick thank
 
05:24:24.628 --> 05:24:24.638 align:start position:0%
you mr chair so no i would i you know i
 
05:24:28.310 --> 05:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
i would call this um as a good example
 
05:24:31.030 --> 05:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
of of maybe what 20 years ago people
 
05:24:33.190 --> 05:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
called targeted aid it was a very
 
05:24:35.190 --> 05:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
conservative approach to school funding
 
05:24:37.350 --> 05:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
i think it was opposed
 
05:24:39.350 --> 05:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
largely um
 
05:24:41.110 --> 05:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
by by
 
05:24:42.788 --> 05:24:42.798 align:start position:0%
members from the party that i belonged
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
to back 20 years ago and
 
05:24:46.080 --> 05:24:46.868 align:start position:0%
to back 20 years ago and
and

05:24:46.868 --> 05:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:49.350 --> 05:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
but i think it's it's abundantly clear
 
05:24:49.360 --> 05:24:50.390 align:start position:0%
but i think it's it's abundantly clear
that

05:24:50.390 --> 05:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:24:52.708 --> 05:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
that that new hampshire is going to
 
05:24:55.670 --> 05:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
continue to be a very revenue strapped
 
05:24:59.510 --> 05:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
um uh state that uh that should deplan
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
it and it's already by far i mean it's
 
05:25:05.910 --> 05:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
already the the applies the least amount
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
of state dollars per student of any
 
05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
other state in the country by far
 
05:25:14.868 --> 05:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
um and so um so you know i'm hoping that
 
05:25:17.110 --> 05:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire won't won't stay in that
 
05:25:18.788 --> 05:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
position forever
 
05:25:20.628 --> 05:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
this probably won't move the needle very
 
05:25:23.190 --> 05:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
much in bringing us out of that uh that
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
position but but it's abundantly clear
 
05:25:28.788 --> 05:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
at least to me that um that the state of
 
05:25:31.030 --> 05:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is not going to be
 
05:25:35.350 --> 05:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
um fully funding all of our our public
 
05:25:38.150 --> 05:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
school costs for every city in town at
 
05:25:41.350 --> 05:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
100 percent uh throughout the state so
 
05:25:43.430 --> 05:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
um so where can you where can those
 
05:25:46.628 --> 05:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
limited those precious state dollars uh
 
05:25:48.390 --> 05:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
have the most um
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
have the most impact well it's by
 
05:25:53.190 --> 05:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
targeting and that's what uh that's what
 
05:25:56.310 --> 05:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
um some proposals going back 20 years uh
 
05:26:00.150 --> 05:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
ago um looked to do and i said hey look
 
05:26:02.390 --> 05:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know manchester's least funded
 
05:26:03.910 --> 05:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
school in the state that students are
 
05:26:03.920 --> 05:26:05.030 align:start position:0%
school in the state that students are
performing

05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
performing
 
05:26:07.510 --> 05:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
um at the um you know
 
05:26:11.750 --> 05:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
not at a at a at a very high level on um
 
05:26:13.670 --> 05:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
on average
 
05:26:15.270 --> 05:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
what can we do for manchester what can
 
05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
we do for newport what can we do for
 
05:26:19.270 --> 05:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
berlin what can we do for pittsfield and
 
05:26:19.280 --> 05:26:20.230 align:start position:0%

structure that uh sen that senator
 
05:26:40.480 --> 05:26:42.708 align:start position:0%
structure that uh sen that senator
hennessey

05:26:42.708 --> 05:26:42.718 align:start position:0%
hennessey
 
05:26:43.910 --> 05:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:26:45.830 --> 05:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
and others
 
05:26:49.430 --> 05:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
sent over here in uh in senate bill 420
 
05:26:52.708 --> 05:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
and uh and that 14 million dollars is
 
05:26:54.050 --> 05:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
less than the
 
05:26:54.060 --> 05:26:55.190 align:start position:0%
less than the
[Music]

05:26:55.190 --> 05:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:26:57.270 --> 05:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
it's a million dollars less than the
 
05:27:00.390 --> 05:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
targeted aid that that we're sending to
 
05:27:04.548 --> 05:27:04.558 align:start position:0%
um um you know to alton and to wolfeboro
 
05:27:07.670 --> 05:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
and to newcastle and to newington and to
 
05:27:07.680 --> 05:27:08.830 align:start position:0%
and to newcastle and to newington and to
portsmouth

05:27:08.830 --> 05:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
portsmouth
 
05:27:11.190 --> 05:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
um that was done in the state budget in
 
05:27:12.948 --> 05:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
fact it's uh yeah it's a million dollars
 
05:27:14.708 --> 05:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
less than that and if anybody wants to
 
05:27:16.230 --> 05:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
see what the state budget did for those
 
05:27:18.070 --> 05:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
districts i've got um i've got the
 
05:27:20.390 --> 05:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
reports right here on that so i think if
 
05:27:22.948 --> 05:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
we're if we're seeing it free and clear
 
05:27:22.958 --> 05:27:23.990 align:start position:0%
we're if we're seeing it free and clear
to

05:27:23.990 --> 05:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:27:27.670 --> 05:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
to send 15 million dollars to
 
05:27:30.708 --> 05:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
to support the absolute wealthiest
 
05:27:33.030 --> 05:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
school districts um
 
05:27:35.430 --> 05:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
in the state and the state spending 10
 
05:27:38.230 --> 05:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars to bail out investors
 
05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
who tried to get around securities laws
 
05:27:43.430 --> 05:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and it's never been done anywhere
 
05:27:45.030 --> 05:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
in the country yeah they were scammed
 
05:27:47.190 --> 05:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
but they were taking their own risks
 
05:27:49.750 --> 05:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
and um and so 10 million dollars there
 
05:27:52.628 --> 05:27:52.638 align:start position:0%
then we can sure find 14 million dollars
 
05:27:54.628 --> 05:27:54.638 align:start position:0%
to uh to help
 
05:27:57.430 --> 05:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
our um our neediest districts by
 
05:27:59.830 --> 05:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
expanding that extraordinary need grant
 
05:28:02.310 --> 05:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
um and using the uh the state dollars
 
05:28:03.910 --> 05:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
the best way possible thank you
 
05:28:03.920 --> 05:28:04.830 align:start position:0%
the best way possible thank you
representative

05:28:04.830 --> 05:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:28:07.350 --> 05:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
moffatt thank you miss chair
 
05:28:10.150 --> 05:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
um i was taking notes listening intently
 
05:28:12.070 --> 05:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
and part of the rationale representative
 
05:28:14.548 --> 05:28:14.558 align:start position:0%
luno gave for moving ahead with this
 
05:28:17.270 --> 05:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
measure was to quote unquote reduce
 
05:28:19.510 --> 05:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
property taxes which
 
05:28:21.830 --> 05:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
again i'm sure is on the record that's
 
05:28:24.230 --> 05:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
being recorded so my ques my question i
 
05:28:26.548 --> 05:28:26.558 align:start position:0%
guess is for representative luno
 
05:28:29.110 --> 05:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh if part of the rationale for doing
 
05:28:32.070 --> 05:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
this is as you just said is to reduce
 
05:28:34.628 --> 05:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
property taxes how do you reconcile that
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
with the notion of targeted aid to help
 
05:28:36.958 --> 05:28:38.788 align:start position:0%
with the notion of targeted aid to help
schools

05:28:38.788 --> 05:28:38.798 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:28:39.990 --> 05:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much for the
 
05:28:42.788 --> 05:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
question i think it is both um and and
 
05:28:45.990 --> 05:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i didn't i hope i didn't just
 
05:28:49.030 --> 05:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
say that that that this would this stop
 
05:28:51.190 --> 05:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
this money would be used just to reduce
 
05:28:53.990 --> 05:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
um uh property taxes because there are
 
05:28:57.750 --> 05:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
some districts that um that have have
 
05:28:59.990 --> 05:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
have definitely stepped up to the plate
 
05:29:01.830 --> 05:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
probably well beyond what their fiscal
 
05:29:05.510 --> 05:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
capacity is to uh to be able to fund a
 
05:29:08.548 --> 05:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
um a strong education for their students
 
05:29:10.868 --> 05:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
and there's other districts that are
 
05:29:13.750 --> 05:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
trying so hard to uh to do that but
 
05:29:17.510 --> 05:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
still can't um can't come close so those
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
districts may actually need to put
 
05:29:22.070 --> 05:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a lot of them
 
05:29:24.708 --> 05:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
may need to put put this money towards
 
05:29:26.708 --> 05:29:26.718 align:start position:0%
program towards improving special
 
05:29:29.350 --> 05:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
education towards improving other um
 
05:29:31.590 --> 05:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
other programs that uh that student
 
05:29:34.708 --> 05:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
takes in improving student outcomes um
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
and um um and
 
05:29:40.150 --> 05:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
so i so i think it's i think it's it's a
 
05:29:42.070 --> 05:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
lot of both on that uh representative
 
05:29:44.708 --> 05:29:44.718 align:start position:0%
moffett and thank you for the question
 
05:29:46.628 --> 05:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative hopson
 
05:29:51.270 --> 05:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and if i could ask a
 
05:29:53.110 --> 05:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
question of rep luno
 
05:29:53.120 --> 05:29:53.990 align:start position:0%
question of rep luno
so

05:29:53.990 --> 05:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:29:56.070 --> 05:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
um we've just
 
05:29:58.868 --> 05:29:58.878 align:start position:0%
approved the bill as a as with the
 
05:30:01.990 --> 05:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
amendment for 30 million dollars
 
05:30:03.350 --> 05:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
and now this
 
05:30:05.430 --> 05:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh your amendment seeks to put in
 
05:30:05.440 --> 05:30:06.548 align:start position:0%
uh your amendment seeks to put in
another

05:30:06.548 --> 05:30:06.558 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:30:09.510 --> 05:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
14 or 20 million 14.
 
05:30:09.520 --> 05:30:10.708 align:start position:0%
14 or 20 million 14.
so

05:30:10.708 --> 05:30:10.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:13.350 --> 05:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
when i go back to my towns which don't
 
05:30:15.750 --> 05:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
qualify for any of this
 
05:30:18.230 --> 05:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's 50 million dollars
 
05:30:20.948 --> 05:30:20.958 align:start position:0%
the only benefit that i can tell them i
 
05:30:24.150 --> 05:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
worked to get for them is potentially
 
05:30:25.830 --> 05:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
a couple of thousand dollars for the
 
05:30:27.830 --> 05:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
special education students
 
05:30:30.230 --> 05:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with tripled electric
 
05:30:30.240 --> 05:30:31.110 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with tripled electric
bills

05:30:31.110 --> 05:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:30:34.150 --> 05:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
doubled gas bills
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're all feeling
 
05:30:36.000 --> 05:30:37.030 align:start position:0%
we're all feeling
this

05:30:37.030 --> 05:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:30:37.040 --> 05:30:38.470 align:start position:0%
this
i

05:30:38.470 --> 05:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:30:39.910 --> 05:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
i just want to know what what am i
 
05:30:42.070 --> 05:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to tell you yeah so so no i
 
05:30:44.868 --> 05:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
think that's a great a great question um
 
05:30:46.390 --> 05:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
you know i was really disappointed to
 
05:30:48.948 --> 05:30:48.958 align:start position:0%
hear that that there was one senator
 
05:30:52.070 --> 05:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
that uh that voted against um um senate
 
05:30:54.470 --> 05:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill 420 because it didn't do anything
 
05:30:58.310 --> 05:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
for um for their district and um and i'm
 
05:31:00.230 --> 05:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
profoundly disappointed by that because
 
05:31:02.470 --> 05:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
i think all of us have responsibilities
 
05:31:05.910 --> 05:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
that go beyond our um uh just
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
funding the schools in our own districts
 
05:31:11.270 --> 05:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
because the businesses in our districts
 
05:31:14.230 --> 05:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
the higher kids from manchester so it's
 
05:31:16.868 --> 05:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
important to me and hopkinton that that
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
kids in manchester get a strong
 
05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
education um honestly the bill that we
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
just the amendment that we just passed
 
05:31:26.390 --> 05:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
didn't do much for hopkinton and in fact
 
05:31:28.150 --> 05:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
the the amendment that i'm showing you
 
05:31:30.390 --> 05:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
right here does nothing for hopkinton
 
05:31:32.390 --> 05:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know what i got a couple of people
 
05:31:35.110 --> 05:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
in the trades over at my house today and
 
05:31:38.548 --> 05:31:38.558 align:start position:0%
um and um you know what they might
 
05:31:40.310 --> 05:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
actually if they were if they were
 
05:31:42.070 --> 05:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
members of this legislature they might
 
05:31:44.230 --> 05:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
be sitting on the other side of the room
 
05:31:45.990 --> 05:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
and and i said look i'm introducing
 
05:31:48.150 --> 05:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
amendments um and i've got a couple more
 
05:31:51.190 --> 05:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
to talk about that that honestly don't
 
05:31:53.590 --> 05:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
do that much for hopkinton but they do a
 
05:31:55.750 --> 05:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
lot of good across the state and they
 
05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
said that's good because that's what we
 
05:32:00.310 --> 05:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:03.430 --> 05:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
i i agree with you um i would like to
 
05:32:05.830 --> 05:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
see all of our students
 
05:32:08.708 --> 05:32:08.718 align:start position:0%
succeed i would like all of our towns to
 
05:32:08.718 --> 05:32:09.830 align:start position:0%
succeed i would like all of our towns to
succeed

05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
succeed
 
05:32:12.070 --> 05:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
as a state i feel pride
 
05:32:12.080 --> 05:32:15.350 align:start position:0%
as a state i feel pride
um

05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:18.548 --> 05:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
i just lost my thought i'm sorry sorry
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
well i mean
 
05:32:20.948 --> 05:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll
 
05:32:20.958 --> 05:32:22.548 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll
i'll

05:32:22.548 --> 05:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
05:32:25.350 --> 05:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
go at a go out of thought um
 
05:32:27.110 --> 05:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:32:28.708 --> 05:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
if that's the way you feel about this
 
05:32:30.150 --> 05:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'm really wondering how people feel
 
05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
about the 15.2 million that was um that
 
05:32:33.120 --> 05:32:33.910 align:start position:0%
about the 15.2 million that was um that
was

05:32:33.910 --> 05:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
sent as a extraordinary
 
05:32:39.510 --> 05:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
wealth grant to um to our wealthiest
 
05:32:41.910 --> 05:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
communities um as part of the budget you
 
05:32:44.390 --> 05:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
know so so i mean that's 15 million
 
05:32:46.470 --> 05:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
dollars going to specific
 
05:32:48.948 --> 05:32:48.958 align:start position:0%
communities didn't go to hopkinton uh
 
05:32:51.270 --> 05:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
might have gone to kingston i don't know
 
05:32:53.510 --> 05:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
um i'd have to look at the uh
 
05:32:56.390 --> 05:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
i could look at the report but um but
 
05:32:57.590 --> 05:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
05:33:00.310 --> 05:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
i i think i think people across the
 
05:33:02.948 --> 05:33:02.958 align:start position:0%
state recognize where there's need and
 
05:33:04.868 --> 05:33:04.878 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance of applying
 
05:33:06.948 --> 05:33:06.958 align:start position:0%
limited state resources where they're
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
needed not where they're not needed and
 
05:33:11.910 --> 05:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
and so that's what that's what this
 
05:33:15.190 --> 05:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
amendment um seeks to do
 
05:33:17.030 --> 05:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
i had a follow-up i remembered what i
 
05:33:20.310 --> 05:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to say uh it's about continuing
 
05:33:22.868 --> 05:33:22.878 align:start position:0%
this you know now we have
 
05:33:22.878 --> 05:33:23.750 align:start position:0%
this you know now we have
money

05:33:23.750 --> 05:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
in the trust fund it's it's when we
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
don't have money in the trust fund that
 
05:33:30.548 --> 05:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
i'm that i'm concerned about spending
 
05:33:32.868 --> 05:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
beyond our our needs so that's all i
 
05:33:34.070 --> 05:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to say but thank you for your
 
05:33:34.080 --> 05:33:40.390 align:start position:0%

um which um
 
05:47:44.788 --> 05:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
uh let's see
 
05:47:48.708 --> 05:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
would uh would would probably need to um
 
05:47:51.350 --> 05:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh have some massaging if it were to be
 
05:47:54.868 --> 05:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
adopted uh into a committee amendment
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
with uh with 1384
 
05:47:59.190 --> 05:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
but uh but let's take it one step at a
 
05:48:00.868 --> 05:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
time let me just talk to the amendment
 
05:48:02.948 --> 05:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
and not the technical work that would
 
05:48:05.510 --> 05:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
have to uh go in should it uh should it
 
05:48:08.948 --> 05:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
be recommended but um what um
 
05:48:12.628 --> 05:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
what uh what 1478 does is actually
 
05:48:14.788 --> 05:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
replace the um
 
05:48:14.798 --> 05:48:15.590 align:start position:0%
replace the um
the

05:48:15.590 --> 05:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:48:18.470 --> 05:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh what i would call the the resources
 
05:48:20.548 --> 05:48:20.558 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch
 
05:48:23.430 --> 05:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh extraordinary need grant
 
05:48:26.948 --> 05:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
uh as presented to us in um in senate
 
05:48:30.470 --> 05:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
bill 420 and replace it with a
 
05:48:33.430 --> 05:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
with a fiscal capacity disparity grant
 
05:48:35.990 --> 05:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
that that we've talked about uh in this
 
05:48:37.830 --> 05:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
committee before
 
05:48:41.110 --> 05:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
and um and was uh was part of
 
05:48:41.120 --> 05:48:42.390 align:start position:0%
and um and was uh was part of
the

05:48:42.390 --> 05:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:48:44.548 --> 05:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
the the fy
 
05:48:44.558 --> 05:48:45.470 align:start position:0%
the the fy
uh

05:48:45.470 --> 05:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:48:49.270 --> 05:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
2021 uh budget and part of uh house bill
 
05:48:52.310 --> 05:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
709 that that had passed this committee
 
05:48:55.670 --> 05:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 and uh was nearly
 
05:48:58.708 --> 05:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
unanimously you know passed on the um on
 
05:49:00.150 --> 05:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house
 
05:49:03.510 --> 05:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
and um and in fact it mirrors that um uh
 
05:49:05.590 --> 05:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
that that policy
 
05:49:09.990 --> 05:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
in in the in the fy 20 fy 21
 
05:49:13.110 --> 05:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
state budget um almost right down to the
 
05:49:15.270 --> 05:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
dollar so
 
05:49:21.830 --> 05:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
so uh again uh 1478 pulls out the um the
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
the the grant design that was in senate
 
05:49:27.750 --> 05:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
bill 420 is presented and replaces it
 
05:49:30.788 --> 05:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
and it replaces it with a with a policy
 
05:49:32.948 --> 05:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
that uh that is just based on a
 
05:49:36.150 --> 05:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
municipal municipal municipality's
 
05:49:39.670 --> 05:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per pupil not per
 
05:49:42.470 --> 05:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
pre-introduced price lunch pupil not per
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
special education pupil per pupil full
 
05:49:45.360 --> 05:49:46.390 align:start position:0%
special education pupil per pupil full
adm

05:49:46.390 --> 05:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
adm
 
05:49:48.628 --> 05:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
and so for a municipality that has an
 
05:49:51.350 --> 05:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per pupil
 
05:49:53.190 --> 05:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
of 500 000
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
or less uh they'll receive a an
 
05:50:00.150 --> 05:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
additional grant of 2 000 per pupil in
 
05:50:02.470 --> 05:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
the municipalities
 
05:50:05.590 --> 05:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
admr the municipalities enrollment
 
05:50:07.430 --> 05:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
that tapers off
 
05:50:07.440 --> 05:50:09.750 align:start position:0%
that tapers off
between

05:50:09.750 --> 05:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:50:11.430 --> 05:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
500 000
 
05:50:15.190 --> 05:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
and 1.1 million dollars and it tapers
 
05:50:17.350 --> 05:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
again it's it's pretty easy uh to
 
05:50:20.548 --> 05:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
calculate it's the two thousand dollars
 
05:50:22.948 --> 05:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
uh chipped away
 
05:50:25.990 --> 05:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
over over that um that one point six
 
05:50:27.750 --> 05:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
million dollar range from five hundred
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to 1.1 million dollars
 
05:50:34.150 --> 05:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
and uh and it does that at uh at
 
05:50:35.990 --> 05:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:50:38.788 --> 05:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
point zero zero three three
 
05:50:40.948 --> 05:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
uh dollars per
 
05:50:44.150 --> 05:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
0.333 dollars for every dollar
 
05:50:45.670 --> 05:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
difference in
 
05:50:48.470 --> 05:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh in the equalized valuation per pupil
 
05:50:51.670 --> 05:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
and um and that 1.1 million dollar
 
05:50:51.680 --> 05:50:54.150 align:start position:0%
and um and that 1.1 million dollar
point

05:50:54.150 --> 05:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:56.628 --> 05:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
i've also sent around a spreadsheet
 
05:50:59.910 --> 05:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
again i prepared this not mark not
 
05:51:02.868 --> 05:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
not the legislative budget assistant
 
05:51:03.910 --> 05:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:51:06.390 --> 05:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
and it shows that calculation it shows
 
05:51:09.750 --> 05:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
the the total uh grant that would be
 
05:51:12.548 --> 05:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
received by every municipality across
 
05:51:13.590 --> 05:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:51:16.070 --> 05:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
i apologize i did not clean up
 
05:51:18.310 --> 05:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
nor did i in the in the last one of the
 
05:51:21.030 --> 05:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
divide by zero errors for unincorporated
 
05:51:24.150 --> 05:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
places i just clearly um built them into
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
the um the list so that uh so that it
 
05:51:28.230 --> 05:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
was easy to
 
05:51:30.628 --> 05:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
to do the lookups with the with the
 
05:51:33.110 --> 05:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
department of revenue information so
 
05:51:33.120 --> 05:51:34.788 align:start position:0%
department of revenue information so
administration

05:51:34.788 --> 05:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
administration
 
05:51:37.830 --> 05:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
valuation data and it comes to uh just a
 
05:51:40.070 --> 05:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
little over 49 million dollars which i
 
05:51:42.470 --> 05:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
think is right practically
 
05:51:43.510 --> 05:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
at the
 
05:51:45.590 --> 05:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
at the at the spot we were at in house
 
05:51:48.390 --> 05:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
bill 709 and which ultimately became
 
05:51:49.750 --> 05:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
part of um
 
05:51:52.470 --> 05:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 the state budget in
 
05:51:56.230 --> 05:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
fy 20 and 21. so um
 
05:51:56.240 --> 05:51:57.030 align:start position:0%
fy 20 and 21. so um
so

05:51:57.030 --> 05:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh and it's and it's not because i
 
05:52:01.830 --> 05:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
didn't like the um
 
05:52:04.788 --> 05:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
the the policy that was uh that was sent
 
05:52:04.798 --> 05:52:05.590 align:start position:0%
the the policy that was uh that was sent
over

05:52:05.590 --> 05:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:52:09.590 --> 05:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
um uh i but i wanted to to show this
 
05:52:12.070 --> 05:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
committee what uh what a 50 million
 
05:52:15.350 --> 05:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
dollar um uh uh fiscal capacity
 
05:52:18.150 --> 05:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
disparity grant would uh would look like
 
05:52:20.948 --> 05:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
what it would mean to um uh to various
 
05:52:20.958 --> 05:52:22.390 align:start position:0%
what it would mean to um uh to various
communities

05:52:22.390 --> 05:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:52:25.270 --> 05:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
across the state and again i always urge
 
05:52:28.070 --> 05:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
people to use discipline and before
 
05:52:29.590 --> 05:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
going to um
 
05:52:32.548 --> 05:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
to your own community um you know take a
 
05:52:34.948 --> 05:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
look at uh you know take a look at
 
05:52:38.310 --> 05:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
manchester and um and what it would mean
 
05:52:39.910 --> 05:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh what it would mean to them take a
 
05:52:41.350 --> 05:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
look at milford
 
05:52:43.830 --> 05:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:52:43.840 --> 05:52:44.628 align:start position:0%
and um
and

05:52:44.628 --> 05:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:52:44.638 --> 05:52:46.230 align:start position:0%
and
and

05:52:46.230 --> 05:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:52:48.310 --> 05:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
so that's that's really the explanation
 
05:52:51.590 --> 05:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
of this and uh i'm i'm probably
 
05:52:53.510 --> 05:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
not going to um
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
to uh to offer a third amendment so uh
 
05:53:00.470 --> 05:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
so um but uh but i can tell you what the
 
05:53:03.670 --> 05:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
third amendment uh would do is combine
 
05:53:04.948 --> 05:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
back in
 
05:53:06.470 --> 05:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:53:09.190 --> 05:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary need grant based on
 
05:53:11.190 --> 05:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
resources and free and reduced price
 
05:53:13.990 --> 05:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
lunch in addition to fiscal capacity
 
05:53:17.750 --> 05:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
disparity and um uh and i believe uh
 
05:53:19.830 --> 05:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
honestly i believe that would be the the
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
best um use of um of state funds in uh
 
05:53:26.868 --> 05:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
in supporting school districts who
 
05:53:29.350 --> 05:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
support all of our students needs
 
05:53:31.430 --> 05:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
across the state so um
 
05:53:33.990 --> 05:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm happy to take some questions i
 
05:53:35.670 --> 05:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
hope you'd look at this favorably thank
 
05:53:35.680 --> 05:53:36.788 align:start position:0%
hope you'd look at this favorably thank
you

05:53:36.788 --> 05:53:36.798 align:start position:0%

05:53:38.470 --> 05:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tanner did you
 
05:53:39.830 --> 05:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
have anything to add
 
05:53:43.510 --> 05:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
yes i do uh first of all i'd like to
 
05:53:46.708 --> 05:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
say that i find uh representatives
 
05:53:49.030 --> 05:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
luno's extraordinary
 
05:53:51.670 --> 05:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh detailed
 
05:53:53.910 --> 05:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh spreadsheets and and
 
05:53:55.990 --> 05:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the fact that these
 
05:53:57.910 --> 05:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
amendments are meant
 
05:53:59.430 --> 05:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
to point out
 
05:53:59.440 --> 05:54:00.548 align:start position:0%
to point out
how

05:54:00.548 --> 05:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
how
 
05:54:03.990 --> 05:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
aid of financial aid from the state
 
05:54:07.110 --> 05:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
can and should go to the towns that they
 
05:54:08.390 --> 05:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
really need it
 
05:54:08.400 --> 05:54:09.670 align:start position:0%
really need it
and

05:54:09.670 --> 05:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:54:13.110 --> 05:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
what a difference it might make i mean
 
05:54:14.948 --> 05:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
to look down and see claremont which is
 
05:54:16.708 --> 05:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
not far from where i live although it's
 
05:54:19.270 --> 05:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
not one of my eight towns
 
05:54:21.430 --> 05:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
over three million dollars
 
05:54:22.628 --> 05:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:54:24.548 --> 05:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's
 
05:54:26.470 --> 05:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know we keep harping on
 
05:54:29.270 --> 05:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
until till education funding is solved
 
05:54:31.110 --> 05:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
05:54:33.510 --> 05:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
so that schools get adequate funding and
 
05:54:35.590 --> 05:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
we're not at the bottom of the barrel in
 
05:54:37.510 --> 05:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
state aid to education
 
05:54:37.520 --> 05:54:38.390 align:start position:0%
state aid to education
um

05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:41.190 --> 05:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
you know i think i think i appreciate
 
05:54:42.788 --> 05:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
these amendments and i appreciate the
 
05:54:45.030 --> 05:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
discussion that it sparks so i want to
 
05:54:48.868 --> 05:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:53.750 --> 05:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:56.708 --> 05:54:56.718 align:start position:0%
uh representative like lakers
 
05:54:58.948 --> 05:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
i guess it goes back to and i've had
 
05:55:01.030 --> 05:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
this problem with all of these
 
05:55:04.868 --> 05:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
it goes back to the um equalized
 
05:55:06.948 --> 05:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
valuation and
 
05:55:06.958 --> 05:55:08.150 align:start position:0%
valuation and
and

05:55:08.150 --> 05:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:55:10.628 --> 05:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
putting everything on that
 
05:55:14.310 --> 05:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
um when what our evaluation in a town is
 
05:55:16.868 --> 05:55:16.878 align:start position:0%
has a lot more to do with
 
05:55:16.878 --> 05:55:17.750 align:start position:0%
has a lot more to do with
the

05:55:17.750 --> 05:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:55:20.708 --> 05:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
desire the desirability versus the
 
05:55:23.510 --> 05:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
amount the number of
 
05:55:26.788 --> 05:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
homes available as opposed to how much
 
05:55:27.910 --> 05:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
somebody can
 
05:55:30.470 --> 05:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
a town can actually afford to pay
 
05:55:33.270 --> 05:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i point again to my 200 at this
 
05:55:35.830 --> 05:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
point almost 250 year old home that i
 
05:55:39.190 --> 05:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
bought for 82 000 that is today valued
 
05:55:39.200 --> 05:55:40.150 align:start position:0%
bought for 82 000 that is today valued
at

05:55:40.150 --> 05:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:55:41.990 --> 05:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
three hundred and eighty two thousand
 
05:55:42.000 --> 05:55:43.270 align:start position:0%
three hundred and eighty two thousand
dollars

05:55:43.270 --> 05:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:55:46.548 --> 05:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
and uh that didn't change my ability to
 
05:55:49.750 --> 05:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
pay my taxes and we do pay twice the
 
05:55:52.548 --> 05:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
taxes i mean for an average
 
05:55:55.030 --> 05:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
an average home in hudson pays twice the
 
05:55:58.150 --> 05:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
taxes of an average home in berlin
 
05:55:58.160 --> 05:56:00.070 align:start position:0%
taxes of an average home in berlin
and

05:56:00.070 --> 05:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:56:02.868 --> 05:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
you know it it it drives our taxes up it
 
05:56:04.628 --> 05:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
drives what we have to pay up but i
 
05:56:06.470 --> 05:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
don't see how it drives our ability to
 
05:56:08.628 --> 05:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
pay unless we sell that home
 
05:56:10.470 --> 05:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
and as long as you're still in your home
 
05:56:12.470 --> 05:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
you're not realizing any of that
 
05:56:15.190 --> 05:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
increased valuation yet it comes out and
 
05:56:17.830 --> 05:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
we're basing things on it and why are
 
05:56:21.270 --> 05:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
why is property in my town so
 
05:56:23.830 --> 05:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
expensive because there aren't enough
 
05:56:26.548 --> 05:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
homes across the border from mass for
 
05:56:29.030 --> 05:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
people to move to and so it's become a
 
05:56:31.110 --> 05:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
popular place there are more people
 
05:56:33.110 --> 05:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
wanting to move the move there it didn't
 
05:56:34.708 --> 05:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
change what the people in my town are
 
05:56:34.718 --> 05:56:39.830 align:start position:0%
change what the people in my town are
making

05:56:39.830 --> 05:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:42.390 --> 05:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
yes you may represent tanner
 
05:56:45.510 --> 05:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um property tax is a vision of
 
05:56:47.990 --> 05:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
the early early settlement of of the
 
05:56:50.150 --> 05:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
united states and how they chose to
 
05:56:52.868 --> 05:56:52.878 align:start position:0%
to say who had the ability to pay if had
 
05:56:52.878 --> 05:56:54.150 align:start position:0%
to say who had the ability to pay if had
property

05:56:54.150 --> 05:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:56:56.310 --> 05:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
you had the ability to pay over the
 
05:56:58.868 --> 05:56:58.878 align:start position:0%
years it's become a regressive tax it's
 
05:57:00.868 --> 05:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
considered a very regressive tax because
 
05:57:04.150 --> 05:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
it in fact you're right it doesn't give
 
05:57:06.708 --> 05:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
an accurate in indication of a person's
 
05:57:09.030 --> 05:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
ability to pay
 
05:57:10.310 --> 05:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 
05:57:12.548 --> 05:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
a more statewide tax
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
is is more considered more progressive
 
05:57:17.110 --> 05:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
however new hampshire has decided to
 
05:57:19.510 --> 05:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
stay with the regressive property tax
 
05:57:21.590 --> 05:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
and use it for almost everything and
 
05:57:23.510 --> 05:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
particularly education and that's why
 
05:57:25.270 --> 05:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's a that's why
 
05:57:26.788 --> 05:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
part of the reason we're having the
 
05:57:30.310 --> 05:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
problems we're having
 
05:57:30.320 --> 05:57:31.750 align:start position:0%
problems we're having
baum

05:57:31.750 --> 05:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
baum
 
05:57:33.350 --> 05:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and i
 
05:57:35.590 --> 05:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
represent on alicia's
 
05:57:40.310 --> 05:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:41.670 --> 05:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
in the south
 
05:57:43.670 --> 05:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state
 
05:57:45.270 --> 05:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
say a three hundred thousand dollar
 
05:57:48.230 --> 05:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
house that same house up in berlin or
 
05:57:50.788 --> 05:57:50.798 align:start position:0%
claremont it's probably a hundred fifty
 
05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar house
 
05:57:54.070 --> 05:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
so they're saying hey
 
05:57:55.270 --> 05:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
and so if their property tax is double
 
05:57:58.558 --> 05:57:59.670 align:start position:0%
and so if their property tax is double
mined

05:57:59.670 --> 05:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
mined
 
05:58:02.708 --> 05:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
they're paying the same amount of money
 
05:58:04.470 --> 05:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
so that's the problem with property
 
05:58:07.270 --> 05:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
taxes and in claremont in most of the
 
05:58:07.280 --> 05:58:08.150 align:start position:0%
taxes and in claremont in most of the
south

05:58:08.150 --> 05:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
south
 
05:58:10.390 --> 05:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
and in berlin too and most of the
 
05:58:13.030 --> 05:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state your school
 
05:58:16.070 --> 05:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
property taxes are probably 75 percent
 
05:58:18.788 --> 05:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
of your total taxes and your town and
 
05:58:21.670 --> 05:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
county is like 25 percent total in
 
05:58:24.948 --> 05:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
claremont it's 50 percent is municipal
 
05:58:28.150 --> 05:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
taxes and berlin is the same so it's not
 
05:58:31.110 --> 05:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
the school tax problem in berlin or
 
05:58:34.230 --> 05:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
clermont it's the municipal tax problem
 
05:58:37.350 --> 05:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
in claremont and berlin thank you
 
05:58:39.670 --> 05:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative lakers
 
05:58:41.190 --> 05:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why we leave it up to the
 
05:58:43.030 --> 05:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
towns to decide how much they're going
 
05:58:45.270 --> 05:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
to pay for their things because if you
 
05:58:47.350 --> 05:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
look how much does it cost for a teacher
 
05:58:48.470 --> 05:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
to live
 
05:58:50.470 --> 05:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
around our area how much does it cost
 
05:58:52.708 --> 05:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
for a teacher to live around berlin so
 
05:58:55.110 --> 05:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
yeah the cost of the education is going
 
05:58:57.510 --> 05:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
to be different in each case and so you
 
05:59:00.070 --> 05:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
can't i'm just saying this that's
 
05:59:00.080 --> 05:59:02.070 align:start position:0%
can't i'm just saying this that's
there's

05:59:02.070 --> 05:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:59:04.548 --> 05:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
basing how much or deciding whether what
 
05:59:06.548 --> 05:59:06.558 align:start position:0%
people have in etc
 
05:59:08.548 --> 05:59:08.558 align:start position:0%
based on this is
 
05:59:12.390 --> 05:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's an issue and
 
05:59:14.390 --> 05:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
but you can't compare
 
05:59:16.390 --> 05:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state anyways
 
05:59:17.910 --> 05:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
because what it caught what it cost to
 
05:59:22.390 --> 05:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:24.470 --> 05:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative luna thank you very much
 
05:59:27.190 --> 05:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
mr chair so um yeah i want to uh i want
 
05:59:29.510 --> 05:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
to unpack that one a little bit a little
 
05:59:30.470 --> 05:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
bit too
 
05:59:32.948 --> 05:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
uh i want to start though um
 
05:59:34.548 --> 05:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
because i think what what representative
 
05:59:36.788 --> 05:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
leakes just mentioned something that
 
05:59:38.390 --> 05:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative ladd mentioned earlier
 
05:59:41.430 --> 05:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
today which is the aspirations of a
 
05:59:44.548 --> 05:59:44.558 align:start position:0%
of a of a town for their schools and
 
05:59:46.310 --> 05:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't have very strong
 
05:59:48.310 --> 05:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
aspiration for their schools maybe they
 
05:59:50.948 --> 05:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
think everybody should should receive a
 
05:59:54.230 --> 05:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
very minimal education like was
 
05:59:56.868 --> 05:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
proposed to us earlier
 
06:00:00.548 --> 06:00:00.558 align:start position:0%
this year in house bill was it 1371
 
06:00:02.470 --> 06:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
06:00:02.480 --> 06:00:03.270 align:start position:0%
something like that
and

06:00:03.270 --> 06:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:00:05.190 --> 06:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh or maybe they want to provide hardly
 
06:00:07.270 --> 06:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
any education that's up to the town
 
06:00:09.190 --> 06:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
leave it up to them no
 
06:00:10.948 --> 06:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
can't just leave it up to them our state
 
06:00:13.270 --> 06:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
constitution says otherwise our state
 
06:00:14.948 --> 06:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
constitution says the state is
 
06:00:16.948 --> 06:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
responsible to make sure that every
 
06:00:19.350 --> 06:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
student in the state has an opportunity
 
06:00:22.628 --> 06:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education and the state
 
06:00:25.990 --> 06:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
needs to come in and do its job to make
 
06:00:29.190 --> 06:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
sure that every municipality has access
 
06:00:31.750 --> 06:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
to the resources they need to provide an
 
06:00:33.830 --> 06:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
adequate education an opportunity for an
 
06:00:36.310 --> 06:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
adequate education for their students
 
06:00:37.910 --> 06:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
we've also talked today about how
 
06:00:39.830 --> 06:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
important an opportunity for an adequate
 
06:00:41.750 --> 06:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
education or i should say an adequate
 
06:00:41.760 --> 06:00:43.110 align:start position:0%
education or i should say an adequate
education

06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
education
 
06:00:44.708 --> 06:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
can be looked at through student
 
06:00:48.390 --> 06:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
outcomes and um and why should throwing
 
06:00:50.310 --> 06:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
125 000
 
06:00:52.948 --> 06:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
to hillsborough expect that hillsborough
 
06:00:55.190 --> 06:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
is going to somehow magically
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh go from 15th percentile to 50th
 
06:01:00.150 --> 06:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
percentile do we really think
 
06:01:02.548 --> 06:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
hillsborough's aspiration is for their
 
06:01:04.150 --> 06:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
students to be achieving at the 15th
 
06:01:06.390 --> 06:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
percentile i bet not i bet people in
 
06:01:09.350 --> 06:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
hillsborough are working damn hard to uh
 
06:01:12.868 --> 06:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
to to to find the money to put and fund
 
06:01:15.030 --> 06:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
their schools and they're doing they're
 
06:01:17.190 --> 06:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
doing the hardest they can but they need
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit more support from the state
 
06:01:22.310 --> 06:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
so what would um what would this do for
 
06:01:24.708 --> 06:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
hillsborough i haven't even looked um
 
06:01:26.230 --> 06:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:01:26.240 --> 06:01:27.030 align:start position:0%
and um
and

06:01:27.030 --> 06:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:01:30.070 --> 06:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
for hillsboro would go would bring in
 
06:01:32.230 --> 06:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh put eight hundred fifty two thousand
 
06:01:35.030 --> 06:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
dollars uh to hillsborough um
 
06:01:36.230 --> 06:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot more than the hundred
 
06:01:38.628 --> 06:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars that um that that
 
06:01:41.030 --> 06:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
hillsboro seeing in the um uh in the
 
06:01:43.750 --> 06:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
other bill i mean in the um in the in
 
06:01:46.868 --> 06:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
the original bill but um uh
 
06:01:48.708 --> 06:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
is enough to move the needle
 
06:01:49.910 --> 06:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know what
 
06:01:51.430 --> 06:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
you start giving a district a million
 
06:01:54.310 --> 06:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
dollars on on top of a you know
 
06:01:56.150 --> 06:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
underfunded district yeah that's
 
06:01:57.990 --> 06:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
starting to move the needle it's moving
 
06:01:59.510 --> 06:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
the needle for claremont it would move
 
06:02:01.110 --> 06:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
the needle for berlin it would move the
 
06:02:03.110 --> 06:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
needle for for pittsfield and for
 
06:02:05.510 --> 06:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
hillsborough um and a lot of districts
 
06:02:08.390 --> 06:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
across the state so no it's not just
 
06:02:11.430 --> 06:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
left up to the to the town to decide
 
06:02:13.350 --> 06:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to do we have a
 
06:02:15.590 --> 06:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility around this table we have
 
06:02:17.510 --> 06:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
a responsibility in the legislature and
 
06:02:19.910 --> 06:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's got a responsibility to
 
06:02:22.628 --> 06:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that um that that every
 
06:02:24.788 --> 06:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
student has opportunity for an adequate
 
06:02:26.230 --> 06:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
education it's the state's
 
06:02:28.470 --> 06:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make sure that
 
06:02:30.708 --> 06:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
districts have the access to the
 
06:02:33.030 --> 06:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
resources they need to make sure that
 
06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
happens i agree with you alicia that
 
06:02:39.110 --> 06:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
that that the costs in every district uh
 
06:02:41.030 --> 06:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
can be different you use the word costs
 
06:02:43.830 --> 06:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
i was really careful in listening uh to
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
that but um
 
06:02:47.910 --> 06:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
but but i think what you may have meant
 
06:02:51.350 --> 06:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
to say was that was that the funding in
 
06:02:53.270 --> 06:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
every in every do all right the costs in
 
06:02:55.350 --> 06:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
every district meaning districts that
 
06:02:57.350 --> 06:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
have more free and reduced price lunch
 
06:02:58.548 --> 06:02:58.558 align:start position:0%
students it's going to cost a little
 
06:03:00.390 --> 06:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
more districts that have more special
 
06:03:02.390 --> 06:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
education students it's going to cost a
 
06:03:03.910 --> 06:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
06:03:05.590 --> 06:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
districts that have a high
 
06:03:07.510 --> 06:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
english language learning population
 
06:03:09.510 --> 06:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost a little bit more and
 
06:03:11.990 --> 06:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
that can be calculated out for every
 
06:03:14.150 --> 06:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
district in the state to provide an
 
06:03:16.390 --> 06:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
06:03:18.390 --> 06:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
and you'll clearly see that it costs
 
06:03:20.708 --> 06:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
more to educate a thousand students in
 
06:03:22.868 --> 06:03:22.878 align:start position:0%
manchester than a thousand students in
 
06:03:25.830 --> 06:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
bedford uh based on that but bedford's
 
06:03:28.868 --> 06:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
access to resources is much greater than
 
06:03:31.910 --> 06:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
manchester's access to resources
 
06:03:34.470 --> 06:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
and that's all these bills that's all
 
06:03:36.070 --> 06:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
these amendments
 
06:03:38.548 --> 06:03:38.558 align:start position:0%
try to uh try to bear out they look at
 
06:03:41.110 --> 06:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
it different ways and i and i i really
 
06:03:43.990 --> 06:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
do applaud senator hennessy
 
06:03:44.000 --> 06:03:45.030 align:start position:0%
do applaud senator hennessy
for

06:03:45.030 --> 06:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:03:46.230 --> 06:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
06:03:49.830 --> 06:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
sandwich together in a in a in a in a
 
06:03:52.948 --> 06:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
framework that only looks at funding and
 
06:03:56.628 --> 06:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
not not looks at costing uh a solution
 
06:03:59.910 --> 06:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
that tries to factor in both of uh both
 
06:04:01.270 --> 06:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
of those things
 
06:04:05.270 --> 06:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
and um and and um and so you know i i
 
06:04:08.628 --> 06:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
just i'm i'm grateful that that this
 
06:04:10.150 --> 06:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
committee today
 
06:04:14.150 --> 06:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
can can at least put forward um senate
 
06:04:17.590 --> 06:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
bill 420 and that um and that framework
 
06:04:19.990 --> 06:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm you know i think
 
06:04:21.430 --> 06:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of talking i don't
 
06:04:23.270 --> 06:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
think the accountability thing is well
 
06:04:24.628 --> 06:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
placed at all
 
06:04:27.510 --> 06:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
and um uh and i and i do think uh
 
06:04:30.470 --> 06:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
special education certainly deserves uh
 
06:04:32.708 --> 06:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
increased funding but the best use of
 
06:04:34.390 --> 06:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
state dollars are where they're needed
 
06:04:36.310 --> 06:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
most and that's what these amendments
 
06:04:40.230 --> 06:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:45.750 --> 06:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:47.670 --> 06:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
i've been sitting here quietly all day
 
06:04:50.470 --> 06:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
but uh i figure before we finish i'll
 
06:04:53.030 --> 06:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
get my two cents in um i live in
 
06:04:53.040 --> 06:04:54.230 align:start position:0%
get my two cents in um i live in
grantham

06:04:54.230 --> 06:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
grantham
 
06:04:56.788 --> 06:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
and grantham is uh
 
06:04:58.708 --> 06:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
got a really great school
 
06:05:01.270 --> 06:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
and funds the school very well i go to
 
06:05:03.190 --> 06:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
the school district meeting every year
 
06:05:04.150 --> 06:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
and we
 
06:05:05.830 --> 06:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
vote to pass a budget that's very
 
06:05:09.270 --> 06:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
generous for the school we do a good job
 
06:05:11.350 --> 06:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
i live one town north
 
06:05:13.510 --> 06:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
of croydon
 
06:05:14.868 --> 06:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
according has been in the news i won't
 
06:05:16.310 --> 06:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
even get into that
 
06:05:18.868 --> 06:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
i live two towns north of newport
 
06:05:20.868 --> 06:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
newport struggles as representative
 
06:05:24.470 --> 06:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
tanner was pointing out earlier they are
 
06:05:26.230 --> 06:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
a school that bleeds teachers every year
 
06:05:28.788 --> 06:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
because they don't they can't afford to
 
06:05:30.150 --> 06:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
pay them
 
06:05:33.670 --> 06:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
and um and we have chosen a uh
 
06:05:36.708 --> 06:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
property tax to support our schools
 
06:05:39.110 --> 06:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work very well but it's what
 
06:05:40.628 --> 06:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
we've got right now
 
06:05:42.548 --> 06:05:42.558 align:start position:0%
what this amendment will do
 
06:05:45.350 --> 06:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
will try to help out oh and by the way
 
06:05:47.830 --> 06:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
it does nothing for grantham um
 
06:05:49.670 --> 06:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
and my friends in grantham are okay with
 
06:05:49.680 --> 06:05:51.190 align:start position:0%
and my friends in grantham are okay with
that

06:05:51.190 --> 06:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:05:53.830 --> 06:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
they get the fact that we are a lucky
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
town we've got a lot of um valuable
 
06:05:56.000 --> 06:05:57.110 align:start position:0%
town we've got a lot of um valuable
property

06:05:57.110 --> 06:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
property
 
06:05:59.430 --> 06:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
much more property value than newport's
 
06:05:59.440 --> 06:06:00.788 align:start position:0%
much more property value than newport's
got

06:06:00.788 --> 06:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
got
 
06:06:00.798 --> 06:06:01.750 align:start position:0%
got
and

06:06:01.750 --> 06:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:06:04.070 --> 06:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
my friends in grantham are willing to
 
06:06:04.080 --> 06:06:04.788 align:start position:0%
my friends in grantham are willing to
see

06:06:04.788 --> 06:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
see
 
06:06:07.990 --> 06:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
newport and get money that we don't get
 
06:06:11.430 --> 06:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
because we can see very easily that we'd
 
06:06:13.910 --> 06:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
rather be sending our kids to school in
 
06:06:13.920 --> 06:06:14.948 align:start position:0%
rather be sending our kids to school in
grantham

06:06:14.948 --> 06:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
grantham
 
06:06:16.628 --> 06:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
than in newport
 
06:06:18.948 --> 06:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
um so i'm gonna support this uh this
 
06:06:21.430 --> 06:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
amendment because it it does good things
 
06:06:24.150 --> 06:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
for towns like newport even though it
 
06:06:26.628 --> 06:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
does nothing for towns like grantham
 
06:06:28.548 --> 06:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:06:29.590 --> 06:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:06:32.948 --> 06:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
for the representative vlad
 
06:06:34.868 --> 06:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
you know i've been listening to this
 
06:06:38.708 --> 06:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
conversation here and um
 
06:06:39.990 --> 06:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
represent luna you and i have been
 
06:06:42.070 --> 06:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
through this many many times this is you
 
06:06:43.510 --> 06:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
know all the factors and the elements
 
06:06:46.868 --> 06:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
that go into a formula like this
 
06:06:48.948 --> 06:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
and we're this formula that you're
 
06:06:50.708 --> 06:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
presenting today
 
06:06:50.718 --> 06:06:51.590 align:start position:0%
presenting today
is

06:06:51.590 --> 06:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:06:53.590 --> 06:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
really premised around equalized
 
06:06:55.750 --> 06:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil
 
06:06:58.150 --> 06:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
on property valuation
 
06:06:59.270 --> 06:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
now when i look at some of the
 
06:07:01.590 --> 06:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
communities in this state
 
06:07:04.150 --> 06:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
where folks are really struggling
 
06:07:05.350 --> 06:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
they're in communities where that
 
06:07:07.590 --> 06:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per pupil is up at 8
 
06:07:09.990 --> 06:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
million bucks
 
06:07:11.750 --> 06:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking about lincoln and
 
06:07:11.760 --> 06:07:13.190 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking about lincoln and
woodstock

06:07:13.190 --> 06:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
woodstock
 
06:07:15.910 --> 06:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
06:07:19.670 --> 06:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
and there the people that are working in
 
06:07:22.470 --> 06:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
those ski areas are
 
06:07:25.430 --> 06:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
earning that minimal wage or those
 
06:07:28.788 --> 06:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
restaurants or those retail shops
 
06:07:28.798 --> 06:07:30.548 align:start position:0%
restaurants or those retail shops
and

06:07:30.548 --> 06:07:30.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:07:33.270 --> 06:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
there is when i look at the achievement
 
06:07:35.430 --> 06:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
scores of kids over there they're
 
06:07:38.310 --> 06:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
they're not that great
 
06:07:41.270 --> 06:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
and the growth it's not that great
 
06:07:42.708 --> 06:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:07:44.708 --> 06:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
when we looked at this formula back in
 
06:07:48.390 --> 06:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
2008 and 2009
 
06:07:51.270 --> 06:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
we did not base totally on property
 
06:07:54.628 --> 06:07:54.638 align:start position:0%
valuation it was also contingent upon
 
06:07:57.910 --> 06:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:57.920 --> 06:07:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:07:59.030 --> 06:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:00.868 --> 06:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
when we have a formula that's premised
 
06:08:03.990 --> 06:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
around the singular element
 
06:08:06.948 --> 06:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
there are going to be some inequal
 
06:08:06.958 --> 06:08:08.150 align:start position:0%
there are going to be some inequal
unequal

06:08:08.150 --> 06:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
unequal
 
06:08:10.628 --> 06:08:10.638 align:start position:0%
inequities involved in here
 
06:08:10.638 --> 06:08:11.510 align:start position:0%
inequities involved in here
and

06:08:11.510 --> 06:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:13.910 --> 06:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
although i like portions of this and i
 
06:08:15.350 --> 06:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
understand my community would really
 
06:08:15.360 --> 06:08:16.868 align:start position:0%
understand my community would really
benefit

06:08:16.868 --> 06:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
06:08:19.910 --> 06:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's i don't know if we're there
 
06:08:19.920 --> 06:08:20.788 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's i don't know if we're there
yet

06:08:20.788 --> 06:08:20.798 align:start position:0%
yet
 
06:08:24.150 --> 06:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
um in the formula that i see that for
 
06:08:24.160 --> 06:08:25.590 align:start position:0%
um in the formula that i see that for
example

06:08:25.590 --> 06:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
example
 
06:08:27.670 --> 06:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh aaron hennessey put forward senator
 
06:08:29.590 --> 06:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
hennessey i looked at the town small
 
06:08:31.590 --> 06:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
town of monroe
 
06:08:34.390 --> 06:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
monroe is a small k through 6 district
 
06:08:36.230 --> 06:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
tuitions their kids to st johnsbury
 
06:08:38.788 --> 06:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
academy it all also has on the
 
06:08:40.548 --> 06:08:40.558 align:start position:0%
connecticut river where there's a huge
 
06:08:42.788 --> 06:08:42.798 align:start position:0%
huge dam that generates a lot of power
 
06:08:45.430 --> 06:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
and a lot of bucks
 
06:08:48.868 --> 06:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
under her plan they do receive money and
 
06:08:52.628 --> 06:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
on this other one they receive zero
 
06:08:52.638 --> 06:08:53.910 align:start position:0%
on this other one they receive zero
um

06:08:53.910 --> 06:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:56.948 --> 06:08:56.958 align:start position:0%
so i i'm trying to work work this out in
 
06:09:00.150 --> 06:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
my mind what way do we go on this and
 
06:09:01.990 --> 06:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:09:03.830 --> 06:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
although i see portions of this which
 
06:09:05.750 --> 06:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
are wonderful for certain communities
 
06:09:07.110 --> 06:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
there's other communities which have
 
06:09:08.628 --> 06:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
these unusual
 
06:09:10.230 --> 06:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
characteristics that we're not
 
06:09:10.240 --> 06:09:11.350 align:start position:0%
characteristics that we're not
addressing

06:09:11.350 --> 06:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
06:09:14.070 --> 06:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
how do we how do we help lincoln
 
06:09:16.310 --> 06:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
how do we help woodstock where the
 
06:09:20.470 --> 06:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:23.190 --> 06:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
i'll just say carroll county
 
06:09:25.030 --> 06:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
the meat as of a few years ago the
 
06:09:28.070 --> 06:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
medium family income for the county was
 
06:09:30.310 --> 06:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
the second lowest county
 
06:09:31.750 --> 06:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
06:09:34.470 --> 06:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars but we have
 
06:09:37.990 --> 06:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
four or five so-called donor towns in in
 
06:09:40.230 --> 06:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
the county as well
 
06:09:42.150 --> 06:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative luna thank you very much
 
06:09:45.830 --> 06:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair um just uh just to be um
 
06:09:48.390 --> 06:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
specific just looking at
 
06:09:50.548 --> 06:09:50.558 align:start position:0%
lincoln woodstock cooperative school
 
06:09:52.628 --> 06:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
district student outcomes their average
 
06:09:52.638 --> 06:09:53.750 align:start position:0%
district student outcomes their average
student

06:09:53.750 --> 06:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
student
 
06:09:56.230 --> 06:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
performs at somewhere around the 75th
 
06:09:57.830 --> 06:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
percentile so that's that's
 
06:09:59.590 --> 06:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
significantly above
 
06:10:01.670 --> 06:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
state average
 
06:10:03.430 --> 06:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
lincoln woodstock also
 
06:10:05.030 --> 06:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
lincoln has
 
06:10:06.868 --> 06:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
has some of the highest property
 
06:10:08.868 --> 06:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
valuations some of the lowest price the
 
06:10:12.230 --> 06:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
lowest one of the lower um uh property
 
06:10:15.110 --> 06:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
tax rates in the state so do uh do a lot
 
06:10:18.310 --> 06:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
of towns um uh in uh in carroll county
 
06:10:20.708 --> 06:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
too particularly the ones along uh along
 
06:10:24.548 --> 06:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
the lakes and um um and you know for the
 
06:10:28.070 --> 06:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
people that uh for for folks who uh who
 
06:10:31.590 --> 06:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
who live on a um uh live right on lake
 
06:10:35.350 --> 06:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee in a four five six million
 
06:10:35.360 --> 06:10:36.470 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee in a four five six million
dollar

06:10:36.470 --> 06:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
06:10:39.670 --> 06:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
home uh they're probably feeling lucky
 
06:10:41.270 --> 06:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
that they're not having to pay the
 
06:10:43.190 --> 06:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
property tax rate that people are paying
 
06:10:45.590 --> 06:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
in hillsborough or newport or hopkinton
 
06:10:47.670 --> 06:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
or claremont or berlin
 
06:10:49.750 --> 06:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
because it would probably not make that
 
06:10:52.230 --> 06:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
home a a four five six million dollar
 
06:10:52.240 --> 06:10:52.948 align:start position:0%
home a a four five six million dollar
home

06:10:52.948 --> 06:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
home
 
06:10:57.110 --> 06:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
um anymore um uh the the property tax
 
06:10:59.590 --> 06:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
rates and it's not just that that that
 
06:11:01.910 --> 06:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
the property tax rate one community is
 
06:11:04.230 --> 06:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
twice that of another community in some
 
06:11:06.548 --> 06:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
cases we're seeing almost a factor of 10
 
06:11:09.510 --> 06:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh difference between say let's say
 
06:11:13.910 --> 06:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
newcastle and um and um and claremont
 
06:11:16.230 --> 06:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
and and so you know putting that in
 
06:11:19.510 --> 06:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
perspective uh somebody that that buys a
 
06:11:19.520 --> 06:11:20.310 align:start position:0%
perspective uh somebody that that buys a
um

06:11:20.310 --> 06:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:21.590 --> 06:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
a um
 
06:11:22.948 --> 06:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
i don't even know if you can find a
 
06:11:25.350 --> 06:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
three million dollar home in um in
 
06:11:27.430 --> 06:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
newcastle but let's say a six million
 
06:11:30.470 --> 06:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
dollar home in newcastle could be paying
 
06:11:33.430 --> 06:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
um um you know
 
06:11:36.310 --> 06:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
almost the same property taxes as uh as
 
06:11:39.270 --> 06:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
somebody who lives in a um
 
06:11:41.670 --> 06:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
you know an average house in claremont
 
06:11:43.990 --> 06:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
same dollars in property taxes but a six
 
06:11:46.628 --> 06:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
million dollar home and um and you know
 
06:11:47.990 --> 06:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
they could have moved up from new york
 
06:11:50.150 --> 06:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
city they could be a money manager in
 
06:11:52.948 --> 06:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
manhattan come up on weekends um pretty
 
06:11:54.868 --> 06:11:54.878 align:start position:0%
sure that the person who bought that six
 
06:11:57.270 --> 06:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
million dollar home again it's access to
 
06:11:57.280 --> 06:11:58.628 align:start position:0%
million dollar home again it's access to
resources

06:11:58.628 --> 06:11:58.638 align:start position:0%
resources
 
06:12:01.590 --> 06:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
has access to resources beyond what the
 
06:12:04.708 --> 06:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
average homeowner in uh in claremont um
 
06:12:07.670 --> 06:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
has so so just to say that somebody
 
06:12:10.390 --> 06:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
should go from one community paying
 
06:12:12.788 --> 06:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
paying you know uh a fraction of a
 
06:12:15.590 --> 06:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
percent of their home value in property
 
06:12:17.910 --> 06:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
taxes and then in another community
 
06:12:19.510 --> 06:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
claremont i think it's nearly five
 
06:12:21.590 --> 06:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
percent isn't it fifty dollars per
 
06:12:22.948 --> 06:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
thousand yes
 
06:12:25.830 --> 06:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
like close to that so five percent of
 
06:12:28.628 --> 06:12:28.638 align:start position:0%
their home value in property taxes and
 
06:12:30.788 --> 06:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
that's what the equalized valuation per
 
06:12:33.670 --> 06:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
pupil formula straight formula goes to
 
06:12:36.948 --> 06:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh goes to at least providing some state
 
06:12:39.910 --> 06:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
support um for um uh for those
 
06:12:42.470 --> 06:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
communities and it does so in a measured
 
06:12:44.948 --> 06:12:44.958 align:start position:0%
way where it uh provides the greatest
 
06:12:47.110 --> 06:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
support to the communities with the with
 
06:12:49.590 --> 06:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
the least valuation and then tapers that
 
06:12:51.910 --> 06:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
off as you approach to the average
 
06:12:53.270 --> 06:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
um in
 
06:12:57.510 --> 06:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh in new hampshire so um
 
06:13:01.030 --> 06:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:02.868 --> 06:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
a representative like
 
06:13:05.030 --> 06:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just making sure i understand so
 
06:13:07.510 --> 06:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying five percent is high and
 
06:13:09.270 --> 06:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
out of line and they shouldn't have to
 
06:13:11.910 --> 06:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
pay that i pay that
 
06:13:13.910 --> 06:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
and we have a good school
 
06:13:15.430 --> 06:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
and we pay
 
06:13:17.430 --> 06:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
lower than the average
 
06:13:17.440 --> 06:13:18.948 align:start position:0%
lower than the average
um

06:13:18.948 --> 06:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:22.150 --> 06:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
state expenditure per pupil in hudson
 
06:13:30.310 --> 06:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:30.320 --> 06:13:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
right

06:13:34.070 --> 06:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:34.080 --> 06:13:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
over

06:13:35.030 --> 06:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
over
 
06:13:39.510 --> 06:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:41.110 --> 06:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
what's 80 i didn't say
 
06:13:41.120 --> 06:13:41.910 align:start position:0%
what's 80 i didn't say
no

06:13:41.910 --> 06:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:13:43.750 --> 06:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
so so um
 
06:13:45.030 --> 06:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
so 5
 
06:13:47.350 --> 06:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
is 50 per thousand
 
06:13:49.430 --> 06:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
tax rate
 
06:13:49.440 --> 06:13:54.548 align:start position:0%
tax rate
right

06:13:54.548 --> 06:13:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:54.558 --> 06:13:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:13:57.030 --> 06:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:58.470 --> 06:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'm waiting to find out where you're
 
06:13:58.480 --> 06:13:59.350 align:start position:0%
i'm waiting to find out where you're
going

06:13:59.350 --> 06:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
going
 
06:14:02.230 --> 06:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
what's that i'm not arguing with you oh
 
06:14:03.750 --> 06:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
i thought i thought you were no i was
 
06:14:08.070 --> 06:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:11.110 --> 06:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
no my comment was if 5
 
06:14:14.070 --> 06:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
you gave us forms a while ago that told
 
06:14:16.150 --> 06:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
us what percentage each town paid and
 
06:14:18.390 --> 06:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
how much money each town paid on an
 
06:14:20.868 --> 06:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
average house and that was the things i
 
06:14:22.868 --> 06:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
was going from the stuff you passed out
 
06:14:22.878 --> 06:14:24.230 align:start position:0%
was going from the stuff you passed out
earlier

06:14:24.230 --> 06:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
06:14:25.990 --> 06:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
at another time
 
06:14:26.000 --> 06:14:27.990 align:start position:0%
at another time
and

06:14:27.990 --> 06:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:14:30.230 --> 06:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm wondering you know a
 
06:14:34.230 --> 06:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
bunch of us pay that much in our taxes
 
06:14:37.430 --> 06:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
and um and i noticed on that form that
 
06:14:40.150 --> 06:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
yes we we tend to pay on our average
 
06:14:42.628 --> 06:14:42.638 align:start position:0%
house in our town compared to an average
 
06:14:44.390 --> 06:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
house in berlin i don't remember what it
 
06:14:46.868 --> 06:14:46.878 align:start position:0%
was in claremont we tend to pay twice as
 
06:14:49.190 --> 06:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
much because our houses are valued at
 
06:14:51.350 --> 06:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
more but we tend to make twice as much
 
06:14:53.350 --> 06:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
so to me that's equitable
 
06:14:57.030 --> 06:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't see that as a problem
 
06:14:57.040 --> 06:14:58.628 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't see that as a problem
and

06:14:58.628 --> 06:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:15:01.750 --> 06:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
we we pay we pay less but we spend less
 
06:15:04.150 --> 06:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
per pupil in our town than the state
 
06:15:04.160 --> 06:15:05.270 align:start position:0%
per pupil in our town than the state
average

06:15:05.270 --> 06:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
average
 
06:15:07.830 --> 06:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
and we do very well and that's why i'm
 
06:15:09.910 --> 06:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
saying i don't think either property
 
06:15:13.430 --> 06:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
valuation or spending or whatever has a
 
06:15:14.788 --> 06:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
you know that you can draw these
 
06:15:17.190 --> 06:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
conclusions from that
 
06:15:19.590 --> 06:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
um no i mean you can you can draw a lot
 
06:15:21.670 --> 06:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
of conclusions from tax rates
 
06:15:24.948 --> 06:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
and hudson pays uh in 2020 total tax
 
06:15:26.948 --> 06:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
rate was 2137
 
06:15:30.310 --> 06:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
you can't compare rates you have to pair
 
06:15:33.510 --> 06:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
compare amounts
 
06:15:35.190 --> 06:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
no you can compare rates
 
06:15:35.200 --> 06:15:36.310 align:start position:0%
no you can compare rates
they're

06:15:36.310 --> 06:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
they're
 
06:15:38.470 --> 06:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
you absolutely can compare rates
 
06:15:38.480 --> 06:15:42.868 align:start position:0%
you absolutely can compare rates
um

06:15:42.868 --> 06:15:42.878 align:start position:0%

06:15:50.390 --> 06:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's based on equalized valuations but
 
06:15:52.788 --> 06:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
our evaluations are much higher so a
 
06:15:54.628 --> 06:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
slower rate will give you the same
 
06:15:56.788 --> 06:15:56.798 align:start position:0%
amount of money i understand that's why
 
06:15:58.310 --> 06:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that's why i'm saying you
 
06:16:00.628 --> 06:16:00.638 align:start position:0%
have to compare amounts because rates
 
06:16:02.470 --> 06:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
are all totally dependent upon what your
 
06:16:05.190 --> 06:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
valuation so somebody that lives in
 
06:16:09.030 --> 06:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
in in twice the value home in in hudson
 
06:16:12.628 --> 06:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
earning earning a higher um
 
06:16:14.628 --> 06:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
income living on the massachusetts
 
06:16:17.190 --> 06:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
border pays the same amount as somebody
 
06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
living in a home worth half as much uh
 
06:16:21.350 --> 06:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
working in claremont that's what you're
 
06:16:21.360 --> 06:16:24.548 align:start position:0%
working in claremont that's what you're
saying

06:16:24.548 --> 06:16:24.558 align:start position:0%

06:22:10.798 --> 06:22:12.948 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:22:12.948 --> 06:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:22:14.868 --> 06:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
we we had a teacher in the state that
 
06:22:16.628 --> 06:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
had the same credential as the person in
 
06:22:17.830 --> 06:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
the high school
 
06:22:19.670 --> 06:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
but because they were teaching the same
 
06:22:19.680 --> 06:22:20.948 align:start position:0%
but because they were teaching the same
subject

06:22:20.948 --> 06:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
subject
 
06:22:22.548 --> 06:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
in the middle school
 
06:22:24.070 --> 06:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't get any loan forgiveness
 
06:22:25.590 --> 06:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
where the teacher was teaching in the
 
06:22:27.830 --> 06:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
high school got loan forgiveness it's a
 
06:22:30.230 --> 06:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
federal law they're looking at our state
 
06:22:32.788 --> 06:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
other states where they have that by the
 
06:22:34.628 --> 06:22:34.638 align:start position:0%
certification the requirements if they
 
06:22:36.150 --> 06:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
were in the middle school
 
06:22:37.990 --> 06:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
that individual in another state would
 
06:22:40.628 --> 06:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
have gotten loan forgiveness but because
 
06:22:44.390 --> 06:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:46.548 --> 06:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
the the poor teacher in the middle
 
06:22:48.708 --> 06:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
school didn't get any forgiveness same
 
06:22:48.718 --> 06:22:49.910 align:start position:0%
school didn't get any forgiveness same
exact

06:22:49.910 --> 06:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
exact
 
06:22:53.110 --> 06:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
credential teaching the same thing
 
06:22:55.110 --> 06:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
two kids which are prepared for it in
 
06:22:56.948 --> 06:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
the middle school in the eighth grade
 
06:22:58.230 --> 06:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know as we're trying to teach
 
06:23:00.468 --> 06:23:00.478 align:start position:0%
competencies it's something that has to
 
06:23:01.590 --> 06:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
be fixed
 
06:23:03.030 --> 06:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
so it's nothing i don't think that's
 
06:23:05.270 --> 06:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
really off the charts uh we're just
 
06:23:07.990 --> 06:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
trying to assist uh an individual that
 
06:23:08.000 --> 06:23:08.788 align:start position:0%
trying to assist uh an individual that
was

06:23:08.788 --> 06:23:08.798 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:23:10.868 --> 06:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in this state
 
06:23:10.878 --> 06:23:16.150 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in this state
that

06:23:16.150 --> 06:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:18.070 --> 06:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
i believe it's in
 
06:23:21.750 --> 06:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
its statute it's in statute
 
06:23:25.030 --> 06:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
basically a definition problem it's uh
 
06:23:28.708 --> 06:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to modify uh rsa 189
 
06:23:31.430 --> 06:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
colon 25
 
06:23:33.350 --> 06:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
and the sentence what's in this
 
06:23:35.830 --> 06:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
particular non-germain amendment reads
 
06:23:36.788 --> 06:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
as such
 
06:23:39.190 --> 06:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
provided however however that for the
 
06:23:41.350 --> 06:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
purpose of eligibility for state or
 
06:23:43.430 --> 06:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
federal teacher loan forgiveness
 
06:23:43.440 --> 06:23:44.868 align:start position:0%

06:23:44.868 --> 06:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
programs
 
06:23:47.590 --> 06:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
teachers of grades 7 through 12 shall be
 
06:23:50.390 --> 06:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
considered teachers of secondary school
 
06:23:53.030 --> 06:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
let's see in our state k through eight
 
06:23:53.040 --> 06:23:54.868 align:start position:0%
let's see in our state k through eight
elementary

06:23:54.868 --> 06:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
elementary
 
06:23:57.270 --> 06:23:57.280 align:start position:0%

06:23:59.430 --> 06:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
if so if you're an elementary teacher or
 
06:24:00.708 --> 06:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
a middle school teacher you don't get
