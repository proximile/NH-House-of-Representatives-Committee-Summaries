enabling legislation well this is
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
clarifying legislation if i might
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
current law allows parents to opt their
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
child out from specific
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
instruction and to arrange alternate
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
instruction that would be agreed upon
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
between the parent and the school
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
there is some disagreement about the
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
course instruction covered by
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
rsa 186 colon 11
 
00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
and if you want to follow along it's on
 
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.189 align:start position:0%
and if you want to follow along it's on
page

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
30309 in your
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
laws books
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
it has been read by some to apply only
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
to sex education
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
but most view the ability to opt out to
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
any instruction
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
the paragraph prior
 
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.990 align:start position:0%
the paragraph prior
9b

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
9b
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
clearly applies to sex education as in
 
00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:25.589 align:start position:0%
clearly applies to sex education as in
to

00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
indicated in the paragraph heading and
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
the language and i quote from that
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
allowing to an exception to a particular
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
unit of health or sex education
 
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.949 align:start position:0%
unit of health or sex education
instruction

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:38.310 align:start position:0%
instruction
9c

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
9c
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
however is headed
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
require school districts to adopt the
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
policy allowing an exception to specific
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
course material based upon appearance or
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
legal guardian's determination that the
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
material is objectionable
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
the language following
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
simply specifies to notify the school
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
principal or designee in writing of the
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
material to which they object
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
parents have should have the right to
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
have input as to what is being taught to
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
their children
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
to think that they just put their child
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
on the school bus and have no say as to
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
what goes on behind the schoolhouse
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
doors is just plain wrong
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
1015 clarifies that 9c applies to any
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
course of instruction
 
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
and also that adds new language that
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
granting of an alternate
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
alternative to a lesson should not apply
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
to an entire course but just to a
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
specific lesson
 
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.949 align:start position:0%
specific lesson
and

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
what i think was handed out around the
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
committee table
 
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
is a comparison of the current law and
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
on the back is
 
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.509 align:start position:0%
on the back is
hb

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
hb
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
1015 and i tried to break it up into
 
00:09:57.839 --> 00:09:59.030 align:start position:0%
1015 and i tried to break it up into
sections

00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
of the uh law and the proposal so that
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's easier to compare uh language
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh between the two
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
and basically in the
 
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.870 align:start position:0%
and basically in the
uh

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
bill that we are looking at um it
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
removes the uh language
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
for instruction of human sexuality or
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
human sexual education
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
um and inserts the uh paragraph excuse
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
me the sentence at the bottom of the
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh bill
 
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.230 align:start position:0%
uh bill
about

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
that this is uh for a specific lesson
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
and not an entire course that can be
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
opted out
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of clarifying
 
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.509 align:start position:0%
in terms of clarifying
um

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
there is a uh
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
frequently asked question document put
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
out by the department of education
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner for human rights and the
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh last june's hb2
 
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination sections
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
addressing addressing that
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
but also um
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
includes the question can parents or
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
guardians refuse to allow their children
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
to participate in a specific course
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
material and the answer is yes
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
where parents or guardians object to
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
specific more
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
course materials they are encouraged to
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
follow school policies related to
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh 186 11 9c
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh so with that um i thank you very much
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh for your uh attention
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh i do have one question first
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh and i've i've spoken with you about
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:55.350 align:start position:0%
about this
um

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
the area of removing for instruction
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
human sexuality or human sexual
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
education with the two weeks notice i'm
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
i oftentimes am called upon to present
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
at woodsville high school they have a
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
class in military history
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
and as a veteran of vietnam they
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
oftentimes will call me but there might
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
be only like two or three days notice to
 
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.590 align:start position:0%
be only like two or three days notice to
that

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
and and it's sort of sliding people into
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
the schedule who are available it could
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
be the governor that's coming and
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
visiting uh that's all sudden and you
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
would like to have the governor of
 
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.190 align:start position:0%
would like to have the governor of
course

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
speak to kids there's a wonderful
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity there
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
so would this bill then restrict that
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
type of spawn spontaneity that we have
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
in schools to
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
bring in uh
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
portions of instruction that really
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
benefit and take advantage of the moment
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
i i do not believe so
 
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
the current language um also
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
requires the two weeks uh advanced
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
notice um so
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh it would apply
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh currently to uh
 
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.790 align:start position:0%
uh currently to uh
um

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
that same uh issue um i believe um i
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
have not
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
heard of any problems in relation to
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
that and um
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
we are attempting to
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:20.389 align:start position:0%
make sure that
curriculum

00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
materials are available
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
well in advance of two weeks
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
so i don't
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
see that there would be any problem
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
if something comes up in terms of
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
a speaker that is suddenly available or
 
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.870 align:start position:0%
a speaker that is suddenly available or
a

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.829 align:start position:0%
a
topic

00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
related to current events
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
i do not think that there would be an
 
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.790 align:start position:0%
i do not think that there would be an
objection

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
objection
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
to that thank you very much further
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
questions right now and going around the
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
table representative porter
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli um i have
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
two-part question number one
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
the school has to give a two-week notice
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
do the parents have to give any kind of
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
notice ahead of time that their child
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
will not be participating in that lesson
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
yes i think in
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
the statutes there's a
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
provision that the parents
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
or the guardian have to provide
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
a written notification of that with a
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
reason for their objection and follow up
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
on that yes so
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
if i'm in the classroom and i'm teaching
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
a lesson and i have one or two children
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
whose parents object to that lesson what
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
do i do with those children while i'm
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
teaching the lesson
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
there is to be
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
worked out an agreement between the
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
parents in the school as to an
 
00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:39.509 align:start position:0%
parents in the school as to an
alternative

00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
lesson during that time
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
it could be in the library
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
or something else
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
except the library isn't always
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
available for those kinds of things
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
and that's my concern is what do i do
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
with those two kids
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
and who's going to be teaching that
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
lesson to them
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm just wondering if you know how
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
that's handled
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
in various schools
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of that but
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
that is current statue also that
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
it's an agreement between
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
the school and the parents as to what is
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
to be done during that time rep
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative hobson and then
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
representative ellison uh i don't um i
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's appropriate or not i
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
just have a comment about rep porter's
 
00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:21.110 align:start position:0%
just have a comment about rep porter's
question

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
um there's a provision on line nine that
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
answers that i don't know if you saw it
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.670 align:start position:0%
or not
but

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
just the basics of how to handle it
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
that was not a question for the
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
for the presenter representative ellison
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
looking at lines six through eight
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh on the bill
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
by removing human sexuality and human
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
sexual education
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
and sort of making the bill applicable
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
to anything
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
are we asking that
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
every single course at any level
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
in a school all of those curriculum
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
materials must be made available to
 
00:16:08.079 --> 00:16:09.030 align:start position:0%
materials must be made available to
parents

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
at any given time we asking the
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
kindergarten teacher to send out her
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
materials on reading and math and so on
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
it i think or i ask you do we open that
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
up that possibility by removing the
 
00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:25.509 align:start position:0%
up that possibility by removing the
specific

00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
reference to human sexuality and human
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
sexual education
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
i believe that the
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
applies more broadly than that and my
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
attempt here is to clarify that that is
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
the intent of the law
 
00:16:42.079 --> 00:16:44.230 align:start position:0%
the intent of the law
um

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.910 align:start position:0%
um
i

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.710 align:start position:0%
i
uh

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you then uh
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli do you recall
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
that when we've had discussion on this
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
particular statute in the past
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
we've had questions asked do do i have
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
to have a two week you can have this all
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
curriculum delivered to parents online
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the school year is
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
that correct uh that is correct and i i
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
we've seen or are in the process of
 
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.549 align:start position:0%
we've seen or are in the process of
seeing

00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:15.510 align:start position:0%
seeing
several

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
several
 
00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0%
bills clarifying that curriculum needs
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
to be made available to parents
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions of
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
representing court yes representative
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%

00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:28.150 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
i want to speak to your statement that
 
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.350 align:start position:0%
i want to speak to your statement that
that

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
parents send their kids off to school
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
and um they have no say in what happens
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
behind closed doors was the was the
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
quote i believe and i would like you to
 
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.029 align:start position:0%
quote i believe and i would like you to
um

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:44.310 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.110 align:start position:0%
uh
know

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
from my point of view that uh that did
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
not happen uh any parent that came in
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
that asked for things got it but i was
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if you had
 
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.390 align:start position:0%
wondering if you had
um

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
an idea of how how often that happens in
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
i i believe my comment was that they
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
i i do not know
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
how many times
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
that occurs but
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
certainly there have been times when
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
parents have requested materials and
 
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.230 align:start position:0%
parents have requested materials and
have

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.110 align:start position:0%
have
received

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.510 align:start position:0%
 
not

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
all the information that's requested or
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
objections to providing the materials
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
that are available
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
yes may
 
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.110 align:start position:0%
yes may
um

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
do you believe that most schools have a
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
policy in place um
 
00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:47.750 align:start position:0%
policy in place um
for

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh parents coming in or parents
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
requesting or objecting to materials
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
after particularly after this law was
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
first written
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know when a new
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
statute is
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
passed and signed
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
there should be a
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mullen
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
the way i read uh 1015 is not that the
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum needs to be put online at the
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year what i'm reading
 
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.270 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year what i'm reading
is

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
shall require the school district or
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher to provide parents and
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
legal guardians not less than two weeks
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
advance notice of
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum course material and to me
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
that speaks to
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
readings written assignments the
 
00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:50.150 align:start position:0%
worksheet that's going to be handed out
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:51.270 align:start position:0%
worksheet that's going to be handed out
[Music]

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.270 align:start position:0%
[Music]
so

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
are are you concerned at all that you're
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
sort of hobbling classroom teachers to
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
making a decision and then what happens
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
if within 10 days of the lesson they
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
discover materials that they consider
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
are better
 
00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:09.830 align:start position:0%
are better
um

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question but that is
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
that is current law
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
so um i i would expect that they are uh
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with that now and uh i don't
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
think that uh if they uh
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh alter a lesson plan or change the
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
sequence of a lesson um i i do not think
 
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.070 align:start position:0%
sequence of a lesson um i i do not think
that

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up
 
00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:37.510 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up
uh

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
the current law specifies human
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
sexuality and reproduction and and uh
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh are
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
are you saying that we already have in
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
place a statute that requires all
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
materials that are being used by all
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers to be available two
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
weeks in advance
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
i think that the current 186 11 9c does
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
provide for that um in that
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
looking at the title of the uh
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
section um as well as the uh detailed
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
language um and it further uh
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
down in the um the paragraph says um
 
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.390 align:start position:0%
down in the um the paragraph says um
uh

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
that it would also cover
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
sexual um educational materials the word
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
also was in there
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
and then represent thank you um
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
as a as a teacher uh what do you think
 
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.590 align:start position:0%
as a as a teacher uh what do you think
um

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
i guess yeah what do you think a teacher
 
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.190 align:start position:0%
i guess yeah what do you think a teacher
does

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh in order to prepare
 
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.870 align:start position:0%
uh in order to prepare
for

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh usually just the next week
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
there's there's usually a unit plan
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
where you
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
similar to what
 
00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.310 align:start position:0%
similar to what
representative representative

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
uhlery gave us for the
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
civics the civil rights
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
but then uh lesson plans are usually
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
drawn up uh
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
a week in advance i i would say is
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
probably normal what do you expect to
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
see in a teacher's lesson plans
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
how do they then extend them to two
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
weeks out because if you don't cover
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
some of the material one day
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
or if the student doesn't understand the
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
material one day
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
bulk of the students then oftentimes
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
your lesson plans are
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
junked in the paper and you start out
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
again uh revising what what you did so
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
what do you expect
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
would be let's say you went in and
 
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.830 align:start position:0%
would be let's say you went in and
objected

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
objected
 
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.789 align:start position:0%
objected
to

00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:51.830 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
something other than human sexuality
 
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.350 align:start position:0%
something other than human sexuality
which

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
again i taught and we had numerous times
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
when people came in
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
um but let's say uh you you objected to
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh in high school literacy literature um
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
literature class the discussion of
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
of maybe a movie they saw like
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
schindler's list
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
okay what would you expect the two-week
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
in your
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
two weeks of lesson plans
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh i would think um that in the
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum materials
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
that should be available made
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
made available
 
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.870 align:start position:0%
made available
to

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
parents at the beginning of the year
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
materials such as
 
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.110 align:start position:0%
materials such as
films

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
films
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
recordings things like that would be uh
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
included in that
 
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.549 align:start position:0%
included in that
um

00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know and i'll go back to an example
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
that i think i mentioned one time here
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
back in connecticut when i was a school
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
board they wanted to show the godfather
 
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.549 align:start position:0%
board they wanted to show the godfather
movie

00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
movie
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
as an illustration of early 20th century
 
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.350 align:start position:0%
as an illustration of early 20th century
america

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
america
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
if that had
 
00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.510 align:start position:0%
if that had
been

00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
passed by the board
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
i certainly think that that
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
should have been um notified to the
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
parents in terms of um the curriculum
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
that was going to be um for that course
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
so that the parents could see
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
um that movie was going to be shown and
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
i know i would have gone in and objected
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
to that movie being shown and i i think
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
it would be perfectly within my rights
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
and my responsibility as i see it as a
 
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
and my responsibility as i see it as a
parent

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
could i have a follow-up to that we we
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
have a uh some other questions here and
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
we're running a little tight here so
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'll come back to you if um we have that
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
time represent hobson
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
or represent like us excuse me
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
mine is sort of a follow-on to
 
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.990 align:start position:0%
mine is sort of a follow-on to
reptanters

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
reptanters
 
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.590 align:start position:0%
reptanters
um

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
as to how detailed
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
the material needs to be is it just like
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
when i was teaching math was it just the
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
math book or i for instance based on
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
what my students were having trouble
 
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.029 align:start position:0%
what my students were having trouble
with

00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
wrote up my own problem sets and
 
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
wrote up my own problem sets and
everything

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
to address the particular things they
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
were in trouble with and i would often
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
do that the night before
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
based on what happened that day in class
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering how detailed
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know this actually is expected to be
 
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.149 align:start position:0%
you know this actually is expected to be
um

00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
i think that the current
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
language in the bill now
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
um discusses curriculum course material
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think that it has to be every um
 
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.549 align:start position:0%
i don't think that it has to be every um
worksheet

00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
worksheet
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
um as you um mentioned um would have to
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
be included in that in terms of the
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
material that is uh made available to
 
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.310 align:start position:0%
material that is uh made available to
parents

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further questions
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
represent tanner you have one now
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
yes i do i want to um thank you
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
representative lakers for kind of
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
following up on that but i just want to
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
make it clear
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
what you expect teachers to turn over
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
two weeks in advance if i'm if i have a
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
student teacher i'll i'll take it from a
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
point where i actually taught student
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
teachers or had student teachers come
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
with me okay they had to set goals for
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
each day
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
they had to set talk about how it
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
related to the particular competency or
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
whatever we were doing
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
they had to
 
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.350 align:start position:0%
they had to
outline

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
outline
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
usually by
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
by a period of time like i'm going to
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
spend five minutes getting the kids
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
warmed up we're going to talk about
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
maybe ask some questions on you know
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
what's your favorite food then the next
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
10 minutes maybe we're going to do
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh a b and c
 
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.149 align:start position:0%
uh a b and c
um

00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
give them a time a period to get
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
together to discuss what we've gone over
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
etc etc and then at the end homework for
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
the next day or you know what we're
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
going to do for the next day and again
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
usually that evening
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
or right after that class you jot some
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
notes down as a teacher
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
what went well what didn't go well and
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
then how you're going to reform
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
the lesson plan for the next day so so
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
those are the things that that i see
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
as curriculum materials and instruction
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
materials i guess instruction materials
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
is that what you expect teachers
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
to present to parents if they just go in
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
and say
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
oh you have a unit on
 
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:28.950 align:start position:0%
oh you have a unit on
um

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know whatever uh certainly human
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
sexuality like is a blinking red flag
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
on anything and that they want exactly
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
what you're going to do i i really think
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh you need to know what you're asking
 
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.470 align:start position:0%
uh you need to know what you're asking
for

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.510 align:start position:0%
for
um

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
again that is
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
part of current law um in terms of uh
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh some of the things you mentioned i i
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
think that that goes beyond what would
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
be expected but certainly in terms of uh
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
uh human sexuality
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
if they're doing
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
certain types of
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrations or
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
film strips even i would expect that
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
available to parents and i think that
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
parents have a right to know what's
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
going in the classroom and it should be
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
well in advance of two weeks
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum materials should be available
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the school year
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
every school year
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much either further quite
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
my question so
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
i'm new to this but
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me that you keep saying
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
everything is current law
 
00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.110 align:start position:0%
everything is current law
so

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
what is not current law
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know you're taking out the
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
right um you could explain that right
 
00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:54.870 align:start position:0%
right um you could explain that right
sure

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
um does um include the two weeks notice
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
right of curriculum materials
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
what i am removing is this uh
 
00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.830 align:start position:0%
what i am removing is this uh
section

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
or the phrase below that um about uh
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
instruction for human sexuality and
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
sexual education
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
um and adding that um it is not expected
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
that a parent would uh be able to opt
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
out of an entire entire course like they
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't opt out of
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
english 101
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
but a particular lesson but your
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation right now is that
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
teachers should be
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
always giving two weeks notice for
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
anything they teach
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
all the classroom materials is that what
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
that phrase is in current law currently
 
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.310 align:start position:0%
that phrase is in current law currently
yes

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
i i hear that you're saying that this is
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
already in current law though i don't
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
know that this is current practice that
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers are providing
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
materials two weeks ahead of time
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
and i certainly understand the
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
sensitivity of teaching human sexuality
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
and why that would be something that
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
parents would want you know advanced
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
notice of i have no problem with that
 
00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.789 align:start position:0%
notice of i have no problem with that
whatsoever

00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
but how am i as a classroom teacher
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
supposed to determine what you find
 
00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:34.950 align:start position:0%
supposed to determine what you find
objectionable

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
objectionable
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that you would have to
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
try and read my mind
 
00:30:39.679 --> 00:30:42.230 align:start position:0%
try and read my mind
um

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully you
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
can't very often um
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think you have to be a mind
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
reader as long as the information is
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
available to parents and they can make
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
their own determination as to
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
all right thank you you're welcome are
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%

i am a pastor with the united church of
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
christ um which is the old
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
congregational churches that people are
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
probably more familiar with that term
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's the the united church of christ is
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
the largest protestant denomination in
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
i am also a former school counselor
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
a former school board member and former
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
school board chair and also former chair
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
of a school administrative unit
 
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.990 align:start position:0%
of a school administrative unit
board

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
so i just want to say generally that
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
this particular bill is uh
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
completely from my multiple perspectives
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
including my faith perspective but also
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
my educator perspective um
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
completely unworkable and chaos inducing
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
and i want to first start by saying that
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
i after i saw this bill
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
i went back and looked at current law i
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
printed it out i read it and i reread it
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
and i reread it to try to understand
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
what it was doing versus what this bill
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
is doing
 
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.830 align:start position:0%
is doing
and

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
despite what has been said the um the
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
particular provision that is being uh
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
for which this bill is going to
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
substitute what's currently in law
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
that that particular um piece of statute
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
starts off with just some general
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
verbiage about that school districts
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
need to have policies
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
about how students can object to
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
material and then it goes on and is very
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
specific and it says this policy
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
shall also require the school district
 
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
or classroom teacher to provide parents
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
and legal guardians not less than two
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
weeks advance notice of curriculum
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
course material
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
used for instruction of human sexuality
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
or human sexual education that is
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
specific the beginning is general this
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
particular current statute says two
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
weeks notice only only only
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
on for
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
teaching of human sexuality or sex
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
education it does not cover anything
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
else in the curriculum in terms of a two
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
weeks notice but
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
the current bill before you 10 15
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
does in fact um require two weeks notice
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
of everything
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
and it's not clear what that means it's
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
not clear at all that's a part of why
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
this is chaos inducing in my perspective
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
but think about that for a minute
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
beyond the first two weeks of school in
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
every any given school year
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
the two-week clock starts ticking
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
and so it's like every day from that
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
point onward if if a teacher is coming
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
up with new classroom material for
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
whatever reason including the question
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
about something that's happened
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
currently or a speaker that comes in is
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
made available
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
that is something that according to this
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
required that that that
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
that information has to be posted again
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
and if it's every class think about the
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
chaos of every teacher having to post
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
new things uh to to meet the the
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
two-week requirement because
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
that is not what the current law says
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
but that's what 1015 says um
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
the other things i think very
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
specifically that this committee needs
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
to ask itself is what does objectionable
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
mean and who
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
decides and also the the
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
house bill 1015 ends with the words of
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
that uh that there there can be you can
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
require um an alternative course
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
for any lesson that violates a student's
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
convictions and i just said what does
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
that mean and i just want to think back
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
i was a feisty student in my day and
 
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.829 align:start position:0%
i was a feisty student in my day and
frankly

00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
i had a very strong conviction that i
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to to be part of a
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
biology class if i had to dissect a frog
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know that violated my conviction
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
and that their my conviction that i
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
should not do that but there's so
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
such a lacking of um
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
of specificity here number one but
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
number two
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
just the uh
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
it makes no sense it is completely
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
unworkable and if there's this ongoing
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
thing of two weeks notice for classroom
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
material meaning things that are
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
introduced in the classroom
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
who's going to do that how much time is
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
it going to take on for every class and
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
then how much is it going to cost the
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
school district to comply with the way
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
this particular bill is written and if
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
there is a cost factor of constantly
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
every two weeks of
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
introducing a letting uh letting there
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
be notice of every every worksheet every
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
film every speaker etc um
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
that cost it strikes me is also an
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate but again i would say i
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
i implore you from my multiple
 
00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.550 align:start position:0%
i implore you from my multiple
perspectives

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
perspectives
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
this is a bill um in search of a problem
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist number one this is a
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
bill that's completely unworkable this
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
is a bill that would create chaos for
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
teachers and
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
it it just it screams
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
despite us perhaps well-intent it
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
screams and expedient to legislate so i
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
implore you
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
please do just that with this particular
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
bill thank you so much thank you very
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony uh are there
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
questions of the reverend
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i will leave the um the current law
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
do you have written uh do you have

tuttle for the record president nea new
hampshire

00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
representing more than 17 000 educators
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
in the state of
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and a 8th grade social
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
studies teacher there's really just two
 
00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
kind of points i guess i want to make on
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
this or two questions
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
good teachers adjust their lessons daily
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
they look at what happened during the
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
day any any grade level kindergarten
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
through higher ed they do the same thing
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
so you look at what happened during the
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
day whether it's a block schedule you
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
know whole class whatever it is and you
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
reflect on it and you adjust your lesson
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
the next day based on that
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
what's happening or what you plan two
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
weeks in advance isn't always what's
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
going to be happening in the classroom
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
an example of this could be current
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
events and so i taught 8th grade social
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
studies for 18 years current events was
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
part of what i had to teach as a social
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
studies teacher and those you can't plan
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
two weeks in advance if something is
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
going to be objectionable to a parent
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
and you have to let them know two weeks
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
ahead of time just for example
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
an article that comes out in the boston
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
globe or the monitor or any newspaper
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
you want to pick or
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
cnn has i apologize i can't remember
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
what it's called but it's a 10-minute
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
news segment that's made just for
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
students other stations might have the
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
same thing i did use that in the
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
classroom we watched the 10 minutes of
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
what was going on and then we talked
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
about what the current events were the
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
kids would pick something and they would
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
write a reflection on it they'd write
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
you know at that point it was five
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
sentences on what they thought and then
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
we picked one of the current events to
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
talk about that was something i had to
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
do as part of being a social studies
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
teacher that you can't plan two weeks in
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
advance and that's kind of a problem
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's a big problem you can plan out your
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
units and i always had a curriculum map
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
in the beginning of the the year saying
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
these are the units that i'm teaching or
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
the themes that i'm going to be teaching
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
but the specific course material to have
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
it for two weeks in advance is really
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
hard to do because it's just not
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable it's not natural for what
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
good teachers do they reflect daily and
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
they they adjust their plans based on
 
00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:29.670 align:start position:0%
they they adjust their plans based on
that

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.270 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh i got a question
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
when i was a school administrator
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
elementary grades k through 8.
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
we had every morning after our morning
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
exercises a student would come down and
 
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
we'd do our daily oral
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
geography we'd talk about a place or an
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
event in geography it could have been
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
human movement it could have been
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
physical geography etc very simple we
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
is there a difference between
 
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.349 align:start position:0%
is there a difference between
curriculum

00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
describing this area that we were doing
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
daily oral geography and specific
 
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.990 align:start position:0%
daily oral geography and specific
instruction

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.030 align:start position:0%
instruction
which

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
follows and supports those objectives
 
00:40:18.319 --> 00:40:19.190 align:start position:0%
follows and supports those objectives
but

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
can be changing
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
uh at the
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
moment thank you for the question i
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
think you know i think they're they're
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
the curriculum i see it is what you're
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
the kind of broad things you're going to
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
be teaching um the instruction could
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
change daily as you're saying the way i
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
read this is you have to have the
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
materials which to me if it says the
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum course material to be used to
 
00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.390 align:start position:0%
curriculum course material to be used to
me

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
that says you have to give the parents
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
two weeks notice of everything you're
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
using in your class so it could be part
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
of instruction is how i'm reading this
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
which i just don't think is realistic
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
so a follow-up uh
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
so if i were talking today about daily
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
current events and talking about
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
the ukraine
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
what what may happen would could i be in
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
in your interpretation could that be
 
00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.270 align:start position:0%
in your interpretation could that be
done

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
according to this
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
you could talk i think you could talk
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
about it but i don't think you could
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
give two weeks well no actually the way
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
i'm interpreting this is you don't know
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
two weeks ahead of time that there's
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
going to be a story on the ukraine
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
today so you might not be able to be
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
talking about it depending on where you
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
got the story from or something like
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
that if i'm understanding your question
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get there there's a
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
there's really pillars in in getting
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
everything aligned in school curriculum
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
instruction right accountability
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
and instruction and career and and
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum are two separate components
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
of that stool and
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
we could have written in at the
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
beginning of your parents know we're
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
going to be doing daily oral current
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
events in geography
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
there that's that's the curriculum with
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
objectives of why we're doing it and we
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
could go down to some of those broad
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
themes within those two care areas
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have to know that we're doing
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
an event today on on ukraine
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
how you might interpret it thank you
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
sort of the way
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
where we are i know the the way i'm
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
interpreting this is that a parent can
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
opt out or
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
have their child not be part of the
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
lesson because the material is
 
00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.109 align:start position:0%
lesson because the material is
objectionable

00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
objectionable
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
and i think i'm interpreting that
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
correctly for this
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
my point is that
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
we don't always know what the material
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
is going to be if it's a current event
 
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.710 align:start position:0%
is going to be if it's a current event
so

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
would the parent then opt out of every
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
time you do a current event because in
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the year you're saying
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
you're doing current events i think
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's where i'm getting
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
my interpretation is that you
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
parents that could object to a lot of
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
current events today i don't think
 
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.390 align:start position:0%
current events today i don't think
that's

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think anybody could
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
disagree with that there are so many
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
topics coming up daily that are so
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
divisive everybody split on it um
 
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.069 align:start position:0%
divisive everybody split on it um
and

00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
two weeks ahead of time we don't know
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
what the daily news is going to be
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
so i think you know the way we're
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
reading this is it's specific course
 
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:18.870 align:start position:0%
reading this is it's specific course
material

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
material
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
and it has curriculum course material i
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
just i don't think that this is doable
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
or workable or reasonable
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
for any educator in new hampshire right
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
now to give two weeks
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
notice of everything that's going to be
 
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.670 align:start position:0%
notice of everything that's going to be
used

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
i mean there are certain so when i
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
i am
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
completely blanking it we did um i'm so
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
sorry we did we there were lessons that
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
i could plan out a month ahead of time
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
because we did um
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
different layers or different levels so
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
the the bottom level of like the
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
triangle was the base knowledge and you
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
know the next level they would apply it
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
and the top level was
 
00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.270 align:start position:0%
and the top level was
the

00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
essential questions for the unit
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
and there is a word for it and i'm
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
completely blanking on what the word is
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
right now but anyway that was something
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
that we did a month and a half in
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
advance and all that was there
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
but that didn't include daily current
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
events it didn't include you know other
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
things that might come up and so the
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
point here is it's you can't always have
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
the two-week notice of every single
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
thing that's going to be happening
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
because if you're a good teacher you're
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
reflecting on everything that happens
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
daily and changing it like
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative lake has said you know
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
making up things if the kids don't
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
understand something you're going to
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
come up with something to help them the
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
next day but it might not be something
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
that you originally planned two weeks
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
ago when you planned your broad lessons
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you i got it okay
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative ellison
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
ah thank you mr chair uh
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
again just a quick question
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill as as presented
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me that
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
it requires
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
every third grade teacher in the state
 
00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.069 align:start position:0%
every third grade teacher in the state
to

00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
put out their curriculum materials two
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
weeks in advance for anything that they
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
would be teaching in the next two weeks
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you yes i would agree with that
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:11.030 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
tanner

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
tanner
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
um could
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
your statement that it's very hard to
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
realize what people will object to
 
00:45:19.599 --> 00:45:20.870 align:start position:0%
realize what people will object to
and

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if
 
00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.309 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if
if

00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
it seems like this
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to be
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
proactive on
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
objectionability um
 
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.589 align:start position:0%
objectionability um
but

00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
what do you see happens if the objection
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
comes from what actually happens in the
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
class in other words you give the
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum and you've got the current
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
events and all of a sudden the kid goes
 
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.750 align:start position:0%
events and all of a sudden the kid goes
home

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
student goes home
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
and says you know we talked about this
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
today and the parent says well i object
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
how how do you feel that this
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
fits into this bill and and
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
how is this
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
bill going to eliminate the possibility
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
of that happening
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um i don't
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
know that it would eliminate the
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
possibility the the way i'm reading this
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
bill is if
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
the current event wouldn't even be
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
talked about and the child wouldn't have
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to go home and say and
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
have the parents say object to it
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
because it wouldn't have come out two
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
weeks ahead of time
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm not even sure that it would
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
would be able to happen that way
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
i think you know if
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
the child goes home and tells a parent
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
what they talked about or what they did
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
in class that day i mean
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
in an ideal world the parent would get a
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
hold of the teacher and ask them what
 
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.750 align:start position:0%
hold of the teacher and ask them what
happened

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
and have them talk about it but
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
according to this i don't even know that
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
they would have that option because it
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be out two weeks in advance
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
because we don't know what's happening
 
00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
two weeks from now
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
so i have a daughter who's a first grade
 
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
teacher in boston and she had a parent
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
object this year to circle time because
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
circles are a pagan ritual all right
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
would something like that be covered by
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
um i don't know that i could thank you
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
for the question i don't know that i
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
could answer that i think it would be a
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
question for the sponsor of it because
 
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure of the intent when the bill
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
further questions represent boom
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
to curriculum for example in your
 
00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.750 align:start position:0%
to curriculum for example in your
and

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative ladd's
 
00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.390 align:start position:0%
representative ladd's
question

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
is the curriculum stat says could say
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
current events
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
and we're going to use cnn
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
now i would think a lot of parents will
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
be objectionable to using cnn not the
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
current events just
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
what the source was
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
i mean do you agree that could be an
 
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.309 align:start position:0%
i mean do you agree that could be an
issue

00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
thank you i think parents could object
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
to anything they could object to the
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
boston globe they could object to cnn
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
they could object to fox news they could
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
they could object to anything but that's
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you miss tuttle
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
um maybe
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
earlier on i asked what happens in my
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
classroom my second grade classroom when
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
i have a 45 minute lesson that a parent
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
has objected to and i have two children
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
whose parents objected what do
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
do i do with those two children
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
if the library isn't available if the
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
other classes are not available to to
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
absorb them even though it says in the
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
law that the parents have to pay for it
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
are the parents going to come in for 45
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
minutes and watch the children while i
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
teach the rest of them and i'm wondering
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
if you know how that kind of stuff
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
in current currently is going on and if
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know what do parents do what does
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
teachers do when a child is a parents
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
have objected to something where is the
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
child and what who is giving them
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
instruction do you know thank you for
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
the question um no
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know there's i mean we could
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
theoretically say they could go to the
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
library but like you said it's not
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
always available or there might not be
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
someone watching them you don't want to
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
put them in you know you can't put them
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
in the hallway you can't put them where
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
i taught in pembroke the last school
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
that i was in i was the only eighth
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
grade social studies teacher so
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's not like i could put them in
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
another social studies classroom for a
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
different lesson or something i was at
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
that that that was me
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
honestly don't know
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
where they would go or what they would
 
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.829 align:start position:0%
where they would go or what they would
do

00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
oh have you reversed halloween yourself

here thank you for taking my question so
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
you represent as you said 17 000
 
00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.549 align:start position:0%
you represent as you said 17 000
teachers

00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
and according to representative cordelli
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
that this is in law already it's current
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
law that we have to do this have you
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
heard i mean i know from
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
40 years in the in the classroom that
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
if people are really up in arms about
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
something you're going to hear about it
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
is this something you've heard from all
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
your educators that they are wild that
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
this is current law of like back
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
um thanks for the question no
 
00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.069 align:start position:0%
um thanks for the question no
okay

00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%

litchfield
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:50:14.559 --> 00:50:17.190 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
i know that has been mentioned that this
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
bill probably has very good intent
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
and i know when i first heard about this
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill i envisioned it a little bit
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
different although i'm not in the
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
classroom every day and i had looked at
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
it more as though
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
that year for the english curriculum we
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
plan on reading these particular books
 
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
or we plan on having these particular
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
speakers which granted they could be
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
last minute um so
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
me interpreting in that way i'm just
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
wondering is there a way even is give
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
thoughts on how we could make this
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
better um that would satisfy most
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
parties so you know maybe it would be
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
fair to say that the parents have to
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
seek out the information in some cases
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
where if we're going to have a speaker
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
we post it online you know taking some
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
of this pressure off of the teachers
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
but my question to you is also could it
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
be less than two weeks notice or
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
what could we do to make this you look
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
puzzled so
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully you're allowed to ask
 
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.069 align:start position:0%
hopefully you're allowed to ask
questions

00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
no i'm just wondering because i
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
understand the intent and as a parent i
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
completely appreciate it because there
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
are times when i've held a child back
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
and said you know what that's really not
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
something that's something that we
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
discuss in the home so i can appreciate
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
that so i'm just wondering if you have
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
ideas having been in the classroom what
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
could we do to make this better thank
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
you um i think you know and i'm a parent
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
too i have three kids in the public
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
school system grades three five and um
 
00:51:41.359 --> 00:51:42.150 align:start position:0%
school system grades three five and um
nine

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.670 align:start position:0%
nine
um

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.870 align:start position:0%
um
i

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
the way i'm interpreting this isn't what
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting i think putting out in
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the year as you said
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
for as an english teacher these are the
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
books we're going to be reading i think
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's completely reasonable to do and i
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
know that every open house that i ever
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
did for any you know any school i was in
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
keene pembroke whatever
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
i did all that and we all had to do that
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
we had to put out our list of either
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
books we were going to read or we had to
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
put out what units we were going to be
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
teaching for me it was usually 1800 to
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
reconstruction and so we put that out
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that's what this says
 
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.030 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that's what this says
though

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
and i think it's two different things so
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
to make this better would be not to have
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
the two weeks it wouldn't be to have all
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
the curriculum material in there i think
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
it's a different um it's a different
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
bill or a different topic to just say
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
and i think i believe there is a bill
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
later this afternoon about putting out
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
by november 1st i think
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
your curriculum for the year i think
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
that's there's one coming up on that
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
unless i'm mistaken so i don't know if
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's going more towards what you're
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
asking for um but again our intent or
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry our interpretation of this is
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
that the two weeks is just not
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
reasonable for everything that could
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
happen in a classroom if you're a good
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
teacher and you're doing that reflection
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with putting out your your
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
topics for the year i think you should
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
be doing that i think that's a very
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
positive thing to do and it just it lets
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
everybody know what's happening and
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know and and the other piece of that
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
too is you know as a parent i welcome
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
them in my classroom anytime the
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
principals other teachers you want to
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
come in and see what we're doing come on
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
in more of the merrier um it's hard to
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
do that now with getting into the
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
classroom but you know so
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answered a little bit
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
further questions we have several more
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
speakers here coming up represent tanner
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for letting me have the
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
question i just wondered uh
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
megan what role the
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
building principle or the principal
 
00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.030 align:start position:0%
building principle or the principal
plays

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
plays
 
00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:43.990 align:start position:0%
plays
in

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:44.950 align:start position:0%
in
checking

00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
checking
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
that you know someone doesn't go off the
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
deep end um i know i always went to my
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
principal because they have your back
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm just wondering uh
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
which what you see as the role of the
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
principal the administrator in the
 
00:53:58.079 --> 00:53:59.190 align:start position:0%
principal the administrator in the
building

00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
um according to this thank you for the
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
question i do see the administrator as
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
having a big role in it because
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
um they should be checking that this is
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
done i know that for my own personal
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
experience when i was in the classroom
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
we had 10 minute walkthroughs so my
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
principal would be in the classroom a
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
lot just walking through checking in
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
you know i think it also depends on the
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
size of the school i think it's going to
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
be almost a burden on a lot of
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
administrators if you have a large
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
school and a lot of staff to make sure
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
that they're doing this constantly i
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
for further
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
yes representatives
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:35.829 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if there was a
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
definition of course material put in if
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
do you think that would help
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question i would
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
have to see it
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
to see no but i mean just definitely i
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
think it would help clear it up what was
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
intended right i think it could help
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay further questions
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%

yesterday's no no that's that's it's a
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
important topic and i do have written
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%

someone's calling on me for the first
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
time because they're not sure how to

thank you for allowing me to come here
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
and speak today on this
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
very important bill
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
i will be completely up front and say
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
that i am in support of this bill
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
as it is written
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
um i've had a lot of uh experience both
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
as a parent an educator and a
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
grandparent regarding um some of the
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
problems that have come up over the
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
years with students and classroom
 
00:56:04.319 --> 00:56:06.390 align:start position:0%
years with students and classroom
curriculum

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
this bill speaks it's
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
the only thing we're really taking out
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill is specific to sexual
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
education as some of the previous
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
speakers uh spoke earlier
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
they said that a lot of things are
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
controversial right now well when this
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
bill was written it was sexual education
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
that was controversial now everything is
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
controversial the bottom line is is that
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
i look at this bill as an opportunity
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
for teachers to engage closer with
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
parents because parents now have the
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility of saying no i don't want
 
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
it and why
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
um that they're they're more engaged
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
that's something that teachers have been
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
complaining about for years and years
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
and years that there is absolutely no
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
engagement from the parents they should
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
they should be welcoming and welcoming
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
welcoming the parents um in the parents
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
involvement in their students education
 
00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.270 align:start position:0%
involvement in their students education
um

00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
there is more transparency if you
 
00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:06.950 align:start position:0%
there is more transparency if you
provide

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of goods a lot of schools do now
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
they provide the curriculum at the
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
beginning usually by
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
the the usually before the start of the
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
school year back in my day my parents
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
knew that i was reading dick and jane
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
long before i ever started going to
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
school because that was the school
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
identified that for the parents
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
it also allows the student to process
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
with the parents
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
what happened during the day
 
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
so you don't have that reactive
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
situation going on when a student comes
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
home and says oh actually i have an
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
example my child was in kindergarten she
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
came home and she said and i asked her
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
how was school that's what we call it
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
was preschool actually she said didn't
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
like it
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
i asked why she said scary man
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
scary man came scary man talked about
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
scary things scary man took me to a
 
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
scary place
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
this was at the same time that the
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
daycares in massachusetts who are being
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
brought up on sexual abuse allegations
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
i was in a roar
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
it took us a week and a half to figure
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
out scary man was officer friendly
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
and he talked about stranger danger
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
because my daughter wouldn't talk about
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
it she was that frightened so what is
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
important to one person may not be
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
important in weather what is traumatic
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
to one person may not be traumatic to
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
another um if you have a sexually
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
reactive child the last thing you want
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
to be doing is doing certain things in a
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
classroom that's going to trigger that
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
and then the parents have to respond to
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
that when that child goes home and they
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
have no idea what happened
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
so it's very important that
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
that teachers and parents develop a
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
relationship um i think once upon a time
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
we had that i think over over the time
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
of becoming busy and two-parent
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
household to working you know no parent
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
in the home um that we've gotten away
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
with that but it's we've gotten away
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
from that but it's time to get back to
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
it it's time to get back to that
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
collaboration that student is a student
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
but it's also a child and that child the
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
parent has a responsibility for raising
 
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
that child and the teacher has a
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility for educating that child
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
that should be a collaboration that
 
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
should be a community bringing that
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
child together and raising the child up
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
for success with regards to the two
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
weeks um advance notice it's already in
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is is that if you're
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
going to for instance let's take the
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
current events issue i'm going to talk
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
about current events and i'm going to
 
00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.349 align:start position:0%
about current events and i'm going to
use

00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
cnn and
 
00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.630 align:start position:0%
cnn and
newsmax

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
newsmax
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
for my current events if if a teacher if
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
if a parent has a problem with this
 
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.870 align:start position:0%
if a parent has a problem with this
cnn

00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
cnn
 
00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.150 align:start position:0%
cnn
curriculum

00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
and doesn't have a problem with newsmax
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
correct as long as both sides are being
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
presented the parent doesn't have the
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
argument that they had it also allows
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
for especially right now with what's
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
going on my grandchild came home from
 
01:00:13.119 --> 01:00:14.710 align:start position:0%
going on my grandchild came home from
daycare

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
daycare
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
really upset
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
i knew she was upset i asked her why she
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
said i have to hate i have to choose and
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
i said choose what she says
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
i can't be milk chocolate anymore
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
my granddaughter's biracial
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
we taught her that i'm white chocolate
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
her mom's white chocolate her dad's dark
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
chocolate and she's milk chocolate she
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
came home bawling really upset she says
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
i can't be milk chocolate anymore i have
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
to choose whether i'm black or whether
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm white and if i choose black i have
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
to hate you and mommy
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
now that's
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
now that's what she took
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
from what she was taught
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
had i been given the opportunity to know
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
that that was going on on in the
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
classroom i could have done one of two
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
things i could have said i don't agree
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
with that or i could have said
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
i could have prepared her for it so that
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
she wouldn't have misunderstood and
 
01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted the lesson plan
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
that's why this is this bill is so
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
important it puts the responsibility
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
back on parents it takes some of the
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility off of the teachers and
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
some of the the re
 
01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.270 align:start position:0%
some of the the re
re-uh

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
re-uh
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
retaliation you know if we know what's
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
going on in this if you're telling us in
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
advance if you're being transparent the
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
likelihood that we're going to get
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
really angry with you as a parent is a
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
lot less likely the likelihood that
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to come to you and say my
 
01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.750 align:start position:0%
we're going to come to you and say my
child

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
said this
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
can we talk about it
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
it won't be
 
01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:54.039 align:start position:0%
a situation that's attacking and and
 
01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
accusatory it'll be a collaboration
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
it'll be a true
 
01:01:59.839 --> 01:02:00.950 align:start position:0%
it'll be a true
true

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
true
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
rearing and appropriate upbringing of
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
the child in the whole child not just
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
the not just the student
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
not just the the good human being but
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
the entire child by having that
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
relationship between a parent and a
 
01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:16.630 align:start position:0%
relationship between a parent and a
teacher

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%

01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%

i've been a public high school teacher
 
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:46.789 align:start position:0%
i've been a public high school teacher
for

01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
over 30 years
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm currently teaching in the as an
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
adjunct in the community college system
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
um i did not prepare a statement i
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
apologize for not having a written
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
statement for you
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh as a
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
long-time educator
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
i have and certainly
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
that position has evolved over the
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
decades as i i'm sure that those of you
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
are educators in this room also know
 
01:03:13.119 --> 01:03:13.910 align:start position:0%
are educators in this room also know
that

01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.430 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
i would provide a syllabus at the
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
beginning of the semester
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
that would outline the topics that were
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
going to be covered in the course
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
um and that was something that both and
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
and also a
 
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
general outline of how the grading was
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
going to happen and and other details
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
about the course and that would be
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
signed by the students and by their
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
parents so there was a general
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of that the
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
textbooks were available
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
obviously students had a copy of them
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
and parents were welcome to come look at
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
those as well
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
but specific materials as we've
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
discussed were planned
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes in advance sometimes i use
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
materials that i had used a previous
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
previously other times i was revising
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
them as
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
as we've spoken about other speakers
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
have said
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
you adjust to your students so to be
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
able to make curriculum materials
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
instructional materials on a daily basis
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
available two weeks in advance
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
is a disservice to your students
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
you need to modify as you are teaching
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that i don't think
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
anybody's spoken about and that is that
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
one of the goals of teaching is to make
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
your students be critical thinkers to
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
make them not only master the material
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
but to become independent and critical
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
thinkers and i'm not positive that
 
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.630 align:start position:0%
thinkers and i'm not positive that
the

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.510 align:start position:0%
the
that

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily the intent but the
 
01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.589 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily the intent but the
actual

01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
actual
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
making this bill work
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
of having to have teachers put out all
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
their instructional materials two weeks
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
in advance
 
01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.510 align:start position:0%
in advance
would

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.630 align:start position:0%
would
would

was developed in 2020
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh by the department of education under
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner edelblut
 
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:06.870 align:start position:0%
the commissioner edelblut
um

01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
and at that time
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
i had considerable concerns about
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
student safety consumer protection and
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
information for parents
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
because it was taking the program
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
currently in schools as a work study
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
program or an alternative education
 
01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.669 align:start position:0%
program or an alternative education
program

01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:08:25.679 --> 01:08:26.470 align:start position:0%
program
where

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
many schools had directors
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
had hired people
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
to oversee the program
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
and those people
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
were in contact with local people
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
they um
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
set up
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh went and vetted the
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
the groups that were offering those
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
alternatives um they overs they actually
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
oversaw the the
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
way that the students set up the program
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
with whether it met competencies
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
whether it was worth credit in the
 
01:09:01.839 --> 01:09:03.030 align:start position:0%
whether it was worth credit in the
school

01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
they troublesh
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
they were troubleshooters for anything
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
that happened
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
while the student was in those
 
01:09:08.799 --> 01:09:10.229 align:start position:0%
while the student was in those
alternative

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh situations
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
if there happened to be a problem with
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
the instructor or problem with
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
transportation anything like that and
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
that was my major concern was that um
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
not that
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think alternative
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
situations are not helpful
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
or needed uh for many high school or
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
many middle sc even middle school
 
01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.269 align:start position:0%
many middle sc even middle school
students

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
to go out and see the world to to get
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
outside the
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
the walls of the classroom and
 
01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.709 align:start position:0%
the walls of the classroom and
experience

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
the relevancy of what you're teaching in
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
the classroom
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
and i thought
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
just opening this program
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know to the world
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
uh and allowing parents
 
01:09:53.839 --> 01:09:54.630 align:start position:0%
uh and allowing parents
uh

01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
the ability the the responsibility of
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
taking over
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
all the duties that this person in the
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
school that i was well aware of what
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
they had been doing
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
that now the parents had that
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility totally put on them
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
i was concerned about that and
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
at the time the the program was fairly
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say controversial but it
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
certainly had
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
people had
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
issues with the program but the program
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
passed it passed the school the state
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
school board by a four to three
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
vote and one of the one of the issues
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
that happened was that
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of concern about okay
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
now you're opening it to profit
 
01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.510 align:start position:0%
now you're opening it to profit
nonprofit

01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
educational groups and we know that
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
just looking at colleges how colleges
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
recruit students and
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
and the slick um when money is involved
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden things get a lot slicker
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of advertising and a
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
not so real information um you get to
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
the college and all of a sudden it isn't
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what you thought it was
 
01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.189 align:start position:0%
exactly what you thought it was
um

01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
so i am glad
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
state school boards and the
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
board of education the department of
 
01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.630 align:start position:0%
board of education the department of
education

01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
went about and set up a whole set of
 
01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.229 align:start position:0%
went about and set up a whole set of
rules

01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
and again
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
as i spoke earlier in this committee i
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
really had difficulty finding
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
rules that were applicable to different
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
areas and
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
but once i found the rules i realized
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
that they have quite a
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
set of rules to vet
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
um third party education providers and
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
they have a
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
website on the doe that that actually
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
has good information about the different
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
groups that are offering
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
these educational experiences and um
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
their application processes is pretty
 
01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.750 align:start position:0%
their application processes is pretty
extensive

01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
um my concern was that when i looked at
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
the who actually reviews these
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
that there was a
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
one teacher one teacher currently
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
teaching in the schools on that
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
committee uh and
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
no more than two
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
so i thought that was a little bit
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
could be changed could be looked at
 
01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.790 align:start position:0%
could be changed could be looked at
but

01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
this is in rules and i think we heard
 
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.510 align:start position:0%
this is in rules and i think we heard
from

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton that the rules change
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
and some of them expire some of them are
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
not kept over
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
and so my um one of my atten intents of
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh putting this bill in
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
is to put this in as
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
a statue
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
so so
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
the we have the doe rules um if at any
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
point those rules are changed or
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
at least the basics basics of having a
 
01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.550 align:start position:0%
at least the basics basics of having a
committee

01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
that actually vets these third party um
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
the third party groups will be in law so
 
01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's mainly my
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh intent
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
and i've passed out to the um committee
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
the rules on this from
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
the department of education that i
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
finally got a hold of thank you very
 
01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:12.709 align:start position:0%
finally got a hold of thank you very
much

01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
are there questions for representative
 
01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:18.149 align:start position:0%
are there questions for representative
tanner

01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative luna
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you very much
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative tanner for introducing
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:13:26.719 --> 01:13:28.229 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's hard to figure this out but um and
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a somewhat related
 
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.070 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a somewhat related
question

01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
to rules and and what the department um
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
you know is doing with respect to the
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere program
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
but um it's come to my attention that
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
the the learn everywhere program is a
 
01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.630 align:start position:0%
the the learn everywhere program is a
copyrighted

01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
copyrighted
 
01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.590 align:start position:0%
copyrighted
um

01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
like the learn everywhere term is
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
copyrighted for programs i believe it is
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
um when i when i was on the website and
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
everything i went to the bottom and and
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm pretty sure that it was
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
copyrighted there's a copyright thing
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
after it okay and uh follow-up mr chair
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
and so this is sort of a would you
 
01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.149 align:start position:0%
and so this is sort of a would you
believe

01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh type of thing but would you believe
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
that if a term is copyrighted that in
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
order to preserve the copyright
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
um or to certainly
 
01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh preserve a license associated with a
 
01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.750 align:start position:0%
uh preserve a license associated with a
copyright

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
copyright
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
that in the first use the first
 
01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.910 align:start position:0%
that in the first use the first
um

01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
yeah use of that term on a web page or
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
in a booklet or in a manual or something
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
like that has to actually include the
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
copyright um notice
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
i was just surprised that it that it was
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
copyrighted it was something that i i
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
noticed so okay great thank you very
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
much further questions for
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
nazi yes representative cordelli
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%

01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um thank you
 
01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.669 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um thank you
representative

01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:01.679 --> 01:15:03.350 align:start position:0%
representative
um

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
am i correct in that the one change here
 
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.390 align:start position:0%
am i correct in that the one change here
um

01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
is that the um
 
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.630 align:start position:0%
is that the um
credits

01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
credits
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
must be accepted by the local school
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
or maybe
 
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe right but they
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
um so basically
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
the role of the state board in this
 
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
whole process
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
is uh changing
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.990 align:start position:0%
in that
um

01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
there has to be a local approval process
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
as well for any uh credits to be granted
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
the bill that we talked about before
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
that i believe you introduced where uh
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
it was mandatory
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
that the school ex accept uh the credits
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
is is
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
being put before us
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
to actually change the change the law
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
i think the law originally was
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
that they may be accepted and they could
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
be up to one third of the credits for
 
01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:11.110 align:start position:0%
be up to one third of the credits for
graduation

01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
any follow-up are you good
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
further questions represent porter
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
representative tina so my understanding
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
is this the state board of education
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
does have rules of how these
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
organizations are vetted and you want to
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that that gets
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
put into statute so those rules
 
01:16:31.679 --> 01:16:32.830 align:start position:0%
put into statute so those rules
continue

01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
continue are you at all concerned with
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill that
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
that those rules could change anyway
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
because it says
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
um shall adopt rules that establish a
 
01:16:45.199 --> 01:16:46.550 align:start position:0%
um shall adopt rules that establish a
process

01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
so that the rules are already there
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
this goes in
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
can the department then go in and change
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
their rules that so still there's an
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
application process in vetting but
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
they're different than
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
what you see here what we see i think
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i mean i think
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
i think one of one of my intents was
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
also to bring this up for discussion and
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
the fact that um
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of the issues in the in the rules
 
01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.390 align:start position:0%
a lot of the issues in the in the rules
section

01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know um perhaps like the the um
 
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
panel that reviews the third party uh
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps that's something in
 
01:17:25.199 --> 01:17:26.070 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps that's something in
future

01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
once this is in law can be amended and
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
or put into statute
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh i have a question for you uh
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
you you have in their approval of
 
01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.350 align:start position:0%
you you have in their approval of
vendors

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
are we talking uh uh various businesses
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
which may have an individual on the
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
floor for example like new england wire
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
and a work based program
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
are we talking about uh
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
other public schools or career technical
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
education centers or other nonprofits
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
exactly what is the definition of vendor
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
here well i think it's a third party
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh group that that's offering uh
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
educational services um
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
and so you know certainly the career and
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
technical uh education that is part of
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
our public school system that um you
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
know i think that that certainly is
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
is not a third party vendor
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
but uh prenda would be a third-party
 
01:18:21.199 --> 01:18:23.270 align:start position:0%
but uh prenda would be a third-party
vendor

01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
vendor
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
so in follow-up uh when a career tax
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
center has a student
 
01:18:28.159 --> 01:18:29.270 align:start position:0%
center has a student
gaining

01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
gaining
 
01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.870 align:start position:0%
gaining
competencies

01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
competencies
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
through the work based program they have
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
established which might be nafa auto
 
01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.510 align:start position:0%
established which might be nafa auto
care

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
is naf auto care now a vendor or or how
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
does that work well i think they're
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's something that the committee
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's studying uh career and technical
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
education and credits that would be
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
something that they would then approve
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's something that has legislative
 
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.910 align:start position:0%
it's something that has legislative
oversight

01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
versus something that is uh
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
putting in an application to the learn
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
everywhere program
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh as a third party vendor
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
 
01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.590 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
representative

01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
welcome back sarah
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
all right good to see you guys all again
 
01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.390 align:start position:0%
all right good to see you guys all again
today

01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman and members of
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
the committee for the opportunity to
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
testify here today my name is sarah
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
scott and i'm the director of grassroots
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
operations with americans for prosperity
 
01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
and on behalf of afp new hampshire and
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
our activists all across the state
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
i urge you to oppose house bill 1051
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
which would change the rule making
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
authority for the state board of
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
education to implement the learn
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
everywhere program
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
as we talked about yesterday since
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
launching at the end of 2020
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
over 10 providers have been approved and
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
the majority of those were in the last
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
six months which has given thousands of
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire students access to high
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
school credit for the learning that
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
they're already participating in
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
so this legislation would drastically
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
change the learn everywhere program by
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
requiring providers to be approved at a
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
local level as well
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
this creates a substantial barrier to
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
providers in the program and i think
 
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
would discourage many if not all from
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
applying to the program
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
the current role established a process
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
by which the
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
provider may apply to be a learn
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
everywhere provider and these
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
applications go through a rigorous
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
approval process by the department of
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
education it's reviewed by certified
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
teachers and then the state board of
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
education and by changing this to a
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
district level we're then asking
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
providers to go through an application
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
process at the state level and then move
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
down to the local level to make sure
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
that their students would get credit for
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
these classes
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
the application process is very time
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
consuming and it has been worthwhile for
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
these providers because it's something
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
that once they get through the process
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
their students are immediately able to
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
get credit from their local schools
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation would really create a
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
level of inequality among districts and
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
we would be left in a situation where
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
similar to the extended learning
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities not every district is able
 
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
the current process is really the
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
ultimate level of local control because
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
we're giving parents the option to
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
choose which classes their children
 
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.750 align:start position:0%
choose which classes their children
attend

01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
attend
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
so it's really for these reasons that we
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
ask that you recommend this legislation
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
as an expedient to legislate and
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
continue to allow these high school
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
students to get credit for the learning
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's taking place
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative cornell
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
question and appearing here again today
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing in the the bill where it
 
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0%
says the local district in addition to
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
the state board has to approve the um
 
01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.790 align:start position:0%
the state board has to approve the um
the

01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
the program i i do see that it says it
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
may be accepted and i think we discussed
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
that if it doesn't meet you know the
 
01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.669 align:start position:0%
that if it doesn't meet you know the
competencies

01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
competencies
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
so could you tell me what line says the
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
school district has to in addition to
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
the state board approve sure thank you
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
for the question representative um so
 
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a situation now in
 
01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.110 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a situation now in
which

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
these providers would then have to go to
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
the local school to explain the program
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
and explain how their course meets the
 
01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.750 align:start position:0%
and explain how their course meets the
competencies

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
competencies
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
and they would be dragged into a further
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
process of explaining their program a
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
lot of organizations when they
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
first heard about learn everywhere
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
were interested in becoming approved
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that they could offer
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
this program to all of their students
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
first robotics is one example of that
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
right now they're not operating in every
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
school district and this was an
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity because they wanted to
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
provide this education for all of the
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire students and so by going
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
district by district to explain
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
the same thing that was just approved by
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
the state board of education is
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
something that they don't have the
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
bandwidth to do
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i'm really
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
confused about this
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
this line i'm reading directly from the
 
01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.110 align:start position:0%
this line i'm reading directly from the
bill

01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.310 align:start position:0%
bill
line

01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.270 align:start position:0%
line
seven

01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
nothing in this sub-paragraph
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
shall prevent a local school district
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
from approving vendors offering credit
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
for alternative extended learning or
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
work based programs which do not appear
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
on the pre-approved list
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
maintained by the school board
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
so it's not saying in my way of reading
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
this that the local just the the learn
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere vendors need to come to the
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
local schools to get approval what it is
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
saying is the school board itself can
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
also approve other learn everywhere type
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
programs that are not on the school on
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
the learn any career program provided by
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm not seeing how you can say
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
that this would force your learn
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
everywhere people to come to every local
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
school board
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
so um based on that i actually have no
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
disagreement with that part i think that
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
local school districts should absolutely
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
be able to approve things in addition to
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
the approved list by the state board i'm
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
looking at the line before that that
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
says that the credit may be accepted
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
currently the credit is accepted so this
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
would make a change to say that it only
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
may be accepted which means that if a
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
district has questions about a program
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
and says no the provider
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
would then have to go into the school
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
and explain what their program is that
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
they just went through at the state
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
level process thank you thank you i have
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
a question um and a little follow-up to
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
where we were yesterday with hb 1329
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
and i communicated so this will be a
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
question it was communicated to me that
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
schools specifically i have had it
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
directed to me
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
that a school will not accept credit
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
from an alternative
 
01:25:02.159 --> 01:25:03.430 align:start position:0%
from an alternative
program

01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that we teach that in
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
our school and this is sacred turf for
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
our school we will award the credit for
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
this particular course and subject
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
have have you been aware of that
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
occurring in the state or elsewhere and
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
in in case how then would we get
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
help for the student who is off cycle
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
and scheduled in the high school and the
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
course they're offering isn't being
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
offered when they need it and they can
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
go and get it over here
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
and graduate in a timely manner with of
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
the rest of the class
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so um in
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
terms of schools not approving credit i
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
haven't heard of any district that has
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
not accepted a learn everywhere credit
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
until like up until now i have not heard
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
of that but i know that this was an
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
issue that
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
was fixed last year by this legislature
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that credits from all new
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire public high schools were
 
01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.390 align:start position:0%
hampshire public high schools were
approved

01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
approved
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
so far we have not had any issues with
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere credits being approved
 
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
based on the process that they go
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
through at the state level it's very
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
clear what the competencies are and what
 
01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.750 align:start position:0%
clear what the competencies are and what
courses

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
courses
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
they meet based on that i know there's a
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
speaker after me who can speak uh more
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
to that in a greater level of detail
 
01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.830 align:start position:0%
to that in a greater level of detail

little bit of background on
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
um learn everywhere and how it works but
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
first say that i'm i'm strongly opposed
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
to this bill it would destroy the
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
learner everywhere program
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
um the way the learn everywhere program
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
programs apply
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
so if somebody
 
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.629 align:start position:0%
so if somebody
private

01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
private program non-profit or profit
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
wants to become part of learn everywhere
 
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
program they submit an application to
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
the department then has staff that
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
review that application very thoroughly
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
they go back and forth they create a
 
01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.550 align:start position:0%
they go back and forth they create a
team

01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
team
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
that evaluates the application once it
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
is vetted by the department of education
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
um and they have to go through a
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
checklist to make sure it meet it aligns
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
with state standards that it meets state
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
competencies that everybody who has
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
contact with not just instructors
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
everybody in the program who has contact
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
with a student has to pass a criminal
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
background check there's a long list of
 
01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
hurdles they have to to get over
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
then it comes before the state board of
 
01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:11.590 align:start position:0%
then it comes before the state board of
education

01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
the state board of education then also
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
reviews it
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
and we approve it or not
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
um we have had a few applications that
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
we did not approve we sent back because
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
they we had questions about how they
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
worked their details weren't very clear
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
and then we had a uh
 
01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
we had them come back they were
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
im improved and we approved them
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
once a learn everywhere program is
 
01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
approved by the state board we have 11
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
right now that are approved
 
01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.990 align:start position:0%
right now that are approved
um

01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
a student can enroll in that program
 
01:28:44.159 --> 01:28:46.390 align:start position:0%
a student can enroll in that program
receive

01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
receive
 
01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.270 align:start position:0%
receive
um

01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
credits to get a credit
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
they have to demonstrate that they've
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
met the competencies
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
i think this is really important for
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
everybody to understand
 
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
um this is not just well you can go play
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
sports on some team and um you know
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
whatever you choose and you can you know
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
come in and get a pe credit for it they
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
have to demonstrate that they've met the
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
competencies and that
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
and that requires evaluation so every
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
program that is approved
 
01:29:17.110 --> 01:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
has to demonstrate to the department and
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
to the board that they have an
 
01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:20.719 align:start position:0%
evaluation system process we see which
 
01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
competencies the kid meets
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
and we see the credits and how that
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
aligns uh with the credits that are
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
required and with the state standards it
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
has to be line of state standards
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
once it's approved
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
then a parent can enroll a child in that
 
01:29:34.639 --> 01:29:35.590 align:start position:0%
then a parent can enroll a child in that
program

01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
once the child completes the learn
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
everywhere program
 
01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:39.990 align:start position:0%
everywhere program
they

01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
are awarded a basically a certificate of
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
completion that they've earned the
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
credit then they take that back to their
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
school district and the district has to
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
accept it
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
now i want to explain why we did it that
 
01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.709 align:start position:0%
now i want to explain why we did it that
way

01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
first that's consistent with new
 
01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire's competency-based system so
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
all of you should know
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
in 2005 the state board of education and
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
the department of education created new
 
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire's state competency-based
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
instruction system
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
so and that was
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
something that began in the 1990s we had
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
a pilot program with 27 districts from
 
01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
98 to
 
01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.550 align:start position:0%
98 to
2004

01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
2004
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
to test competency-based education new
 
01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.910 align:start position:0%
to test competency-based education new
hampshire

01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
and in 2005 we adopted rules
 
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
that switched new hampshire
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
every school district in new hampshire
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
is is competency-based the rules are
 
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.229 align:start position:0%
is is competency-based the rules are
competency-based

01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
competency-based
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
that means that students
 
01:30:36.239 --> 01:30:37.430 align:start position:0%
that means that students
get

01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:38.470 align:start position:0%
get
credit

01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
credit
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
for high school
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
credit their graduation credits
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
based on demonstration that they've
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
mastered competencies
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
in the rule by rule that was passed in
 
01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.229 align:start position:0%
in the rule by rule that was passed in
2005

01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
2005
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
students do not have to spend a minute
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
in class to get a course credit or to
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the competencies i will read
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.790 align:start position:0%
 
rule 306.27

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
rule 306.27
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
credits shall be based on demonstration
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
of district and or graduation
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
competencies not on the time spent
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
achieving those competencies
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
the credit shall equate to the level of
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
rigor of academic necessity and so forth
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
students may receive acknowledgement
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
this is i
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
of achievement for graduation
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
competencies through student
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
demonstration of a collection of work
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
other than a assessment evidence gained
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
through pri i'm sorry or
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
other assessment of evidence gained
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
through prior learning activities
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
that's pre-existing rule we didn't write
 
01:31:32.639 --> 01:31:33.430 align:start position:0%
that's pre-existing rule we didn't write
that

01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's that predated learn everywhere
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere was designed to be
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
consistent with that
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
so the way the program works is the
 
01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:43.669 align:start position:0%
so the way the program works is the
students

01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
demonstrate they've met the competencies
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
that leads to the credit
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then they take that back to the
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
school district that is perfectly
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
consistent with the way new hampshire
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
has operated since 2005.
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to make that very clear
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
now when we started the public hearings
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
and the rulemaking process on there and
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
everywhere we had a vigorous debate at
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
the board of education and and there was
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
disagreement over whether we should
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
require write the rules so that the
 
01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.950 align:start position:0%
require write the rules so that the
student

01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
could take the credit back and the
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
district would have to recognize the
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
credit and award credit for that or
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
whether the district may
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
recognize it and award credit
 
01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:23.590 align:start position:0%
recognize it and award credit
and

01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
when we started to hear from the
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
programs that would potentially
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to apply
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
they told us in the public hearing in no
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
uncertain terms many of them did
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
that if we wrote the rules so that the
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
districts had an option of denying the
 
01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.550 align:start position:0%
districts had an option of denying the
credit

01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
credit
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
they would not create a learn everywhere
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
program and first robotics did a really
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
good job of explaining how this would
 
01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:46.550 align:start position:0%
good job of explaining how this would
work

01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
in their testimony
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
they explained that they're already in
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
schools in new hampshire
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
and their experience i mean they're all
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
over the world
 
01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.669 align:start position:0%
over the world
um

01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
and i think this testifies to the need
 
01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
for lean everywhere first robotics has
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
been in
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire schools for years
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
and none of the kids was able to get a
 
01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.350 align:start position:0%
and none of the kids was able to get a
credit

01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
credit
 
01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:06.629 align:start position:0%
credit
for

01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
science math or business by doing the
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
first robotics program only through loon
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere can a student now get a
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
credit for participation in that program
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
and it is very rigorous
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
um they explained to us we would not
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
do a program we wouldn't go to the
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
effort of creating
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
cte programs because those would change
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
district to district we can't scale that
 
01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.669 align:start position:0%
district to district we can't scale that
statewide

01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
with learn everywhere we can create one
 
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.590 align:start position:0%
with learn everywhere we can create one
program

01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
and scale it statewide and it's equal
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
so every kid whether you're in lebanon
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
or bedford or claremont or charlestown
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
if you have a
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
first robotics program you get the same
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
program you get the same credit so it
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
equalizes it out but it also makes it
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
um easier on
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
on them because if we didn't have that
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
they would have to go to each individual
 
01:33:58.719 --> 01:33:59.990 align:start position:0%
they would have to go to each individual
district

01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
and tailor the program to that
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
district's needs that's not workable for
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
a group like first robotics so that's
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
why we did it this way it creates equity
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
it creates a level playing field every
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
child in the state has access to the
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
same or everywhere programs and
 
01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:16.790 align:start position:0%
same or everywhere programs and
um

01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
from an investment of the of the
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
family's time
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
and money and resources and energy it
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
also makes it worthwhile so this way we
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
prevented and we heard this concern too
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
that we prevented a situation where a
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
parent would enroll in a learn
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere program
 
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
find out that their district had a
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
problem with it and wouldn't accept the
 
01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:39.430 align:start position:0%
problem with it and wouldn't accept the
credit

01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
credit
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
so this guarantees that kids will get
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
the credits if they go through the
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
program and it is very thoroughly vetted
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
and i can i can share with you if you'd
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
like i don't want to take up too much
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
time the examples of some of the
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
programs that we have um authorized
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
they're fabulous programs um
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh there's a list on the state website
 
01:34:56.639 --> 01:34:57.510 align:start position:0%
uh there's a list on the state website
that

01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know outlines them all but
 
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:01.990 align:start position:0%
you know outlines them all but
uh

01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
so i just i want to highlight just a
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
couple real quick um new hampshire
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
academy of science and lyme
 
01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:08.149 align:start position:0%
academy of science and lyme
so

01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
prior to lint everywhere kids were going
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
to the hampshire academy of science and
 
01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:12.790 align:start position:0%
to the hampshire academy of science and
lime

01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
lime
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
where science is taught by dartmouth
 
01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:15.830 align:start position:0%
where science is taught by dartmouth
professors

01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
professors
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
and it is rigorous lab based science
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
program and they were not allowed to get
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
academic credit for that they had to go
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
back to school in their high school
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
wherever it was and take that same
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
science class over again
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
now they get credit for that
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
seacoast science center we approved so i
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of you familiar with
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
this fabulous program they have a marine
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
biology program kids can get credit for
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
now it's fantastic
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
first robotics the boys and girls club
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
of souhegan valley
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
has a theater program
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
they created a learn everywhere theater
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
program so you can now get academic
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
credit for participating in their
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
theater but it is not just for showing
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
up and acting in a play
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
they had to create a structure that
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
showed that the kids got competencies
 
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
there they have
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
instructors there are volunteers but
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
instructors with bachelor's degrees in
 
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
arts and one who's got a master's in
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
education so it's a it's a rigorous
 
01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:13.910 align:start position:0%
education so it's a it's a rigorous
program

01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
um seacoast united
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh the soccer and i think the baseball
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
two um program they have a very rigorous
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
program to get pe credits and i was very
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
skeptical of the pe stuff i have to say
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
right off the bat because my thinking
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
was right how are you going to
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that you've got to
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
competencies but they gave us a very
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
thorough rigorous proposal that outlined
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
how the kids are going to be evaluated
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
they demonstrate progress on their
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
health and their capabilities
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
and whether they gain skills and they
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
have a wellness component of the program
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's very good program and we vetted it
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
very fairly and so those are the kinds
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
of examples of programs that you can do
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
through and everywhere and get credits
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
statewide and we've approved some some
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
online programs cooman academy for
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
example has a very rigorous math program
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
now the benefit of this statewide is
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
that you can take this online so no
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
matter where you are in new hampshire
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
you can get access to kumon academy and
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
you can take algebra and trigonometry
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
and get credit for that so that's how it
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
works and if there are any and the
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
reason why this bill would destroy the
 
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
program is because it would give
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
districts ability to
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
to not accept that credit and um and
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
that was just not workable
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman uh
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
represent luna
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
very much chairman klein for joining us
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.430 align:start position:0%
this morning
um

01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
just a
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
couple of um a couple of questions
 
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
tied in with your um with your testimony
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
but you'd mentioned the
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
competencies and alignment with state
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
standards i was wondering on the um in
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh where where the improved programs are
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
listed does it also include the uh the
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
competencies and alignment so that um
 
01:37:57.119 --> 01:37:58.229 align:start position:0%
competencies and alignment so that um
um

01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
out of transparency so that parents and
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
teachers and students
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh can understand um to what level of
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
rigor these were approved by the state
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
board so on on the website are you
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
asking is it is that on the website just
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
just anywhere available um i'm not sure
 
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.070 align:start position:0%
just anywhere available um i'm not sure
how

01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
we lost at the department a
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
communications person a while back and
 
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
then we so our website is a little
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
lagging but it is in the packet and in
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
the program approval itself um if it's
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
not posted online i agree with you we
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
should we should post it online i'm not
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
sure i mean i can click through but i
 
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
want to spend time doing that right um
 
01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:32.390 align:start position:0%
want to spend time doing that right um
but

01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.629 align:start position:0%
but
uh

01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:34.639 --> 01:38:36.950 align:start position:0%
uh
it

01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
so when you when you enroll in this
 
01:38:38.639 --> 01:38:41.030 align:start position:0%
so when you when you enroll in this
program

01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
you should get
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
um you know a
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
a sort of layout of how it works right
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
if you're a student you're enrolling so
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
you will see
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
how it progresses what the assessments
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
are and that kind of thing but um i'm
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
not sure if the parents can actually see
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know like so when you when you take
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
a course in a regular public school you
 
01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:01.109 align:start position:0%
a course in a regular public school you
don't

01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
see okay we got the quiz here the quiz
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
aligns with this competency that's not
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
how it's you actually
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
you do get that in the course but the
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
parent what i'm saying is the parent
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily see that
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
um when they have the the syllabus so um
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to to make sure that that is
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
included if it's not okay okay thank you
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and just one follow-up on that mr
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
chair sure um and and thanks for that
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
thanks for that that information should
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
be available certainly from a
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
transparency standpoint but do i don't
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm like i said i'm on uh i think
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
the same page that you're on now with
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
approved um courses
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
do any of these um
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere um
 
01:39:43.679 --> 01:39:44.870 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere um
um

01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities come at a cost to the
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
student yeah some of them have a have a
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
tuition cost okay and a final follow-up
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
but we have asked and just to clear to
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
to clarify some of them do have a cost
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
we um
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
ask every program when they apply if
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
they have um
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
any sort of scale or reduced costs and
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
all of them that we've approved
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
have uh reduced cost for for kids who um
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
you know have struggled for that some of
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
them offer it free some of them offered
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
a reduced cost
 
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and follow up on that i
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
promise this is my last but but based on
 
01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:23.270 align:start position:0%
promise this is my last but but based on
that

01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
um and based on the londonderry decision
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
how is a cost to a student for a
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
so the learn everywhere program
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
was created to make sure that students
 
01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:41.679 align:start position:0%
can get credit
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
for stuff they're doing and learning
 
01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
outside of the classroom so
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
again because we have a competency-based
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
system right
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
as i read in the rules from
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
you know 8327
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
all a student has to do to get a credit
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
is demonstrate that they've mastered the
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
competency so they don't have to enroll
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
in any program they can take a test and
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they've mastered a
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
competency so this program
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
allows them
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that they've mastered
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
gives them a certificate at the end of
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
the program to allow them to do that
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't exclude
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
doing that in other ways right outside
 
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
of this program so in other words i
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a constitutional
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
issue here
 
01:41:30.159 --> 01:41:31.350 align:start position:0%
issue here
because

01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
it is simply a means of allowing them to
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they earn the
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
competency okay thank you sure thank you
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
i do have one question for you and then
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
i'll get representative porter um
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
knowing that the concept of our the uh
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
principle of competencies was put in
 
01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
effect back in virginia barry's days as
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner correct prior to 2005 and
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
it was a move forward to get away from
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
seat time
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh required seat time before you go on
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
to the fourth grade and sixth grade et
 
01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
cetera right um so when we're looking at
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
the competencies which we're offering
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
for the the high school level for a
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
course let's say in chemistry
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
and and hypothetically there may be five
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
or seven competencies built in for that
 
01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
course or program
 
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
when we're at the learn everywhere
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
program and a student has mastered like
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
four out of seven
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
competencies do they get partial credit
 
01:42:24.239 --> 01:42:25.030 align:start position:0%
competencies do they get partial credit
or

01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
how does that work
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
no to my understanding the way we
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
when you
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
competencies and credits are different
 
01:42:41.119 --> 01:42:42.550 align:start position:0%
competencies and credits are different
so

01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
the learner program is designed to get
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
you a credit
 
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
at the end that you can then get you
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
know get counted towards your graduation
 
01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:51.030 align:start position:0%
know get counted towards your graduation
credits

01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
credits
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
if you have demonstrated
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
competencies that maybe four of the
 
01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
seven as you said you won't get the
 
01:42:56.719 --> 01:42:57.990 align:start position:0%
seven as you said you won't get the
credit

01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
credit
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
so i don't know i mean i suppose a
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
student could go to
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
their school and say look i've
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
i've learned i've earned the
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
competencies i think the school could
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
could probably say well you know
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's not a credit
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
you'll have to pass our test to show
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
that you actually know the company says
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
i think that probably would be how it
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
worked um
 
01:43:19.590 --> 01:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know but i don't
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know of an instance of that
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
right now but the way this program's
 
01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
structured you have to get it's the
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
credit at the end
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
that you take back and get full credit
 
01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:29.189 align:start position:0%
that you take back and get full credit
for

01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
and for that and that competencies might
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
be spread over and the student may have
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
missed the first three or four
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
took that through learn everywhere
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
program right and then could pick up the
 
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
other uh in the second semester that was
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
just the
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
question and a concern i think it can be
 
01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:54.639 align:start position:0%
found yeah i mean i think that's
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
something the parent can and the family
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
can work out with the school we've we've
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
earned these competencies we can
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that the student has earned
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
the competencies and we can count that i
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
mean i think that would be appropriate
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
porter thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
mr klein for for indulging me here a
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
little bit sure um
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
one denigration of our local public
 
01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
schools that we've been hearing a lot is
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
to call them government schools
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
so our schools are no longer being
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
referred to as the public schools but
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
by

01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:31.830 align:start position:0%
by
bypassing

01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
bypassing
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
local school boards
 
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
in this process
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
my fear is that you're propagating that
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
image of government schools because we
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
have the state approving what you need
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
what you can use for graduation and i i
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
i applaud the um competency-based
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
education i think sounds like the
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
programs that you're using are wonderful
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
my concern is that somewhere along the
 
01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:03.990 align:start position:0%
my concern is that somewhere along the
line

01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
the local schools and the local
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
communities have been left out of this
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere process
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that they no longer
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
feel that the schools are theirs
 
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
and that the the
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
insult of calling them government
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
schools becomes more real and i'm
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can address my concern
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
on this because i'm i'm deeply
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
passionate about our local public
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
schools and i'm deeply hoping that our
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
local control can make be maintained
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
through these stressful times that we're
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
experiencing now with funding and those
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
sorts of things um sure thank you for
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
the question um i i don't believe i've
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
referred to the schools that way and
 
01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
um and i just want to know we have heard
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
i have heard it several times in this
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
room okay um
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
that's just not i think conceptually i'm
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
not sure i would fall in that category
 
01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.430 align:start position:0%
not sure i would fall in that category
um

01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
i i guess i'll back up a little bit um
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
again to go back to the competency-based
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
system we have we already have rules and
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
these were nonpartisan
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
non-controversial i mean you know maggie
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
hassan when she was governor was a very
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
big proponent of competency-based
 
01:46:16.159 --> 01:46:17.430 align:start position:0%
big proponent of competency-based
education

01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
um i i don't
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
i just don't think there's a partisan
 
01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
divide here i think everybody's pretty
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
much on board and so those rules uh
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
learn everything is perfectly consistent
 
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:28.950 align:start position:0%
learn everything is perfectly consistent
with

01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
the way we do competencies in new
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire and that is
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
um and i think there's some
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding i mean i know i've had
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
conversations with folks outside of the
 
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
system who don't quite understand
 
01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:39.990 align:start position:0%
system who don't quite understand
um

01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
the credits and competencies are
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
structured first
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
and then the curriculum is written to
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
meet those so it's not the other way
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
around so i think that's just
 
01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:50.390 align:start position:0%
around so i think that's just
conceptually

01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
conceptually
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
what some people don't understand so
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
when we were doing learn everywhere we
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
were told well this is you know you're
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
bypassing the curriculum but that's
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
not the way the system works the system
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
works so that the student
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrates competency
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
the curriculum is written to get the
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
student to the competency but our system
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
is structured before learn everywhere in
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
such a way that a student could come in
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
and demonstrate that they know the stuff
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
and not have to sit in the class and go
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
through the curriculum i mean that's
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
just the way the system works
 
01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:23.830 align:start position:0%
just the way the system works
so

01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
and so i think thinking of it in in
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
conceptually that learn everywhere
 
01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:29.430 align:start position:0%
conceptually that learn everywhere
is

01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
taking away local control or bypassing
 
01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
that control over curriculum is not the
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
right way to think of it because again
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere is consistent with the
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
competency-based system where we're just
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
saying students
 
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
can demonstrate that they have a
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
competency and they get credit for that
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
yes but
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay so yes please so i i'm a kid and i
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
go and i have a competency in the
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
russian language and i go in and i meet
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
the competencies
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
for for
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that i have enough
 
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
competency to whatever
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
i go to my local school board
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
to get that credit
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's how that works outside of this
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
program somebody has to approve that and
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
say yes indeed this child has met these
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
competencies and my understanding has
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
been that in the past
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's the role and the function of the
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
local school board and
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm just so conflicted because now
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
they're not in it anymore anything that
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
you say is okay has to be okay and
 
01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:40.070 align:start position:0%
you say is okay has to be okay and
anything

01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:41.270 align:start position:0%
anything
but

01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
it just feels like they should be in
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
there somewhere so that the local
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
control can be maintained at least
 
01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:50.229 align:start position:0%
control can be maintained at least
superficially

01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
superficially
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
well i i guess i would again just
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
address it um
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
the the rules the 300s i mean the way
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
the rules are written
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
for public school districts are i mean
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
every almost everyone starts with shall
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
superintendents shall the school board
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
shall district shall the teachers i mean
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's all shall shall shall
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
just conceptually again
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
that's the way our system has been
 
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
forever and the company the cte programs
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
that were created
 
01:49:25.119 --> 01:49:26.070 align:start position:0%
that were created
um

01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
read through the rules on those it's all
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
the district shall the school shall
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
um you know there was resistance in the
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
beginning from some districts to do the
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
cte programs so the cte rules are full
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
of districts shall do this they shall
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
make these available they shall do so
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
so the idea that
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
the districts have total
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
control outside of the state for
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
deciding these things is just not
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
accurate the state sets the rules and
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
guides what the districts can do and
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
can't do
 
01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:58.310 align:start position:0%
can't do
and

01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
and how competencies are to be met and
 
01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's just the way the system has
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
worked for a very long time and so learn
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere is just a way to say
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
we're recognizing that students are
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
learning and earning
 
01:50:11.589 --> 01:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
competencies outside of
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
the school itself in this other way so
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to create a program that can
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
scale statewide
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
and allow kids the opportunity to
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they've done that so
 
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
again i just i don't think it's really
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
that inconsistent with the way we've
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
done things before
 
01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:31.430 align:start position:0%
done things before
sure

01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
very quick i think
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
i think going back one question you did
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
say that if all the competencies weren't
 
01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:46.639 align:start position:0%
met like if they only met
 
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
three out of the seven the school
 
01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
district does not have to accept that as
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
a credit yeah because they didn't me
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
they didn't get the credit so the school
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
district can't say no
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
not if they get the credit
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
but if they don't meet the if they don't
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
meet the competencies the school
 
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
district can say no you did not meet the
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
competencies for this credit so i'm a
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
little the way with the rules was all
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
geared towards um the credit
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
right so the kid so the rules are if
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
they can if they earn the credit
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
then the school has to accept the credit
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
now we have pre-existing rules that
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
govern demonstration of competencies
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
and so and again i'm
 
01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
i wasn't prepared and think of it that
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
way so i don't want to give you a
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
definitive answer but my guess is that
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
if you've met some of the competencies
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
but haven't earned the credit
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
then you would have to show the school
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
district that you've met those
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
competencies and that would be something
 
01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
you'd work out with the district i think
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
i that's just the way i kind of
 
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
understand it because the way the rules
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
are written they're all geared towards
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
the credit
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
but i could go back and check
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
and have somebody get back to you if
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and welcome to house
 
01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:58.149 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and welcome to house
education

01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
my question give me credit for the
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:07.830 align:start position:0%
question um
so

01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.350 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
chairman klein is there any provision
 
01:52:15.589 --> 01:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
for instructor evaluation in the learn
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
i'd have to go back for the rules and
 
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
see how we how we wrote that um the
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
instructors are not required to be
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
certified teachers obviously
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
they are required to pass criminal
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
and the way we've worked it
 
01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:38.550 align:start position:0%
and the way we've worked it
with

01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
with these applicants is that
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
we do ask them
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
we want to see who their instructors are
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know what their qualifications are
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
so we get that i'm not sure
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
off top my head how the rules address it
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
can i just have one quick follow-up mr
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
so with regards to um
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
instructional materials yeah
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
they give that to us are there rules or
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
is there a process by which you're
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
looking at instructional materials and
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
does it come within two weeks of
 
01:53:11.679 --> 01:53:13.060 align:start position:0%
does it come within two weeks of
instruction

01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:13.070 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:16.149 align:start position:0%
instruction
[Laughter]

01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:53:16.159 --> 01:53:19.030 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
actually

01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's fun about doing
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
these roles at the state board and
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
having the flexibility to write the
 
01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
rules ourselves and making sure that
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's not all written in law is that we
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility to adjust and so
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things we learned from our
 
01:53:35.589 --> 01:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
application process last year was that
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
we needed to tighten up the rule around
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
materials so we actually um in november
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
i think it was we proposed changes to
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
the river rules that would clarify
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
um that they have to give us their
 
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
instructional materials and curriculum
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
we have to see that we were getting it
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
beforehand but it wasn't written in the
 
01:53:54.070 --> 01:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
rule and we just wanted to clarify that
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
i was in a rule so we are getting that
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
um and it is going to be going forward
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
part of the rule that's finalized and
 
01:54:00.239 --> 01:54:01.350 align:start position:0%
part of the rule that's finalized and
then

01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:03.910 align:start position:0%
then
um

01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think the rule spells out
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
specifically that
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
they have to show that to the parent
 
01:54:10.870 --> 01:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
because they give it to us and we
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
approve it but i don't see any objection
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
to making sure the parents see all the
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
materials ahead of time
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you sure
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
very quick thank you very much mr chair
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking my question
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
mr chair um do um do non-public schools
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
under contract with a school district
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.199 --> 01:54:36.629 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:54:36.629 --> 01:54:36.639 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
under contract with the school district
 
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about pinkerton
 
01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:41.510 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about pinkerton
academy

01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
academy
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
pinkerton would be an example but but
 
01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there are are others under
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
contract with public schools um i'd have
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
to go back and clarify i believe that
 
01:54:53.589 --> 01:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
would be correct if you are um
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
a public academy
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
i assume you're included but i i'd have
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
to go back and check follow up just to
 
01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:01.189 align:start position:0%
to go back and check follow up just to
clarify

01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
i'm really not limiting it to public
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
academy i'm limiting it to non-public
 
01:55:05.599 --> 01:55:06.629 align:start position:0%
academy i'm limiting it to non-public
schools

01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
which which i believe encompass
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
everything except
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
01:55:14.070 --> 01:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay so all non-public schools whether
 
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
that be anything that's not a school
 
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
district not a public no no we're not
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
regulating non-public schools on this
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
this is for public schools so so if you
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
have if you had a contract in the
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
republic academy and you were
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
functioning as a public school i think
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
you'd be covered but if you're just in a
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
non-private school we don't make no no
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
i'm saying a non-public school under
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
contract with a with a school district
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
um if you could if you could follow up
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
on yeah i can i can find that out for
 
01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
you i gotta
 
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
i can definitely get it
 
01:55:46.229 --> 01:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
on maybe a lot of other questions
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
sure happy to get that thank you very
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
much okay uh are there any further
 
01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:51.589 align:start position:0%
much okay uh are there any further
questions

01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%

01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with a different
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
subset of students than we've been
 
01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
talking about so far this morning
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
there are increasing numbers of students
 
01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
who come from cultures countries where
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
they speak languages we don't typically
 
01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:19.669 align:start position:0%
they speak languages we don't typically
teach

01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
teach
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
hindi urdu things like that
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
we focus usually in the schools on
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
european languages
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
so french spanish german that sort of
 
01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:30.550 align:start position:0%
so french spanish german that sort of
thing

01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if this process would
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
allow someone who
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
had a very high level of competency
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
which can be ascertained there are
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
companies that do that and the colleges
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
and universities use them and wanted to
 
01:56:44.639 --> 01:56:45.830 align:start position:0%
and universities use them and wanted to
assert

01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
assert
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
that he had fulfilled a foreign language
 
01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:49.430 align:start position:0%
that he had fulfilled a foreign language
con

01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
con
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
competency which the school system does
 
01:56:53.669 --> 01:56:53.679 align:start position:0%
not offer
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
in that language would he nonetheless be
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
able to do that he or she well uh right
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
now we have no foreign language programs
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
approved through learn everywhere so um
 
01:57:06.149 --> 01:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
in that program itself no but we do have
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
an applicant that has come in for
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
spanish so hopefully we'll have a
 
01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
but under so under learn everywhere you
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
can only do it through the approved
 
01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
programs but
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
under the 30
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
6.27 i think um
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
or 329 forget the name but under the
 
01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
competency-based rules um
 
01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:28.229 align:start position:0%
competency-based rules um
theoretically

01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
theoretically
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
you could go to a school district and
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
say um yeah i've demonstrated the
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
competency in this language um
 
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
but if that school district doesn't
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
offer that language i'm not sure
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
but that's outside of learn everywhere
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's yeah yeah well healey is my reach
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
too for one they don't teach but
 
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's what concerns me though is
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
because there was a superintendent
 
01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
recently who had gotten a fight with his
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
board and one of the things they accused
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
him of was wanting to teach the students
 
01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:59.189 align:start position:0%
him of was wanting to teach the students
spanish

01:57:59.189 --> 01:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
spanish
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
well um hopefully we'll have a learn
 
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
everywhere program that will allow them
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
to get that credit
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much this hearing is
 
01:58:05.599 --> 01:58:06.629 align:start position:0%
thank you very much this hearing is
closed

01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
closed
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a three-minute break
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
or four-minute break for the committee
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
members who've been sitting here for a
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
long time to get up and stretch a little
 
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
bit and then we'll start the other
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%

is legislation that i worked with the

02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
school safety is
 
02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:24.790 align:start position:0%
school safety is
always

02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
always
 
02:06:27.910 --> 02:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
a high priority for all of us
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
and several terms ago um some of you
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
might remember um there was a
 
02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
requirement uh passed for uh school
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
emergency plans to be provided uh to the
 
02:06:40.719 --> 02:06:41.990 align:start position:0%
emergency plans to be provided uh to the
department

02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
um they got off to a little bit of a
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
rocky start um in terms of compliance
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
but it
 
02:06:50.239 --> 02:06:52.310 align:start position:0%
but it
finally

02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
finally
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
got accomplished
 
02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:55.990 align:start position:0%
got accomplished
but

02:06:55.990 --> 02:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:56.950 align:start position:0%
but
the

02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
law required
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
that the plans be sent to the department
 
02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
of education
 
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
and the way things have worked is that
 
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's not really
 
02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
the path that has been followed and that
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
the plans go to homeland security
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
so this bill was
 
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
put in
 
02:07:20.069 --> 02:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i know there are people behind me
 
02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
who will testify more to that
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
but i'll just mention also that i do
 
02:07:30.550 --> 02:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
have an amendment because the process
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
has um
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh caught up with technology uh maybe
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
we'll put it that way and there is now a
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
portal for the department of homeland
 
02:07:44.069 --> 02:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
security department of safety and plans
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
are provided in that fashion and access
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
can be provided to the department
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
via the portal so that they have access
 
02:07:56.310 --> 02:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
to these plans as well and that's what
 
02:07:58.709 --> 02:07:58.719 align:start position:0%
is addressed in the amendment um but
 
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
with that um
 
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
i'll end my testimony and i know uh
 
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
others can
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
testify in more detail if there are
 
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
questions are there questions for
 
02:08:10.870 --> 02:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli
 
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
years ago a representative cordelia when
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
director plumber perry plummer and we
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
put this together
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
and we had
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
that homeland security
 
02:08:23.669 --> 02:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
digitizing all our emergency plans which
 
02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
was wonderful and we finally did get
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
them together a little bit of a
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
hammer to do that but we got them
 
02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:32.229 align:start position:0%
hammer to do that but we got them
collected

02:08:32.229 --> 02:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
collected
 
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
now with that process occurring and with
 
02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%
what you're offering here
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
is your amendment going to move to the
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
point where the doe is
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
the plans don't shoot straight to
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
homeland security they
 
02:08:46.149 --> 02:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
there's a way for
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
the department also to have access to
 
02:08:51.030 --> 02:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
that information for various reasons i
 
02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
won't go down all those sure um yes the
 
02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.109 align:start position:0%
won't go down all those sure um yes the
actual

actual
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
addition uh in the amendment specifies
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%

02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
and i believe she filled out a pink card
 
02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
as well director harper from homeland
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
security um so she might be a part of
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
kind of this conversation um we're
 
02:09:56.950 --> 02:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
having so
 
02:09:59.109 --> 02:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
would you like to have jennifer up here
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
right with you at the same time we could
 
02:10:02.709 --> 02:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
put a third chair yeah i think i think
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
we would well and i can maybe step back
 
02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
and i'll explain it and then we'll i'll
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
let amy and it would be good
 
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
and jennifer went for amy's been a part
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
of that for quite a while exactly
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
exactly so um first of all i would like
 
02:10:16.149 --> 02:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
to thank representative cordelli for
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
putting this bill in um
 
02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:20.069 align:start position:0%
putting this bill in um
the

02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
as he explained kind of historically the
 
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
department of homeland security and
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
department of education have worked
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
together to collect and review
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
um school emergency operation plans but
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
there's still a little bit of
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
challenge with the way that the current
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
law reads and i think a little bit of
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
confusion with the agencies that could
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
be straightened out in the legislation
 
02:10:42.870 --> 02:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
going forward so in the past the
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
department of education was the person
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
or the group that was required to um
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
collect the plans
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
we at the time didn't have a great way
 
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
of doing it and homeland security took
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
the time to develop this very beautiful
 
02:10:56.229 --> 02:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
portal that i think we would like to use
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
at the department of education for other
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
reasons too
 
02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
and we they're currently using that
 
02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
portal to collect the
 
02:11:05.990 --> 02:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
school emergency operations plans they
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
also have the staff that review the
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
school emergency operations plans
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
but the weird kind of delineation is is
 
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
the department of education collects the
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
information the contact information with
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of times receives questions
 
02:11:22.950 --> 02:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
back from the department of age from
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
from schools and whatnot relative to the
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
work that's being done by homeland
 
02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:28.470 align:start position:0%
work that's being done by homeland
security

02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
security
 
02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
um we also um
 
02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know we work with homeland security
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
to give them the data and whatnot that
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
they're they need
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
for con or for contact or we would if
 
02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
you know we do what they need and what
 
02:11:41.189 --> 02:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
they request
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
but there's still just a lot of
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
confusion about what the department of
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
education does versus homeland security
 
02:11:48.790 --> 02:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
for the external participants
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
another um
 
02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
kind of challenge is that
 
02:11:55.109 --> 02:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
both agencies i think spend an
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
extraordinary amount of time
 
02:11:58.550 --> 02:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
following up to make sure that these
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
plans are collected on time and neither
 
02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
agency nor the department of education
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
or homeland security have the ability to
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
do anything if we don't receive
 
02:12:09.990 --> 02:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
a plan on time so the amount of staff
 
02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
personnel time that it takes to follow
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
up and make sure these plans are
 
02:12:12.719 --> 02:12:14.149 align:start position:0%
up and make sure these plans are
collected

02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
collected
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
is quite a bit and we have had meetings
 
02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
with homeland security you know asking
 
02:12:19.589 --> 02:12:19.599 align:start position:0%
if we had any teeth or if there were
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
anything that we could do at the
 
02:12:22.709 --> 02:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
department of education if we didn't
 
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
have a plan and there's nothing that we
 
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
can do right now
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
that we believe either so
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
um as far as the process and whatnot i'm
 
02:12:32.550 --> 02:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
going to sit back i'll let director
 
02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
harper come up here as well
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
and amy can provide any questions or
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
answers to the committee as far as the
 
02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
process or what we're kind of looking
 
02:12:42.550 --> 02:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
forward going forward and the way that
 
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
the bills are in right now
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily what needs to be done
 
02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
in the long term but there's just areas
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
of clarity that need to go one way or
 
02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
the other as far as what the legislature
 
02:12:53.910 --> 02:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
would like the process to be between the
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
two agencies just because of kind of
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
where we are right now thank you very
 
02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
much caitlyn
 
02:13:02.229 --> 02:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
so we'll replace you a jennifer harper i
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
also know there was a hammer that we did
 
02:13:06.550 --> 02:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
have to make sure those plans got in
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
there was no infrastructure funds are
 
02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:09.750 align:start position:0%
there was no infrastructure funds are
provided

02:13:09.750 --> 02:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
provided
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
until those plans were received and
 
02:13:14.470 --> 02:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
within a couple weeks all of them came
 
02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
on board so thank you for helping do
 
02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
that amy and jennifer and amy welcome
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
can we
 
02:13:22.709 --> 02:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
have any testimonies do you want to
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
present to us on this bill sure good
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
morning my name is jennifer harper i'm
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
the director for homeland security and
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
emergency management
 
02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:31.669 align:start position:0%
emergency management
so

02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:31.679 --> 02:13:32.790 align:start position:0%
so
caitlin

02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
caitlin
 
02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
kind of started out a little bit but i
 
02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:35.669 align:start position:0%
kind of started out a little bit but i
would

02:13:35.669 --> 02:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
just like to say that
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
up front
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
i had to check whether i oppose or
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
whether i support the bill i support it
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
but not as written
 
02:13:45.199 --> 02:13:45.990 align:start position:0%
but not as written
so

02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
um i think that as it's written it
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't address an all-hazards approach
 
02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
to planning
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
that meets an established career
 
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
criteria used in the field of emergency
 
02:13:57.280 --> 02:13:58.790 align:start position:0%
criteria used in the field of emergency
management

02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
management
 
02:14:01.030 --> 02:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
so we weren't asked for any fiscal
 
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
impact statement on this change and we
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
feel there is an impact to taking on
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
this additional responsibility
 
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
contemplated in the bill
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
so according to 189 64
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
hsem it says shall
 
02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
assist school districts in conducting
 
02:14:19.669 --> 02:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
training for and providing support to
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
school districts in the development
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
implementation review of emergency
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
response plan as may be needed so one of
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
the things that we need to correct is
 
02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
that term emergency
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
response plan it's not an emergency
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
response plan it's the emergency
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
operations plan so a little bit there
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
anything outside of that piece in 18964
 
02:14:44.550 --> 02:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
is above and beyond what hsem is
 
02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:46.709 align:start position:0%
is above and beyond what hsem is
authorized

02:14:46.709 --> 02:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
or funded to do by statute
 
02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:50.069 align:start position:0%
or funded to do by statute
so

02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
for example the current repository for
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
submissions like caitlyn said
 
02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
is at hsem we host that platform the
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
plans come in we share them with doe
 
02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:02.629 align:start position:0%
plans come in we share them with doe
[Music]

02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:15:02.639 --> 02:15:03.830 align:start position:0%
[Music]
then

02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
doe goes back to the schools says hey
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
you haven't submitted they come in to us
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
we report back to them so it's a lot of
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
back and forth
 
02:15:12.239 --> 02:15:13.350 align:start position:0%
back and forth
um

02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
as caitlyn said they get a lot of
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
questions that come in to them about
 
02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
school plans and looking for guidance
 
02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
those questions come to my staff
 
02:15:25.030 --> 02:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
to answer them so there's a
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
increased burden to ensuring that i have
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
the staff available to make sure that
 
02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
when the submissions come in
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
they get the technical assistance on how
 
02:15:36.069 --> 02:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
to develop their plan that meets a
 
02:15:36.079 --> 02:15:37.189 align:start position:0%
to develop their plan that meets a
statute

02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
and so it we're looking to
 
02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
clarify the legislation a little bit so
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
that it's not just a check mark right we
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that schools are safe
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
that teachers administrators sau
 
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
all the people there and the leadership
 
02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:55.109 align:start position:0%
all the people there and the leadership
responsibilities

02:15:55.109 --> 02:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
know what to do if something were to
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
happen within their school which their
 
02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
emergency operations plan
 
02:16:01.599 --> 02:16:03.109 align:start position:0%
emergency operations plan
outlines

02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
outlines
 
02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
um as caitlyn said the back and forth is
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
a little much the date in the
 
02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:10.550 align:start position:0%
a little much the date in the
rsa

02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
currently says september 1st
 
02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
we might suggest moving that date a
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
2020 and 2021 i have some statistics
 
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
not so many plans were submitted by
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
september 1st but by
 
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
the middle of october
 
02:16:33.349 --> 02:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
that number almost doubled so
 
02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
if we move the date a little bit we
 
02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
would suggest that schools would get an
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come back into session
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
get into their routine have the ability
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
to pull their local emergency planning
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
team to include the sau
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
together to review the plan and submit
 
02:16:49.439 --> 02:16:50.389 align:start position:0%
together to review the plan and submit
it

02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
thereby enhancing compliance with the
 
02:16:52.399 --> 02:16:54.309 align:start position:0%
thereby enhancing compliance with the
rsa

02:16:54.309 --> 02:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
so with respect to the workload impact
 
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
from my staff in particular
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
and trying to tighten this up just a
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
little bit so that
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
the schools the state
 
02:17:06.479 --> 02:17:07.990 align:start position:0%
the schools the state
are

02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
all on the same page
 
02:17:12.629 --> 02:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
we would suggest that we would need to
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
do some research based on best practices
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the new version of
 
02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
the federal emergency management
 
02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.270 align:start position:0%
the federal emergency management
associate

02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
associate
 
02:17:24.389 --> 02:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
agency's comprehensive planning guide
 
02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
that we'll have to do
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
we would also be required to
 
02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:30.790 align:start position:0%
we would also be required to
update

02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
update
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
and provide a functional template or
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
resource guide to the schools
 
02:17:37.110 --> 02:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
so that they can
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that their emergency operations
 
02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:40.830 align:start position:0%
ensure that their emergency operations
plan

02:17:40.830 --> 02:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:17:42.870 --> 02:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
is within
 
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
criteria that is
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
meets emergency management regulations
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
and that they can keep it up to date on
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
an annual basis
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
so we have that it has not been updated
 
02:17:59.830 --> 02:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
since august of 2020 um so
 
02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
but just remember
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
that us doing this now is outside of our
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
scope within the rsa
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
um and then the last um
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
bigger big piece
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
next piece
 
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
would be doing outreach uh an education
 
02:18:17.669 --> 02:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
of the law
 
02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
which hasn't been done to date
 
02:18:22.709 --> 02:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
which we think is pretty important my
 
02:18:25.509 --> 02:18:25.519 align:start position:0%
staff were out at a school
 
02:18:27.669 --> 02:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
the last school in the state that had
 
02:18:29.669 --> 02:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
submitted a plan
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
last week and we talked to them about
 
02:18:35.349 --> 02:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
that and they said we have no idea what
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
you're talking about that a plan is due
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
on september 1st so
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's a change in
 
02:18:43.429 --> 02:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
administration i don't know the details
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
about it but that was the conversation
 
02:18:47.910 --> 02:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
so i think some education and outreach
 
02:18:50.309 --> 02:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
about hey it's due on this date this is
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
what it should include we should do
 
02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
so with these and other changes that
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
we'd like to discuss and propose to the
 
02:18:57.840 --> 02:18:59.030 align:start position:0%
we'd like to discuss and propose to the
committee

02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
we feel that doa should absolutely
 
02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
remain involved in the process
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
specifically there's an rsa it's 189 28
 
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
that if a school doesn't submit a plan
 
02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:13.030 align:start position:0%
that if a school doesn't submit a plan
um

02:19:13.030 --> 02:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:16.629 --> 02:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
doe has the ability to hold back um some
 
02:19:18.629 --> 02:19:18.639 align:start position:0%
funding now
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
if they're not included in the bill
 
02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i know caitlin said that it's you
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
asked the question uh
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative are you still involved so
 
02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
i think they're still going to be that
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
nexus if uh it's passed as is but
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
if the committee is looking to make
 
02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:38.469 align:start position:0%
if the committee is looking to make
changes

02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't seem to quite capture
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
the necessary planning requirements
 
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we'd be glad to work with the
 
02:19:46.870 --> 02:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
sponsors to ensure that the intent is
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
clear and its expectations for the
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
schools so they know how to meet the rsa
 
02:19:51.359 --> 02:19:53.349 align:start position:0%
schools so they know how to meet the rsa
requirements

02:19:53.349 --> 02:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
and lastly i guess i already said it we
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
would love d.o.e to still be involved in
 
02:19:59.349 --> 02:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
the process
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
school emergency preparedness activities
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
we both have
 
02:20:05.110 --> 02:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
investments in what happens in the
 
02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
schools and the safety of the school
 
02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:07.670 align:start position:0%
schools and the safety of the school
kids

02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
kids
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time thank you
 
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
very much jennifer harper and i will
 
02:20:13.510 --> 02:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
assure you
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
that our primary goal is for safety and
 
02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
security in these schools
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
it needs to be tightened up
 
02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
and as chair of that commission which
 
02:20:24.870 --> 02:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
had that 30 plus million dollars we will
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
make sure if they won't get anything out
 
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
of that pot they better get these plans
 
02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:29.590 align:start position:0%
of that pot they better get these plans
in

02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's imperative it's every child
 
02:20:34.389 --> 02:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
in this state counts
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
right and we want that to be safe and
 
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
safe so correct me if i'm wrong amy but
 
02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
there is no more money in that pot we
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
have some money in that pot okay then
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know something so we'll put the word
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
out that and you know if statue says
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
something should be in by a certain date
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
we understand there's going to be a
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
little give and take on that however
 
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
we don't want these to be late there you
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
know it's
 
02:20:59.110 --> 02:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so maybe a little slide in the date
 
02:21:01.429 --> 02:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
to allow them to come back and and well
 
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know you come out of brakes or you
 
02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
probe it and all that but you know it's
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
not really an excuse to default on
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
safety and security um that we need to
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
be on top of right but i think there's
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
also the problem there's no i think
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
caitlyn senate there's not a way to
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
enforce that i think it's
 
02:21:19.439 --> 02:21:21.670 align:start position:0%
enforce that i think it's
189

02:21:21.670 --> 02:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
189
 
02:21:24.389 --> 02:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that i just said um
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
yes i understand that so we've got to do
 
02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
it through other means and there are
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
other ways the word can be gotten out
 
02:21:32.319 --> 02:21:34.309 align:start position:0%
other ways the word can be gotten out
great

02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you now amy do you have
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
anything from the department amy clark
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh so i would just as the one of the
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
people that gets the plans um they are
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
we do consider them confidential pieces
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
of information so for me it's just a
 
02:21:48.389 --> 02:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
really just talking about process-wise
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
simply process-wise when the school
 
02:21:52.389 --> 02:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
district currently has to submit them
 
02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
both to department of education and
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
homeland security it just makes a
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
process problem for me because
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
right now homeland security has the
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
secure portal
 
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
and they have granted me access to it so
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
we have no problems behind the scenes
 
02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
homeland security department of
 
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
education working well together it's
 
02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
just the law currently says they have to
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
submit them to me so which means i have
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
to receive this set of plans that i
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
don't have anywhere to store then i have
 
02:22:24.389 --> 02:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
to shred it i have 600 schools so um
 
02:22:26.309 --> 02:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
just think about 600 plans coming at me
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
that i have to shred
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
because i already have them in a secure
 
02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
portal so it's really just a process
 
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
piece that um
 
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
for me that's important just providing
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
access is great
 
02:22:38.710 --> 02:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
which i already have but if you want to
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
confirm that in law that's great
 
02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
so i guess that's the only thing i would
 
02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:44.070 align:start position:0%
so i guess that's the only thing i would
add

02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
add
 
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions from the
 
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
committee regarding this issue
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
confidentiality was a major issue when
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
these first came in and
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
when i went over to the operational
 
02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
center it's like walking into nasa
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know with what you have over there
 
02:23:00.309 --> 02:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
on the other side of town but that was
 
02:23:00.319 --> 02:23:01.110 align:start position:0%
on the other side of town but that was
and

02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:01.910 align:start position:0%
and
and

02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:03.910 --> 02:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
initially our site floor plans and all
 
02:23:06.030 --> 02:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
that weren't being submitted due to
 
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and
 
02:23:08.240 --> 02:23:09.190 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and
issues

02:23:09.190 --> 02:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
however i think we've overcome that now
 
02:23:12.870 --> 02:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
there is a need to collaborate between
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
the two departments
 
02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely we have training
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
various policies and how these plans
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
work operational plans work or don't
 
02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:22.950 align:start position:0%
work operational plans work or don't
work

02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's got to be a collaborative effort
 
02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:26.469 align:start position:0%
it's got to be a collaborative effort
so

02:23:26.469 --> 02:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
we encourage you to work together we
 
02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:31.600 align:start position:0%

02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%

together
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%

from hillsborough 37 which is hudson and
 
02:26:02.790 --> 02:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
pelham thank you very much
 
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
first i want to say that this bill as
 
02:26:08.230 --> 02:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
written does not capture my intent
 
02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
i ran out of time to get this ready i
 
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
was down helping my brother who had
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
heart failure i was staying with my mom
 
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
who didn't have internet access and
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
trying to do this on my phone was very
 
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
difficult and i ran out of time and was
 
02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:22.309 align:start position:0%
difficult and i ran out of time and was
told

02:26:22.309 --> 02:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
told
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
just submitted amendment so that's what
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
i'm working on
 
02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:27.429 align:start position:0%
i'm working on
um

02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
so yes some of the things objections
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
that i've seen and that i know are
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
because of the way it ended up being
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
worded which does not express
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
my intent
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
so why did i
 
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
why was this even something that was on
 
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
my radar and it was from talking to and
 
02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:45.830 align:start position:0%
my radar and it was from talking to and
hearing

02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:26:47.429 --> 02:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
combination of talking to and hearing
 
02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
complaints from students and teachers
 
02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
but also from conversations i'd had with
 
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
both high school students and adults who
 
02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
thought that slavery for instance only
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
happened in the united states
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
and we had a war and it's done
 
02:27:06.469 --> 02:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
and clearly that's not the case we have
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
slate we've had slavery just about since
 
02:27:10.950 --> 02:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
the beginning of humanity
 
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:27:14.790 --> 02:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
slavery currently in the world we have
 
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
it in the united states and we have it
 
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and so
 
02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
i consider the idea that it only
 
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
happened here in the united states we
 
02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
fought a war and it was done to be a
 
02:27:27.990 --> 02:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
very dangerous learning
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
it probably wasn't intentional it was
 
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
probably just because in the curriculum
 
02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
you're teaching american history so
 
02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's part of american history but the
 
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
whole setting is not given and if we
 
02:27:43.349 --> 02:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
don't realize that just um fighting the
 
02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
civil war ended some slavery but it did
 
02:27:48.710 --> 02:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
not end all slavery in the united states
 
02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
just making it illegal didn't end it
 
02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
slavery is a horrible despicable thing
 
02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
always was always will be and unless we
 
02:28:00.870 --> 02:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
are alert to what is happening what has
 
02:28:02.950 --> 02:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
happened in the world and what
 
02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
is happening now
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
we will not be on the lookout for it and
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
i could be our neighbor and we wouldn't
 
02:28:14.389 --> 02:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
even know and yes i have spoken to
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
a woman who was a slave a sex slave
 
02:28:20.070 --> 02:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
throughout her junior high in high
 
02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:21.190 align:start position:0%
throughout her junior high in high
school

02:28:21.190 --> 02:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:22.550 align:start position:0%
school
and

02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
nobody knew because nobody was looking
 
02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
for it it's a horrible thing
 
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
and we need to be on the lookout so my
 
02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
intent was to expand when i when i put
 
02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:32.870 align:start position:0%
intent was to expand when i when i put
in

02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
in
um

02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:33.330 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:33.330 --> 02:28:35.510 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
not limited to teaching well no no when
 
02:28:40.870 --> 02:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
i put in um
 
02:28:44.469 --> 02:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
worldwide context that was my goal was
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
to get it out there so that we weren't
 
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
limited to oh the us did this this
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
happened this was horrible and now it's
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
over but
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know it's ongoing
 
02:28:57.270 --> 02:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
we need to be always vigilant to make
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
sure it doesn't happen again to make
 
02:29:02.950 --> 02:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
another thing
 
02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:05.750 align:start position:0%
another thing
that

02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:07.190 align:start position:0%
that
really

02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
got me was that a lot of times under the
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
idea of teaching
 
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully it's rare but it definitely is
 
02:29:20.389 --> 02:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
happening in our state teachers who are
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
not educating but indoctrinating
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i see that as very
 
02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:26.870 align:start position:0%
and i see that as very
harmful

02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
harmful
 
02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
to students
 
02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
and to thought processes
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
and all of that
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
education and indoctrination and so just
 
02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:41.750 align:start position:0%
education and indoctrination and so just
to

02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
clarify that i'll talk about
 
02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
education of religion
 
02:29:50.550 --> 02:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
so if you're educating religion you
 
02:29:50.560 --> 02:29:51.429 align:start position:0%
so if you're educating religion you
might

02:29:51.429 --> 02:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
might
 
02:29:53.349 --> 02:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
come up with a list of the various world
 
02:29:55.910 --> 02:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
religions you might ask your students to
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
each pick one
 
02:30:00.630 --> 02:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
go away do research come back report to
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
the rest of the class on it you might
 
02:30:04.550 --> 02:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
have your class look at all of the
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
various religions you've looked at and
 
02:30:09.190 --> 02:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
find similarities across them
 
02:30:11.670 --> 02:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
differences across them depending upon
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
the age group you're working in you
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
might go into wars that were fought in
 
02:30:17.670 --> 02:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
the name of religion talk about whether
 
02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:18.389 align:start position:0%
the name of religion talk about whether
that

02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:30:18.399 --> 02:30:19.750 align:start position:0%
that
actually

02:30:19.750 --> 02:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
was legitimate according to those people
 
02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
who professed that religion you could
 
02:30:27.990 --> 02:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
talk about was that really what the war
 
02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
was about you could get into underlying
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
were there other things economic etc
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
you could get into genocide that has
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
happened in the name of religion and etc
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
you could go very in depth with that
 
02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's teaching okay you're engaging the
 
02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
students you're asking them questions
 
02:30:47.670 --> 02:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
they're having them do research you're
 
02:30:49.830 --> 02:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
having them think you're all of that
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's teaching on the other hand if i
 
02:30:54.710 --> 02:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
were to try to persuade you that my
 
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
religion is the right religion
 
02:31:00.309 --> 02:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
if i were to ask questions on a test
 
02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
that if you didn't go along with that
 
02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:05.110 align:start position:0%
that if you didn't go along with that
then

02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know then you got a bad grade
 
02:31:09.429 --> 02:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
that's indoctrination and i think pretty
 
02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
much everybody in this room would agree
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
that that's wrong when i talk about
 
02:31:16.150 --> 02:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
religion but it's the same thing whether
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
i talk about political ideology whether
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
i talk about economic ideology
 
02:31:24.870 --> 02:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
any ideology any theory
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
that's taught that is taught that is
 
02:31:29.349 --> 02:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
educated that asks students
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
that engages discussion that does all of
 
02:31:35.110 --> 02:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
that that's education when i start
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
pressing for my point of view my belief
 
02:31:40.070 --> 02:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
system my political belief system
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
economic belief system whatever when i
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
start doing that then i'm indoctrinating
 
02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
when i only accept an answer that says
 
02:31:50.309 --> 02:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
that my political beliefs are right and
 
02:31:51.990 --> 02:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
your beliefs are wrong
 
02:31:54.070 --> 02:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's indoctrination just like we
 
02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to do it with religion we
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to do it with any theory with
 
02:31:58.800 --> 02:31:59.810 align:start position:0%
don't want to do it with any theory with
any

02:31:59.810 --> 02:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:01.190 align:start position:0%

02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
any of that and so that's what i'm
 
02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
hearing is happening in some places
 
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully not many but they're certainly
 
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's not a school it's not a teacher i'm
 
02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
hearing it from numerous different
 
02:32:17.830 --> 02:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
schools and numerous different teachers
 
02:32:19.990 --> 02:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
that they are indoctrinating
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
not teaching
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
and so that was
 
02:32:27.429 --> 02:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure it's going to come up
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
in the bill i had
 
02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
said not limited to teaching the united
 
02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
states was founded on racism that is
 
02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
actually an a theory
 
02:32:44.469 --> 02:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest that if it was
 
02:32:47.349 --> 02:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
founded on racism the word founded as
 
02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:49.990 align:start position:0%
opposed to
had

02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
racism existed when the country was
 
02:32:53.429 --> 02:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
founded those are two very different
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
statements racism definitely existed
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
when the country was founded that's why
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
we had slavery
 
02:33:01.270 --> 02:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
but we also had people from the
 
02:33:03.270 --> 02:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
beginning who fought against slavery we
 
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
had people who fought against that if
 
02:33:07.510 --> 02:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
the world was not divided if the united
 
02:33:10.230 --> 02:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
states was not divided on that issue if
 
02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
there were not a huge number of people
 
02:33:14.790 --> 02:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
like half the country at least who
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
believed that slavery was wrong and
 
02:33:18.550 --> 02:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
despicable and evil we wouldn't have had
 
02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
a civil war so to be able to say it was
 
02:33:23.670 --> 02:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
founded on racism when clearly half of
 
02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
the country
 
02:33:28.230 --> 02:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
you know disagreed that's hardly founded
 
02:33:30.950 --> 02:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
on that's founded with the existence of
 
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
those are two very different things and
 
02:33:35.429 --> 02:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
i just want to get that out there that
 
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's another that's teaching
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
a theory or an idea as opposed to a
 
02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:49.349 --> 02:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
at any rate that's um that was my intent
 
02:33:51.429 --> 02:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
i am working on a
 
02:33:51.439 --> 02:33:53.510 align:start position:0%
i am working on a
amendment

02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
it is still not worded to my
 
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
satisfaction i want to make it clear so
 
02:34:00.790 --> 02:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
that nobody can misread or misinterpret
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
what it says thank you very much and
 
02:34:03.910 --> 02:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'll be willing to take it thank you
 
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions for
 
02:34:09.510 --> 02:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
the presenter representative tanner
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
question i was wondering if you'd expand
 
02:34:14.710 --> 02:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
on your statement theory versus proven
 
02:34:19.830 --> 02:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
reality and what a proven reality
 
02:34:21.349 --> 02:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
how we would know it was a proven
 
02:34:23.270 --> 02:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
reality rather than
 
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
a theory well i gotta say i have to say
 
02:34:27.830 --> 02:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
as a physicist
 
02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
and a mathematician
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to have a proven
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
fact and that's why it's very important
 
02:34:37.830 --> 02:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
to introduce things as a theory and not
 
02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
a fact now if i had an apple and an
 
02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
apple and i said that one apple plus one
 
02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
apple is two apples i think most of us
 
02:34:47.190 --> 02:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
would agree that that was a fact but
 
02:34:49.110 --> 02:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of stuff even
 
02:34:50.469 --> 02:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
somebody said to me the other day what
 
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
about the theory of relativity and i
 
02:34:54.070 --> 02:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
said there's a reason it's called that
 
02:34:55.830 --> 02:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
there are still physicists who disagree
 
02:34:56.790 --> 02:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
who don't think that's true and are
 
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
still trying to find exceptions
 
02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:01.910 align:start position:0%
still trying to find exceptions
if

02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:35:04.950 --> 02:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
you can find an exception and exception
 
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
that disproves the rule
 
02:35:09.590 --> 02:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
so if i can find an exception to your
 
02:35:12.150 --> 02:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
theory then it's still just a theory it
 
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
is not a fact
 
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
follow our uh another any other
 
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
questions represent corneli
 
02:35:21.349 --> 02:35:21.359 align:start position:0%

representative

02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:23.349 align:start position:0%
representative
um

02:35:23.349 --> 02:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that this statute
 
02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
dates back to the cold war
 
02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:31.590 align:start position:0%
dates back to the cold war
and

02:35:31.590 --> 02:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
from your testimony
 
02:35:35.670 --> 02:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
am i correct to understand
 
02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:36.710 align:start position:0%
am i correct to understand
that

02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
you're in the midst of ongoing attempts
 
02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
to find language to update this statute
 
02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
that is exactly right in fact it was
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
originally from the 1940s
 
02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
and it and there was involved a teacher
 
02:35:57.429 --> 02:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
oath of loyalty which swore loyalty to
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
the constitution of the united states
 
02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire that part's been taken
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
out it's been updated a number of times
 
02:36:07.270 --> 02:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
and yes i'm working to further update it
 
02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
and try to make it clear
 
02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:10.710 align:start position:0%
and try to make it clear
but

02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:11.830 align:start position:0%
but
current

02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further questions

thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there are many case
 
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
you have reports of many cases of
 
02:36:26.309 --> 02:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
indoctrination of students
 
02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
what schools in new hampshire is that
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
taking place in
 
02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
you've caught me on the spot i did not
 
02:36:35.590 --> 02:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
come up with a list i have read
 
02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
letters from
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
parents i have talked personally to
 
02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
parents but i'm not real good at
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
remembering and i would not want to name
 
02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
a school that and say the wrong one
 
02:36:50.469 --> 02:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
i can get you the information for some
 
02:36:52.230 --> 02:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
of them if you would like i can go back
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
through my emails
 
02:36:56.070 --> 02:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i i'm sure i won't get all of them
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
but i can give you some
 
02:36:59.429 --> 02:36:59.439 align:start position:0%

my question in the list at the beginning
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
and i know this comes from that earlier
 
02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:14.710 align:start position:0%
and i know this comes from that earlier
law

02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
you have no teacher shall advocate
 
02:37:20.309 --> 02:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
communism socialism or marxism and those
 
02:37:22.870 --> 02:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
are all philosophies and things that are
 
02:37:25.349 --> 02:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
to the very far far far left i'm
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
wondering why you didn't think to
 
02:37:30.270 --> 02:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
include things like fascism and
 
02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
totalitarianism and authoritarianism and
 
02:37:35.429 --> 02:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
not white nationalism on the far far
 
02:37:37.110 --> 02:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
left right
 
02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um actually those
 
02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
are in my amendment some of them and if
 
02:37:42.790 --> 02:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
you would like to give me the rest of
 
02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
that list i'll be glad to add it yes
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
that was just a first draft like i said
 
02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
those were put in somebody else said
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
well what about fascism and i was like
 
02:37:57.990 --> 02:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
great idea and so yes they should yes
 
02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.630 align:start position:0%
great idea and so yes they should yes
absolutely

02:38:00.630 --> 02:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:38:03.030 --> 02:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you represent luna
 
02:38:04.469 --> 02:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
you very much representative uh for um
 
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question um something that
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
we uh frequently asked um two years ago
 
02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
in this committee when uh when when a
 
02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
bill was being introduced
 
02:38:22.710 --> 02:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
is um is what is the intent what is your
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
intent as the prime sponsor and so i'd
 
02:38:27.270 --> 02:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
like to ask you that question what is
 
02:38:28.950 --> 02:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
your intent as the prime minister okay i
 
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
thought i had covered that but i will
 
02:38:34.230 --> 02:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
say it again my intent is to make sure
 
02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
that teachers are educating and not
 
02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:39.110 align:start position:0%
that teachers are educating and not
indoctrinating

02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
indoctrinating
 
02:38:44.469 --> 02:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%

02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
member here
 
02:39:19.270 --> 02:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
i am here today to speak in favor of
 
02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 1255 and the evolving
 
02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
amendments the intention here is to make
 
02:39:27.270 --> 02:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
certain that in our schools our teachers
 
02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
are doing what has happened for a long
 
02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:30.070 align:start position:0%
are doing what has happened for a long
time

02:39:30.070 --> 02:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:39:33.510 --> 02:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
teaching how to think not what to think
 
02:39:36.550 --> 02:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
i've heard cases of teachers speaking
 
02:39:38.790 --> 02:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
about the founders all being racist and
 
02:39:41.110 --> 02:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
this country is bad because of it
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's not how to think that is telling
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
them what to think and that should not
 
02:39:46.870 --> 02:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
be acceptable that teacher i believe was
 
02:39:49.190 --> 02:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
disciplined that happened many years ago
 
02:39:51.110 --> 02:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
but these things do happen in our
 
02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:53.190 align:start position:0%
but these things do happen in our
schools

02:39:53.190 --> 02:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:39:55.990 --> 02:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
as we address this issue i like the idea
 
02:39:58.150 --> 02:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
that we're expanding it not just into
 
02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
these economic and social models but
 
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
also including it to fascism and these
 
02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:02.710 align:start position:0%
also including it to fascism and these
other

02:40:02.710 --> 02:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
areas that we need to discuss
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
but we can't
 
02:40:08.870 --> 02:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
hold the students to
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
follow the teacher's belief
 
02:40:12.790 --> 02:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
or know what the teacher is advocating
 
02:40:14.710 --> 02:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
for so that they answer the test and
 
02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
they start parroting lines that say
 
02:40:19.590 --> 02:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
this is what i believe because i think
 
02:40:21.750 --> 02:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
it will get a better grade
 
02:40:24.150 --> 02:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
i come from a time when teachers hid
 
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
their affiliations and their personal
 
02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
viewpoints so that the students might
 
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
try and figure out
 
02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
actually so what does this teacher think
 
02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
because they're curious not having it
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
come at them all the time
 
02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:37.590 align:start position:0%
come at them all the time
i

02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:40:40.870 --> 02:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
i believe very much in free discussion
 
02:40:43.590 --> 02:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the less that the
 
02:40:45.269 --> 02:40:45.279 align:start position:0%
more that we can make sure
 
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
that the teachers opinions are not
 
02:40:49.990 --> 02:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
coloring the lesson plan the more that
 
02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
we can have honest discussions and truly
 
02:40:53.429 --> 02:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
understand why
 
02:40:55.830 --> 02:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
some of these things are so truly awful
 
02:40:57.429 --> 02:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
if they can discuss and play around with
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
the ideas instead of just hearing that
 
02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's bad
 
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
if we can discuss the context and the
 
02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
way that these atrocities have happened
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
in our world we can better see them if
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
they're coming down again in history
 
02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
because history repeats and our job
 
02:41:16.710 --> 02:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
is to avoid the major mistakes of the
 
02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:17.670 align:start position:0%
is to avoid the major mistakes of the
past

02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
past
 
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
and to try and write them and without
 
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
honest discussion we can't do that
 
02:41:23.190 --> 02:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
02:41:24.550 --> 02:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
02:41:26.389 --> 02:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
questions represent ellison
 
02:41:28.230 --> 02:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for taking my
 
02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:29.110 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for taking my
question

02:41:29.110 --> 02:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:41:31.269 --> 02:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
i think you started by saying you
 
02:41:33.269 --> 02:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
support the bill as written
 
02:41:33.279 --> 02:41:34.070 align:start position:0%
support the bill as written
and

02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:36.150 --> 02:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
amendments that are forthcoming have you
 
02:41:37.910 --> 02:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
seen amendments that are forthcoming to
 
02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:41:41.030 --> 02:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i said that i
 
02:41:43.110 --> 02:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
support the bill and the evolving
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
amendment process
 
02:41:46.389 --> 02:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
in the presentation from the prime
 
02:41:48.790 --> 02:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor an amendment was discussed in
 
02:41:51.190 --> 02:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
order to try and address these issues
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
and i agree that the intent i'm a
 
02:41:56.469 --> 02:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor we worked on this but we were
 
02:41:59.429 --> 02:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
up against serious family issues as we
 
02:42:01.110 --> 02:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
as we were trying to get this out the
 
02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:01.910 align:start position:0%
as we were trying to get this out the
door

02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
door
 
02:42:04.870 --> 02:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
so i i do expect that something that
 
02:42:07.030 --> 02:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
that takes all of the insight that we've
 
02:42:09.429 --> 02:42:09.439 align:start position:0%
had ever since you know people started
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
talking specifically about this bill we
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
had wonderful insight there was some
 
02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
great discussion from a board of
 
02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
education member and incorporating
 
02:42:20.389 --> 02:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
that will make this a much stronger bill
 
02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
that does what we want it to do make
 
02:42:24.150 --> 02:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
sure the teachers are teaching what to
 
02:42:26.790 --> 02:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
think not how to think
 
02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:31.910 --> 02:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
you reversed i'm sorry
 
02:42:34.230 --> 02:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
i did june and july's in option trading
 
02:42:35.830 --> 02:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
and that cost me a lot of money when i
 
02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
mixed up my words so yes
 
02:42:40.070 --> 02:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
teach how to think not what to think
 
02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:43.190 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
questions

02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
nasini thank you very much thank you
 
02:42:56.870 --> 02:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm representative
 
02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
timothy horrigan from stratfor county
 
02:43:02.550 --> 02:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
district six the towns of durham and
 
02:43:04.389 --> 02:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
madbury the home of
 
02:43:06.309 --> 02:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
home of unh and the oyster river
 
02:43:09.670 --> 02:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district um
 
02:43:12.550 --> 02:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
first of all there should be uh
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
i mean i think uh obviously even the
 
02:43:16.309 --> 02:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor when the co-sponsors
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
expressed misgivings about this bill and
 
02:43:20.309 --> 02:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
there um supposedly there's gonna be an
 
02:43:23.590 --> 02:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
amendment i from what i've heard i don't
 
02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:24.710 align:start position:0%
amendment i from what i've heard i don't
know

02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:43:26.469 --> 02:43:26.479 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think just anything's
 
02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
going to come out of it that i'm going
 
02:43:29.269 --> 02:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
to be too eager to vote for even though
 
02:43:30.870 --> 02:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
there may be some what about ism by
 
02:43:33.510 --> 02:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
putting in fascisms and stuff i i think
 
02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:34.790 align:start position:0%
putting in fascisms and stuff i i think
um

02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:36.550 --> 02:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
i think this whole uh
 
02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
i think this whole statute should go so
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
the appropriate thing to do with rsa 191
 
02:43:43.269 --> 02:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
is not to
 
02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
add the sexual language
 
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
to it but to just to delete the whole
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
thing um
 
02:43:50.870 --> 02:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
actually i went to a private uh
 
02:43:52.710 --> 02:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
religious high school in massachusetts
 
02:43:54.150 --> 02:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
north american school and actually my
 
02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
favorite teacher
 
02:43:55.439 --> 02:43:56.309 align:start position:0%
favorite teacher
um

02:43:56.309 --> 02:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
when i was there in 11th and 12th grade
 
02:44:01.110 --> 02:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
was senor shepard who was uh
 
02:44:03.510 --> 02:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
the ice hockey coach and also a i think
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
he actually really was a communist he
 
02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
did uh go to cuba in the
 
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
early 1970s with the
 
02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:11.269 align:start position:0%
early 1970s with the
um

02:44:11.269 --> 02:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
but um he was uh
 
02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
and he did i mean he didn't indoctrinate
 
02:44:17.349 --> 02:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
us i'm not sure the term indoctrination
 
02:44:18.950 --> 02:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
means other than teaching students
 
02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
something that you don't approve of he
 
02:44:21.750 --> 02:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
certainly didn't indoctrinate this he's
 
02:44:23.429 --> 02:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
a fine teacher but i
 
02:44:24.950 --> 02:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
will say he didn't do that much harm
 
02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:25.830 align:start position:0%
will say he didn't do that much harm
because

02:44:25.830 --> 02:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:44:28.550 --> 02:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
um i'm not a communist i
 
02:44:30.630 --> 02:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
can't skate and my spanish is still
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
atrocious so the amount of harm that was
 
02:44:34.710 --> 02:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
done by having a communist
 
02:44:36.870 --> 02:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
teaching me spanish in 11th 12th grade
 
02:44:39.110 --> 02:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
at least is pretty minimal so
 
02:44:40.469 --> 02:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
um those
 
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
we have um this uh
 
02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
the 1949 bill passed at the height of
 
02:44:46.309 --> 02:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
the cold wars others have correctly
 
02:44:48.309 --> 02:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
noted uh just mentioned communism
 
02:44:51.990 --> 02:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
another adding socialism and marxism and
 
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know being
 
02:44:55.590 --> 02:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know being an adherent daniel's
 
02:44:58.150 --> 02:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
philosophy is um it's not illegal um
 
02:44:58.160 --> 02:44:58.950 align:start position:0%
philosophy is um it's not illegal um
there's

02:44:58.950 --> 02:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:45:01.510 --> 02:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
um it's not even not even wrong
 
02:45:03.429 --> 02:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
especially in the case of uh
 
02:45:05.510 --> 02:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
socialism and marxism a lot of the ideas
 
02:45:07.349 --> 02:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
behind it insofar as those terms of any
 
02:45:08.950 --> 02:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
meaning at all
 
02:45:10.950 --> 02:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
are deeply embedded in our society in
 
02:45:12.389 --> 02:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
fact i even heard
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
so from ways and means a couple of days
 
02:45:16.950 --> 02:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
and we were there's a debate about uh a
 
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill about remote
 
02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents who work for
 
02:45:22.950 --> 02:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
massachusetts companies and he was
 
02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor
 
02:45:25.830 --> 02:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure he's getting that as several
 
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
moves this wasn't intentional he
 
02:45:31.110 --> 02:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
actually gave me an explanation for why
 
02:45:33.030 --> 02:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
the actually actually feels needed they
 
02:45:36.870 --> 02:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
came right out of marx's labor theory of
 
02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
of of value like as uh as as
 
02:45:42.790 --> 02:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
embodied in das capital a lot of others
 
02:45:44.309 --> 02:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sure he didn't uh
 
02:45:45.750 --> 02:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sure he wasn't getting it directly
 
02:45:47.190 --> 02:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
from dos capital but it was kind of an
 
02:45:49.429 --> 02:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
amusing uh amazing thing we said about
 
02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
the role of
 
02:45:54.950 --> 02:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
labor and creating value and
 
02:45:57.110 --> 02:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
um as for the uh
 
02:45:59.990 --> 02:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
racism slavery did exist elsewhere it
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
still uh
 
02:46:03.990 --> 02:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
it still exists uh in other parts of the
 
02:46:06.630 --> 02:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
world but uh it was deeply embedded in
 
02:46:08.710 --> 02:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
the founding of the 13 colonies and the
 
02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
united states and
 
02:46:12.510 --> 02:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
one of the many factors that led the
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
revolutionary war was uh you know
 
02:46:18.070 --> 02:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know great britain was
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh liberalizing its policies about
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
slavery and we weren't ready to go we
 
02:46:23.830 --> 02:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
weren't ready to go along with it even
 
02:46:25.750 --> 02:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
even here in new england we
 
02:46:27.910 --> 02:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
financed the plantations
 
02:46:29.110 --> 02:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
our uh
 
02:46:31.590 --> 02:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
our entrepreneurs owned the
 
02:46:33.269 --> 02:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
on the ships brought to slaves to the
 
02:46:34.710 --> 02:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
south so we're not our hands aren't and
 
02:46:36.710 --> 02:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
there were many slaves who lived up here
 
02:46:38.469 --> 02:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
in the north so like our hands aren't
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
clean of that uh
 
02:46:41.830 --> 02:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
are aren't clean of that either and that
 
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
probably uh
 
02:46:45.429 --> 02:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
probably should be taught and then also
 
02:46:45.439 --> 02:46:46.870 align:start position:0%
probably should be taught and then also
um

02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:49.269 --> 02:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
and also like the threat to uh
 
02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
the threat to the teachers that they can
 
02:46:54.469 --> 02:46:54.479 align:start position:0%
be vying for ethics if somebody objects
 
02:46:56.070 --> 02:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
to their political views that's also
 
02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
very chilling that uh
 
02:46:59.830 --> 02:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
really is out of this of the cold war
 
02:47:02.070 --> 02:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm um
 
02:47:04.309 --> 02:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
also just for the sake of sake of uh
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
full disclosure i'm old enough to
 
02:47:07.990 --> 02:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
remember the cold war so i was born in
 
02:47:10.469 --> 02:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
1956 when you know the cold war was
 
02:47:13.670 --> 02:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
still going on and um
 
02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
and there was definitely a great fear of
 
02:47:19.110 --> 02:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
communism now we're
 
02:47:20.790 --> 02:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
and we're still afraid of uh russia and
 
02:47:22.070 --> 02:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
china but they're very different from
 
02:47:23.590 --> 02:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
what they are now certainly the soviet
 
02:47:25.590 --> 02:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
union in spite of what's going on the
 
02:47:27.750 --> 02:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
board of ukraine no longer exists in
 
02:47:29.670 --> 02:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
that form china has been continuously
 
02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
ruled by the chinese communist party but
 
02:47:33.429 --> 02:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
you know it's a very different
 
02:47:37.030 --> 02:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
place than it was in miles miles here
 
02:47:39.190 --> 02:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm going
 
02:47:41.190 --> 02:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
so i just i just don't
 
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
know that it should be illegal to teach
 
02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
those things in school because they have
 
02:47:46.830 --> 02:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
had a lot so that's
 
02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
um that's what i heard you do probably
 
02:47:51.190 --> 02:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
just uh uses opportunity to delete the
 
02:47:53.110 --> 02:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
entire obsolete statute from the bill
 
02:47:54.389 --> 02:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're
 
02:47:56.870 --> 02:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
struggling so much with the uh
 
02:47:58.150 --> 02:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
02:48:00.150 --> 02:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
struggling wording probably indicates
 
02:48:02.389 --> 02:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
not so much that um
 
02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
anything wrong with our drafting
 
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys probably this was just uh not
 
02:48:07.590 --> 02:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
a good idea and uh it's the best thing
 
02:48:08.389 --> 02:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:48:10.469 --> 02:48:10.479 align:start position:0%
uses an opportunity to strike
 
02:48:13.190 --> 02:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
the entirety of rsa 191 from the uh from
 
02:48:14.870 --> 02:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
the law books that would be i think a
 
02:48:17.670 --> 02:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
great blow for
 
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
academic freedom and for good education
 
02:48:21.269 --> 02:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
at all levels so um
 
02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
that's why that's my testimony thank you
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
very much representative are there any
 
02:48:27.590 --> 02:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
 
02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
not seeing any
 
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
hands thank you very much and as usual i
 
02:48:32.710 --> 02:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
ran over my two minutes but i apologize
 
02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
but thanks
 
02:48:38.309 --> 02:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:51.830 --> 02:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:54.309 --> 02:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'll be very brief
 
02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
i pass around to the committee
 
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
the history of the statute
 
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
so you should have a copy of that
 
02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
as it was referenced it goes back to
 
02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:06.469 align:start position:0%
as it was referenced it goes back to
1949.

02:49:06.469 --> 02:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
1949.
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:14.070 --> 02:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
02:49:17.030 --> 02:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
the seventh page it has 1108 at the top
 
02:49:19.590 --> 02:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
left corner
 
02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's a discussion about amending the
 
02:49:24.309 --> 02:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
statute so originally it had
 
02:49:27.429 --> 02:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
the prohibition it had an oath that was
 
02:49:30.230 --> 02:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
required for teachers to take
 
02:49:31.910 --> 02:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
and it had
 
02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
a penalty if you didn't take the oath
 
02:49:36.870 --> 02:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
and enforcement was to be done by the
 
02:49:39.190 --> 02:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
02:49:40.389 --> 02:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
and there was an exception if you
 
02:49:41.830 --> 02:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
weren't a citizen so that's basically
 
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
the the full statute that existed at the
 
02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:44.870 align:start position:0%
the the full statute that existed at the
time

02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:49:46.469 --> 02:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
what's interesting on that seventh page
 
02:49:48.710 --> 02:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
there's a discussion uh the senate
 
02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:51.030 align:start position:0%
there's a discussion uh the senate
record

02:49:51.030 --> 02:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
record
 
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
and it talks about leaving in
 
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
senator humphrey
 
02:49:58.710 --> 02:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
removed the other stat the other
 
02:50:00.550 --> 02:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
provisions of the statute
 
02:50:03.269 --> 02:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
but he left in
 
02:50:05.269 --> 02:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
this idea
 
02:50:05.279 --> 02:50:07.269 align:start position:0%
this idea
that

02:50:07.269 --> 02:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:50:08.870 --> 02:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't want teachers to
 
02:50:12.389 --> 02:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
indoctrinate children with communism so
 
02:50:13.590 --> 02:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
that was uh
 
02:50:14.870 --> 02:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
that was
 
02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
decidedly left in so i thank the sponsor
 
02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:18.870 align:start position:0%
decidedly left in so i thank the sponsor
for

02:50:18.870 --> 02:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
updating the statute
 
02:50:25.030 --> 02:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:26.710 --> 02:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's not something that we'd
 
02:50:29.110 --> 02:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
want uh teachers to use their position
 
02:50:31.030 --> 02:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
to do so what's interesting in that
 
02:50:32.630 --> 02:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
discussion also is that
 
02:50:34.309 --> 02:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
it points out that public school
 
02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
teachers are government employees
 
02:50:38.790 --> 02:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
and you know originally this was an oath
 
02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
that they took
 
02:50:42.630 --> 02:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
we all took an oath to our office
 
02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
we were sworn in by the governor
 
02:50:46.389 --> 02:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
we had to raise our hand and take an
 
02:50:48.630 --> 02:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
oath so it's not something that's
 
02:50:51.190 --> 02:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
uncommon uh to do so
 
02:50:52.550 --> 02:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for the oath to be
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
brought back but we are asking for

um
 
02:51:24.630 --> 02:51:24.640 align:start position:0%

moffatt uh representative canterbury and
 
02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
loudoun merrimack district nine
 
02:51:31.830 --> 02:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
as a legislator as a columnist who
 
02:51:34.469 --> 02:51:34.479 align:start position:0%
values the first amendment
 
02:51:36.790 --> 02:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
is a professor who values academic
 
02:51:40.510 --> 02:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
freedom i cannot speak in favor of hb
 
02:51:44.230 --> 02:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
1255 as it is currently worded
 
02:51:45.750 --> 02:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i have set this testimony
 
02:51:48.870 --> 02:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
electronically to the committee uh words
 
02:51:48.880 --> 02:51:50.230 align:start position:0%
electronically to the committee uh words
matter

02:51:50.230 --> 02:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
matter
 
02:51:52.469 --> 02:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
but words matter beyond just the wording
 
02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
of hb 1255.
 
02:51:56.110 --> 02:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
when folks
 
02:51:58.870 --> 02:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
pejoratively mischaracterize for example
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
the efa program school choice program
 
02:52:03.269 --> 02:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
and repeatedly refer to it as a voucher
 
02:52:03.279 --> 02:52:04.230 align:start position:0%
and repeatedly refer to it as a voucher
program

02:52:04.230 --> 02:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:52:07.030 --> 02:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
they do a disservice to citizens
 
02:52:09.110 --> 02:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
who deserve honesty
 
02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's not about your program look up the
 
02:52:14.630 --> 02:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
definition of voucher words matter
 
02:52:16.469 --> 02:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
when people repeatedly
 
02:52:18.230 --> 02:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
refer to the new
 
02:52:21.190 --> 02:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
so-called divisive concepts law
 
02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
they do a disservice to citizens who
 
02:52:24.950 --> 02:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
deserve honesty
 
02:52:27.750 --> 02:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
those words are not in statute but i
 
02:52:29.429 --> 02:52:29.439 align:start position:0%
keep hearing time and time again in this
 
02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
committee and elsewhere about the
 
02:52:33.750 --> 02:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
divisive concepts law there is no such
 
02:52:33.760 --> 02:52:36.950 align:start position:0%
divisive concepts law there is no such
thing

02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.870 --> 02:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
those words are not in the statute which
 
02:52:41.190 --> 02:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
simply calls for everyone to be treated
 
02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
the same to be treated equally under the
 
02:52:46.630 --> 02:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
law that's what is in the new statute
 
02:52:48.790 --> 02:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
with no groups being favored over other
 
02:52:48.800 --> 02:52:49.830 align:start position:0%
with no groups being favored over other
groups

02:52:49.830 --> 02:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
groups
 
02:52:51.429 --> 02:52:51.439 align:start position:0%
who can argue with that
 
02:52:51.439 --> 02:52:52.389 align:start position:0%
who can argue with that
words

02:52:52.389 --> 02:52:52.399 align:start position:0%
words
 
02:52:52.399 --> 02:52:53.910 align:start position:0%
words
matter

02:52:53.910 --> 02:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
matter
 
02:52:55.750 --> 02:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
when people repeatedly claim that
 
02:52:58.389 --> 02:52:58.399 align:start position:0%
critical race theory is not being taught
 
02:53:00.070 --> 02:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire they again do a
 
02:53:02.150 --> 02:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
disservice to citizens who deserve
 
02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:03.750 align:start position:0%
disservice to citizens who deserve
honesty

02:53:03.750 --> 02:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
honesty
 
02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
words matter
 
02:53:07.990 --> 02:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
elements of critical race theory are
 
02:53:11.670 --> 02:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
parts of instruction all over the state
 
02:53:14.469 --> 02:53:14.479 align:start position:0%
a constituent of mine sent me a video
 
02:53:16.389 --> 02:53:16.399 align:start position:0%
she claimed was shown to her seventh
 
02:53:16.399 --> 02:53:17.590 align:start position:0%
she claimed was shown to her seventh
grade

02:53:17.590 --> 02:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
grade
 
02:53:19.990 --> 02:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
son's class it was entitled an
 
02:53:21.830 --> 02:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable conversation with a black
 
02:53:24.469 --> 02:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
man i watched it
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
an african-american male justified
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
lawless behavior made the case why it's
 
02:53:32.630 --> 02:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay for some groups to to break the law
 
02:53:35.750 --> 02:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
and sometimes be violent
 
02:53:38.790 --> 02:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
people had to understand why laws didn't
 
02:53:40.469 --> 02:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
apply the same way to some groups as
 
02:53:44.070 --> 02:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
they did others that is classic crt
 
02:53:46.790 --> 02:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
and it is out there i have witnessed it
 
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
i've watched it
 
02:53:50.710 --> 02:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
schools that deploy written materials
 
02:53:54.150 --> 02:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
such as the discredited 1619 project
 
02:53:57.030 --> 02:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
are absolutely promoting crt
 
02:53:59.190 --> 02:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
why is this being denied
 
02:54:02.870 --> 02:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
words matter and the truth matters
 
02:54:02.880 --> 02:54:03.990 align:start position:0%
words matter and the truth matters
yes

02:54:03.990 --> 02:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:54:05.910 --> 02:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
as you've heard earlier many folks are
 
02:54:08.550 --> 02:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about proselytizing in schools
 
02:54:11.910 --> 02:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
and colleges to captive audiences
 
02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
and there's much to be concerned about
 
02:54:16.150 --> 02:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
now we understand that many here are
 
02:54:18.710 --> 02:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
unsettled by the notion of loyalty oaths
 
02:54:20.070 --> 02:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
but there were valid reasons
 
02:54:22.950 --> 02:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
historically why these came about
 
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
and and i understand those who favor
 
02:54:29.830 --> 02:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
hb 1255 which i do not at this time
 
02:54:31.349 --> 02:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
i understand that they seek to be
 
02:54:34.070 --> 02:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
reassured that academic people are not
 
02:54:35.269 --> 02:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
working against our nation's
 
02:54:37.349 --> 02:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
institutions and interests recently a
 
02:54:39.190 --> 02:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
harvard university professor is charged
 
02:54:41.030 --> 02:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
with hiding his ties
 
02:54:42.389 --> 02:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
to a chinese
 
02:54:44.389 --> 02:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
run recruitment program and he was found
 
02:54:47.830 --> 02:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
guilty on all accounts a professor
 
02:54:50.469 --> 02:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
engaged in espionage
 
02:54:52.230 --> 02:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
i choose my words carefully here when i
 
02:54:54.630 --> 02:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
ask if that is not seditious a professor
 
02:54:56.550 --> 02:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
working secretly with our chinese
 
02:54:58.469 --> 02:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
adversaries why is that okay is that
 
02:55:01.349 --> 02:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
covered by academic freedom here in new
 
02:55:03.030 --> 02:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire controversial dartmouth
 
02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
professor mark bray
 
02:55:07.510 --> 02:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
of that school's gender research
 
02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:09.510 align:start position:0%
of that school's gender research
institute

02:55:09.510 --> 02:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
institute
 
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
defended egregious antifa violence he
 
02:55:14.710 --> 02:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
somehow described that as legit
 
02:55:16.550 --> 02:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
legitimate self-defense
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
legitimate self-defense
 
02:55:21.030 --> 02:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
dartmouth's president here in new
 
02:55:22.950 --> 02:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire understandably condemned
 
02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
professor bray but then over 100
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
over 100 dartmouth faculty people
 
02:55:30.309 --> 02:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
signed on to support their colleagues
 
02:55:32.309 --> 02:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
words i think there are unfortunate
 
02:55:34.870 --> 02:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
words and words matter i just received a
 
02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
message from a fellow state rep
 
02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
describing how another professor
 
02:55:39.750 --> 02:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
assigned an essay to his class to
 
02:55:41.910 --> 02:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
explain why the taliban is not a
 
02:55:44.230 --> 02:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
terrorist organization and to argue
 
02:55:45.510 --> 02:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise it
 
02:55:47.750 --> 02:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
would result in feeling great i served
 
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
in afghanistan i've seen the taliban
 
02:55:51.269 --> 02:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
i've seen their work
 
02:55:53.349 --> 02:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to hear professors use
 
02:55:54.790 --> 02:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
such words
 
02:55:57.030 --> 02:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
but tolerating such people is part of
 
02:55:59.510 --> 02:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
the wonder of america in our first
 
02:56:01.429 --> 02:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
america first amendment freedoms which
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
is why i cannot support a speed 1255 as
 
02:56:06.230 --> 02:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's currently worded
 
02:56:08.630 --> 02:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
blm materials and science can be seen
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
all over to include classrooms
 
02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
go to blm's website if you haven't
 
02:56:14.630 --> 02:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
already i have
 
02:56:18.550 --> 02:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's a marxist racist organization
 
02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
read what they have posted it they rail
 
02:56:22.469 --> 02:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
against quote
 
02:56:25.030 --> 02:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
white supremacist capitalism although i
 
02:56:27.190 --> 02:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
note on their website they have a
 
02:56:29.910 --> 02:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's a button corporate sponsors can
 
02:56:31.190 --> 02:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
hit if they want to make corporate
 
02:56:33.590 --> 02:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
donations interestingly
 
02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
blm wants to change our economic system
 
02:56:38.150 --> 02:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
our judicial system our political system
 
02:56:39.030 --> 02:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
they even
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
oppose a traditional nuclear family so
 
02:56:42.630 --> 02:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
when teachers display
 
02:56:45.349 --> 02:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
logos or signs supporting blm
 
02:56:47.910 --> 02:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
then they invite scrutiny regarding
 
02:56:49.830 --> 02:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
their judgment their values and maybe
 
02:56:51.910 --> 02:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
yes maybe their loyalties
 
02:56:53.510 --> 02:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
i once took an oath to defend our
 
02:56:56.230 --> 02:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
constitution against all enemies foreign
 
02:56:58.710 --> 02:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
and domestic i take that oath seriously
 
02:56:58.720 --> 02:56:59.830 align:start position:0%
and domestic i take that oath seriously
words

02:56:59.830 --> 02:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
words
 
02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:00.710 align:start position:0%
words
matter

02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
matter
 
02:57:03.269 --> 02:57:03.279 align:start position:0%
so maybe hb 1255 can be admitted in a
 
02:57:05.349 --> 02:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
way that could get more people
 
02:57:07.349 --> 02:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
like me to support it i cannot at this
 
02:57:09.190 --> 02:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
time we'll see in the meantime we should
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
not be afraid
 
02:57:13.110 --> 02:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
to shine some light and raise some
 
02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:14.309 align:start position:0%
to shine some light and raise some
awareness

02:57:14.309 --> 02:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
awareness
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes in lieu of laws just shining
 
02:57:18.150 --> 02:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
some light on things
 
02:57:19.590 --> 02:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
can get the result we need and i'll
 
02:57:22.469 --> 02:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
close with a quote from thomas paine
 
02:57:25.190 --> 02:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
those who expect to reap the blessings
 
02:57:28.230 --> 02:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
of freedom must endure the fatigue of
 
02:57:29.910 --> 02:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
supporting it
 
02:57:32.070 --> 02:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time i'd be happy to
 
02:57:34.230 --> 02:57:34.240 align:start position:0%

thank you for receiving my testimony
 
02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:02.870 align:start position:0%
thank you for receiving my testimony
today

02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:58:05.030 --> 02:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
you have a written lengthier version of
 
02:58:08.230 --> 02:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
this testimony included in your packet
 
02:58:10.150 --> 02:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
i am here today on behalf of the new
 
02:58:12.630 --> 02:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire council of churches
 
02:58:15.110 --> 02:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
nhcc is an ecumenical christian
 
02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:16.389 align:start position:0%
nhcc is an ecumenical christian
organization

02:58:16.389 --> 02:58:16.399 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:58:18.389 --> 02:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
comprised of nine denominations of
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
churches and hundreds of clergy across
 
02:58:22.710 --> 02:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
the granite state
 
02:58:24.950 --> 02:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
we pride ourselves on working across
 
02:58:27.429 --> 02:58:27.439 align:start position:0%
lines of difference for the common good
 
02:58:29.590 --> 02:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
of all granite staters
 
02:58:34.389 --> 02:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
i rise today in opposition to hb 1255.
 
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
hb 1255 is dangerous
 
02:58:41.269 --> 02:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
harmful and bad policy for new hampshire
 
02:58:44.950 --> 02:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
hb 1255 threatens teachers ability to do
 
02:58:47.349 --> 02:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
important curricular and classroom work
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
robustly and well
 
02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
there is a grave lack of clarity in the
 
02:58:53.910 --> 02:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
bill as it stands around what
 
02:58:56.710 --> 02:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
constitutes ideology
 
02:58:58.710 --> 02:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
as currently written the bill allows
 
02:59:01.030 --> 02:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
teachers to be penalized and targeted
 
02:59:03.990 --> 02:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
for a wide variety of content
 
02:59:06.070 --> 02:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
who will decide
 
02:59:08.870 --> 02:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
who will decide what constitutes quote
 
02:59:11.429 --> 02:59:11.439 align:start position:0%
any doctrine or theory promoting a
 
02:59:14.150 --> 02:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
negative account or representation of
 
02:59:16.469 --> 02:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
the founding and history of the united
 
02:59:18.630 --> 02:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
states of america in new hampshire
 
02:59:20.710 --> 02:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
02:59:23.590 --> 02:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
this language is dangerously vague
 
02:59:25.269 --> 02:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire council of churches
 
02:59:27.429 --> 02:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
has been engaged in a wide variety of
 
02:59:29.750 --> 02:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
difficult conversations on topics like
 
02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
racism across our state you have
 
02:59:34.309 --> 02:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
examples in our written testimony of
 
02:59:35.670 --> 02:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
that work
 
02:59:38.230 --> 02:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
we have seen what is possible when we
 
02:59:41.030 --> 02:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
rise to difficult conversations and when
 
02:59:43.429 --> 02:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
we face our discomfort rather than
 
02:59:44.950 --> 02:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
backing away
 
02:59:47.910 --> 02:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
it is not easy to face the realities of
 
02:59:50.790 --> 02:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
systemic racism in our founding
 
02:59:53.590 --> 02:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
our state or our nation but it is a
 
02:59:55.910 --> 02:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
moral and an ethical imperative that we
 
02:59:57.830 --> 02:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
must do that work
 
03:00:00.469 --> 03:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
only then can we grow together toward
 
03:00:02.710 --> 03:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
the more perfect union that our founders
 
03:00:02.720 --> 03:00:03.830 align:start position:0%
the more perfect union that our founders
sought

03:00:03.830 --> 03:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
sought
 
03:00:06.230 --> 03:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
i trust our public school teachers to
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
teach this history and this information
 
03:00:11.750 --> 03:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
in a rich and a robust context that
 
03:00:13.910 --> 03:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
helps our students more fully understand
 
03:00:16.389 --> 03:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
themselves and one another
 
03:00:18.389 --> 03:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
what after all is the goal of public
 
03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
education if not that
 
03:00:23.269 --> 03:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
as a religious leader i believe deeply
 
03:00:25.830 --> 03:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the power of truth-telling and i want
 
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
to empower our teachers to tell the
 
03:00:28.080 --> 03:00:29.030 align:start position:0%
to empower our teachers to tell the
truth

03:00:29.030 --> 03:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
truth
 
03:00:31.990 --> 03:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
nothing more and nothing less
 
03:00:34.790 --> 03:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
i fear instead that this bill only seeks
 
03:00:36.150 --> 03:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
to silence
 
03:00:38.389 --> 03:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
to divide and to punish some of our most
 
03:00:40.710 --> 03:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
dedicated public servants
 
03:00:42.309 --> 03:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the new hampshire council
 
03:00:44.950 --> 03:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
of churches i invite you to vote no on
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
hb 1255. we believe it is the faithful
 
03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:49.190 align:start position:0%
hb 1255. we believe it is the faithful
response

03:00:49.190 --> 03:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
response
 
03:00:51.190 --> 03:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much other
 
03:00:53.429 --> 03:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:00:55.590 --> 03:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much thank you
 
03:01:00.790 --> 03:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:13.429 --> 03:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:15.030 --> 03:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lad members of the
 
03:01:16.389 --> 03:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
house education committee for the record
 
03:01:17.750 --> 03:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
megan tuttle president for any new
 
03:01:19.670 --> 03:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire i have written testimony that
 
03:01:22.150 --> 03:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
i will submit so i'll just summarize it
 
03:01:24.309 --> 03:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
um we are here i'm here on behalf of any
 
03:01:25.750 --> 03:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to strongly object to
 
03:01:28.150 --> 03:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
passage of house bill 1255.
 
03:01:29.910 --> 03:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
we see it as a doubling down on the
 
03:01:33.030 --> 03:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
banned concepts law enacted in house hb2
 
03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
a law that's already subject to two
 
03:01:36.150 --> 03:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
federal lawsuits because of the chilling
 
03:01:37.429 --> 03:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
effect it's had on our students
 
03:01:39.510 --> 03:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
receiving an education they deserve the
 
03:01:41.510 --> 03:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
hate that it spun on its wake
 
03:01:43.190 --> 03:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
for one example the bounty that was put
 
03:01:45.910 --> 03:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
on the heads of our teachers
 
03:01:47.830 --> 03:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
similar to the ban concepts law that
 
03:01:50.070 --> 03:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
precedes this one this bill raises many
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
many questions about what it prohibits
 
03:01:54.070 --> 03:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
particularly in a classroom setting
 
03:01:55.510 --> 03:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
where is the line between the teaching
 
03:01:56.870 --> 03:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
and discussion of history versus
 
03:01:59.429 --> 03:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
advocating i've testified on this before
 
03:02:02.630 --> 03:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
educators are contacting me many times
 
03:02:04.230 --> 03:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
multiple educators from all across the
 
03:02:04.240 --> 03:02:05.110 align:start position:0%
multiple educators from all across the
state

03:02:05.110 --> 03:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
about the fact that they're not having
 
03:02:09.030 --> 03:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
discussions in their classroom they're
 
03:02:10.790 --> 03:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
afraid to have discussions
 
03:02:12.550 --> 03:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
critical thinking isn't being allowed
 
03:02:13.670 --> 03:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
because they're afraid that they're
 
03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
going to be reported for something
 
03:02:19.510 --> 03:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
in addition the passage of the bill
 
03:02:21.030 --> 03:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
would also not only mean teachers would
 
03:02:22.630 --> 03:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
have to navigate yet another big
 
03:02:24.469 --> 03:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
classroom censorship law but they would
 
03:02:25.750 --> 03:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
be doing it with the same threat of
 
03:02:27.590 --> 03:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
punishment using the educator code of
 
03:02:29.510 --> 03:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
conduct just like in the banned concepts
 
03:02:31.750 --> 03:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
law our students deserve an honest and
 
03:02:33.910 --> 03:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
accurate education that enables them to
 
03:02:35.349 --> 03:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
learn from the mistakes of our past to
 
03:02:37.670 --> 03:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
help create a better future legislation
 
03:02:39.910 --> 03:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
like house bill 1255 inhibits this with
 
03:02:41.910 --> 03:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
its language this seems to indicate that
 
03:02:43.510 --> 03:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
past mistakes were anything other than
 
03:02:45.349 --> 03:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
what wrongs this should not be repeated
 
03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
and whose effects still on our nation
 
03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:48.230 align:start position:0%
and whose effects still on our nation
today

03:02:48.230 --> 03:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:02:49.750 --> 03:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
as educators if we're going to prepare
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
our children for the future we need to
 
03:02:52.950 --> 03:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
teach them both the good and the bad of
 
03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
history so that they better understand
 
03:02:57.030 --> 03:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
the lives cultures and experiences of
 
03:02:59.269 --> 03:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
different people house bill 1255 would
 
03:03:01.190 --> 03:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
inhibit this from happening
 
03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
so on behalf of the educators across new
 
03:03:04.230 --> 03:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire whose loyalty is to their
 
03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
students i ask that you find house bill
 
03:03:08.550 --> 03:03:08.560 align:start position:0%

thank you very much
 
03:03:21.830 --> 03:03:21.840 align:start position:0%

you want to both come up at the same
time

03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:03:26.469 --> 03:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
that that'd be fine it might expedite
 
03:03:26.479 --> 03:03:37.910 align:start position:0%
that that'd be fine it might expedite
things

03:03:37.910 --> 03:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:39.990 --> 03:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
could you define both of your names then
 
03:03:41.830 --> 03:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
we can add the second on to the sheet
 
03:03:43.830 --> 03:03:43.840 align:start position:0%

i'm dr jim morris i'm the superintendent
 
03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
oyster river i have served in that
 
03:04:00.309 --> 03:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
capacity uh for 10 years thank you
 
03:04:00.319 --> 03:04:01.510 align:start position:0%
capacity uh for 10 years thank you
welcome

03:04:01.510 --> 03:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:03.349 align:start position:0%
welcome
okay

03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:04:03.359 --> 03:04:04.790 align:start position:0%
okay
um

03:04:04.790 --> 03:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:06.710 --> 03:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
i feel a bit at a disadvantage because
 
03:04:08.469 --> 03:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this text that we're
 
03:04:10.469 --> 03:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
supposed to be discussing today is some
 
03:04:12.630 --> 03:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
evolving text that there's some future
 
03:04:14.950 --> 03:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
text that we haven't seen so my comments
 
03:04:18.070 --> 03:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
are about the text that was presented so
 
03:04:19.750 --> 03:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
there may be some future text that
 
03:04:21.990 --> 03:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
resolves these questions but we we
 
03:04:23.510 --> 03:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
understand that i have not seen it
 
03:04:26.309 --> 03:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
either okay okay
 
03:04:27.590 --> 03:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's not been written
 
03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:28.710 align:start position:0%
it's not been written
um

03:04:28.710 --> 03:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:31.590 --> 03:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'm here to speak against this bill
 
03:04:33.510 --> 03:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
any bill has two requirements it should
 
03:04:35.190 --> 03:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
be clear on the kind of action it
 
03:04:35.200 --> 03:04:36.469 align:start position:0%
be clear on the kind of action it
addresses

03:04:36.469 --> 03:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
03:04:37.670 --> 03:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
and it should be clear in what is
 
03:04:37.680 --> 03:04:38.870 align:start position:0%
and it should be clear in what is
required

03:04:38.870 --> 03:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
required
 
03:04:41.910 --> 03:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
this bill fails on both counts
 
03:04:43.510 --> 03:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
and i want to focus on one sentence
 
03:04:45.830 --> 03:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's been referred to already it's in
 
03:04:48.389 --> 03:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill and it reads
 
03:04:50.469 --> 03:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
no teacher shall advocate any doctrine
 
03:04:52.870 --> 03:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
or theory promoting a negative account
 
03:04:54.790 --> 03:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
a representation of the founding and
 
03:04:57.349 --> 03:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
history of the united states of america
 
03:04:58.710 --> 03:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire public schools
 
03:05:00.550 --> 03:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
which does not include the worldwide
 
03:05:03.510 --> 03:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
context of now outdated and discouraged
 
03:05:03.520 --> 03:05:04.870 align:start position:0%
context of now outdated and discouraged
practices

03:05:04.870 --> 03:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
practices
 
03:05:06.309 --> 03:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
a difficult sentence with a double
 
03:05:09.110 --> 03:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
negative at the center of it
 
03:05:11.030 --> 03:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
now imagine if a history teacher wanted
 
03:05:12.389 --> 03:05:12.399 align:start position:0%
to teach about the internment of
 
03:05:15.110 --> 03:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
japanese americans during world war ii
 
03:05:17.990 --> 03:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
120 000 of them placed in internment
 
03:05:20.230 --> 03:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
camps for the entire war if they had
 
03:05:21.990 --> 03:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
even one sixteenth
 
03:05:24.309 --> 03:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
japanese heritage
 
03:05:26.309 --> 03:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
this internment is viewed now as an act
 
03:05:28.309 --> 03:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
of xenophobia which prompt prompted a
 
03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
review by our government and a
 
03:05:31.750 --> 03:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
reparations bill signed by president
 
03:05:31.760 --> 03:05:33.429 align:start position:0%
reparations bill signed by president
reagan

03:05:33.429 --> 03:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
reagan
 
03:05:35.750 --> 03:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
so is it covered by this bill
 
03:05:37.110 --> 03:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
it is a negative account of
 
03:05:37.120 --> 03:05:38.790 align:start position:0%
it is a negative account of
representation

03:05:38.790 --> 03:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
representation
 
03:05:41.349 --> 03:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
and there are sociological theories of
 
03:05:43.750 --> 03:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
racial trauma to explain and
 
03:05:45.510 --> 03:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
to explain the internment and their
 
03:05:47.670 --> 03:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
effect on those in turn
 
03:05:49.269 --> 03:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
is it covered
 
03:05:49.279 --> 03:05:50.230 align:start position:0%
is it covered
maybe

03:05:50.230 --> 03:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:05:51.910 --> 03:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
maybe not
 
03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
terms like promoting a negative account
 
03:05:56.870 --> 03:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
of representation are highly subjective
 
03:05:58.630 --> 03:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
is it a negative account
 
03:06:01.030 --> 03:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
or an honest one
 
03:06:02.790 --> 03:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
but suppose we decided that it is
 
03:06:02.800 --> 03:06:04.150 align:start position:0%
but suppose we decided that it is
covered

03:06:04.150 --> 03:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
covered
 
03:06:05.750 --> 03:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
that this teacher is doing something
 
03:06:08.070 --> 03:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's covered by this law
 
03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
what is required of this teacher
 
03:06:12.550 --> 03:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
the teacher must quote
 
03:06:14.950 --> 03:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
include the worldwide context of now
 
03:06:17.510 --> 03:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
outdated and discouraged practices
 
03:06:17.520 --> 03:06:18.630 align:start position:0%
outdated and discouraged practices
unquote

03:06:18.630 --> 03:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
i have no idea what that means
 
03:06:23.910 --> 03:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
worldwide that's a gigantic task
 
03:06:25.830 --> 03:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
indonesia australia
 
03:06:27.510 --> 03:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
who would have the time the knowledge
 
03:06:27.520 --> 03:06:28.950 align:start position:0%
who would have the time the knowledge
base

03:06:28.950 --> 03:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
base
 
03:06:31.429 --> 03:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
what are quote now outdated and
 
03:06:33.510 --> 03:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
discouraged practices discouraged by
 
03:06:33.520 --> 03:06:35.030 align:start position:0%
discouraged practices discouraged by
whom

03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
whom
 
03:06:36.710 --> 03:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
could any of you explain it to this
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
teacher what's required
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
the language is impossibly vague a pile
 
03:06:45.190 --> 03:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
there is a particular danger in this
 
03:06:48.469 --> 03:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
vagueness and the vagueness of this
 
03:06:50.070 --> 03:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
proposed law
 
03:06:51.510 --> 03:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
teachers will not know what is
 
03:06:54.309 --> 03:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
prohibited and what is allowed and with
 
03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
their teaching credentials at stake
 
03:06:58.070 --> 03:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
who would blame them if they didn't
 
03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
touch topics like japanese internment
 
03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
which would be a disservice to new
 
03:07:04.550 --> 03:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire students
 
03:07:06.710 --> 03:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
these stories need to be told and they
 
03:07:08.309 --> 03:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
were surely not part of the history i
 
03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:14.070 --> 03:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
any attempt to regulate in a few
 
03:07:14.080 --> 03:07:15.269 align:start position:0%
any attempt to regulate in a few
sentences

03:07:15.269 --> 03:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
something as complex as the teaching of
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
history is destined to be misinterpreted
 
03:07:20.870 --> 03:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
and contested
 
03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
i urge you to designate this laws and
 
03:07:24.870 --> 03:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
expedient and i would also like to point
 
03:07:24.880 --> 03:07:25.670 align:start position:0%
expedient and i would also like to point
out

03:07:25.670 --> 03:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:07:25.680 --> 03:07:26.630 align:start position:0%
out
that

03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
there are policies you know coming from
 
03:07:30.870 --> 03:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school board that
 
03:07:33.670 --> 03:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
prohibit the advocacy of personal
 
03:07:35.750 --> 03:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
beliefs whether that is marxism and
 
03:07:38.469 --> 03:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
communism but also republicanism and you
 
03:07:40.950 --> 03:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
know democrat being democrat
 
03:07:42.550 --> 03:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
that prohibit you from using your
 
03:07:44.630 --> 03:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
position as a teacher to advocate for
 
03:07:46.630 --> 03:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
those our school board has passed those
 
03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
the school boards association has
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
you know is given us the language there
 
03:07:53.030 --> 03:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
and so i think these policies are in
 
03:07:55.269 --> 03:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
place and i think that
 
03:07:57.910 --> 03:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
the greater danger is not it's not that
 
03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
they're isolated cases where peace
 
03:08:01.510 --> 03:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
teachers may cross the line i think the
 
03:08:02.710 --> 03:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
big danger
 
03:08:05.110 --> 03:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
is that because of these bills
 
03:08:07.349 --> 03:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
teachers will be reluctant to teach
 
03:08:09.830 --> 03:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
subjects and parts of american history
 
03:08:11.030 --> 03:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
that have been suppressed that
 
03:08:14.469 --> 03:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:14.479 --> 03:08:17.349 align:start position:0%
 
just

03:08:17.349 --> 03:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:19.110 --> 03:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
and i would just add that you know the
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
equivalent to what you do here is school
 
03:08:23.349 --> 03:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
board policy that's our legislative
 
03:08:23.359 --> 03:08:24.469 align:start position:0%
board policy that's our legislative
language

03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:08:27.269 --> 03:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
and annually i send out a message to my
 
03:08:29.910 --> 03:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
staff reminding them of this policy
 
03:08:32.230 --> 03:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
because inevitably somebody will call me
 
03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
and say you know xy teacher is doing x y
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
and z
 
03:08:38.389 --> 03:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
so i am always preempted with this law
 
03:08:40.870 --> 03:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about this policy
 
03:08:43.110 --> 03:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
but we do it at the at the local level i
 
03:08:47.590 --> 03:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
would suggest that legislation should be
 
03:08:50.550 --> 03:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
passed that fits the majority
 
03:08:53.670 --> 03:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
not anecdotal records because anecdotes
 
03:08:56.230 --> 03:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
are addressed at the local level and for
 
03:08:57.910 --> 03:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
you all to try to pass a piece of
 
03:09:00.790 --> 03:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
legislation from concord that addresses
 
03:09:03.190 --> 03:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
anecdotes those anecdotes will always be
 
03:09:05.429 --> 03:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
there and a good superintendent is
 
03:09:07.830 --> 03:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
always going to address them so i would
 
03:09:09.269 --> 03:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
suggest that
 
03:09:12.070 --> 03:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
the law as it's written
 
03:09:14.790 --> 03:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
along with tom is vague and and quite
 
03:09:16.710 --> 03:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
frankly i think it's unnecessary because
 
03:09:18.469 --> 03:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
we already have policies that address
 
03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
this at the local level
 
03:09:23.030 --> 03:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i have one question
 
03:09:24.309 --> 03:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
for you or a request from your
 
03:09:27.030 --> 03:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent um
 
03:09:29.830 --> 03:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
if you if you're echoing a boilerplate
 
03:09:31.349 --> 03:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
policy coming out of the new hampshire
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
school boards association or if you've
 
03:09:34.309 --> 03:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
developed your own there could you
 
03:09:36.229 --> 03:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
provide a copy to the committee please
 
03:09:37.590 --> 03:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to do that thank you
 
03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:40.550 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to do that thank you

thank you very much thank you thank you
 
03:09:55.750 --> 03:09:55.760 align:start position:0%

minutes please yes sir and that would
 
03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:03.840 align:start position:0%

03:10:06.150 --> 03:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:08.469 --> 03:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
so my name is jennifer given i am a
 
03:10:10.469 --> 03:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
history teacher so it's always nice to
 
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
actually talk to the people who are
 
03:10:15.110 --> 03:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
doing the work that is being legislated
 
03:10:17.910 --> 03:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
um and so i have given up a personal day
 
03:10:20.150 --> 03:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
today to be here to represent myself but
 
03:10:23.429 --> 03:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
also to uh represent my kids both my
 
03:10:25.590 --> 03:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
biological teenagers who i live with and
 
03:10:27.429 --> 03:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
my students who i teach
 
03:10:30.070 --> 03:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
i teach world history i teach ap world
 
03:10:32.790 --> 03:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
history and college prep world history i
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
teach slavery
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
of rome china egypt
 
03:10:40.550 --> 03:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
all like all throughout all of human
 
03:10:43.190 --> 03:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
history we compare different types of
 
03:10:45.510 --> 03:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
forced labor systems because sometimes
 
03:10:47.349 --> 03:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
forced labor isn't defined the way we
 
03:10:49.750 --> 03:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
would kind of define just slavery so i
 
03:10:51.110 --> 03:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
take real
 
03:10:53.510 --> 03:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
issue with the idea that there are
 
03:10:55.510 --> 03:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
anecdotes and
 
03:10:57.269 --> 03:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
vague assertions that this is not
 
03:11:00.550 --> 03:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
happening and that the legislature is in
 
03:11:02.070 --> 03:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
my view over
 
03:11:03.670 --> 03:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
solving the problem
 
03:11:06.790 --> 03:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
by reaching so far into my classroom as
 
03:11:09.429 --> 03:11:09.439 align:start position:0%
to tell me what i can and cannot say
 
03:11:11.910 --> 03:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
in order to try to address
 
03:11:14.389 --> 03:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
some kind of vague assertion that people
 
03:11:16.389 --> 03:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
have made or somebody watched a youtube
 
03:11:18.950 --> 03:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
video like i can pull up a youtube video
 
03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
on any topic
 
03:11:23.110 --> 03:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that that's fact which
 
03:11:25.030 --> 03:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
is a skill that i'm actually teaching my
 
03:11:27.190 --> 03:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
students by demanding that their level
 
03:11:29.990 --> 03:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
of evidence far exceeds the evidence
 
03:11:31.990 --> 03:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
i've currently heard today
 
03:11:34.630 --> 03:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
i'm frustrated that i'm here for a bill
 
03:11:37.990 --> 03:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
that is poorly thought through
 
03:11:40.950 --> 03:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
poorly defined vague
 
03:11:44.150 --> 03:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
that would not fly in my classroom i
 
03:11:46.150 --> 03:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
don't know why we're wasting our time
 
03:11:48.309 --> 03:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
with that when we could be working on
 
03:11:50.550 --> 03:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
real problems in schools
 
03:11:53.590 --> 03:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
and so that i find frustrating um i also
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
am insulted by the idea that teachers
 
03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
should be
 
03:11:56.640 --> 03:11:58.070 align:start position:0%
should be
loyal

03:11:58.070 --> 03:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
loyal
 
03:12:00.630 --> 03:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
questioning my loyalty is demeaning
 
03:12:03.429 --> 03:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
questioning my loyalty is an insult the
 
03:12:04.950 --> 03:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
idea that
 
03:12:07.269 --> 03:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
i show up to work every day for low
 
03:12:10.389 --> 03:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
wages and in unsafe conditions and i'm
 
03:12:12.790 --> 03:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
not loyal
 
03:12:13.910 --> 03:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
i would love to know what your
 
03:12:16.710 --> 03:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
definition of loyalty is if it's not
 
03:12:16.720 --> 03:12:17.590 align:start position:0%
definition of loyalty is if it's not
that

03:12:17.590 --> 03:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:12:17.600 --> 03:12:19.030 align:start position:0%
that
right

03:12:19.030 --> 03:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:12:20.389 --> 03:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
03:12:23.030 --> 03:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
this is a law that is regressive
 
03:12:25.830 --> 03:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
mccarthy would be very excited about
 
03:12:26.950 --> 03:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
this law
 
03:12:26.960 --> 03:12:27.750 align:start position:0%
this law
right

03:12:27.750 --> 03:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:12:31.429 --> 03:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
this law is overly simplifying complex
 
03:12:34.229 --> 03:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
issues for the sake of chilling teachers
 
03:12:34.239 --> 03:12:35.349 align:start position:0%
issues for the sake of chilling teachers
speech

03:12:35.349 --> 03:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
speech
 
03:12:38.309 --> 03:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
let's be clear it has no real effort to
 
03:12:40.710 --> 03:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
try to clarify history
 
03:12:43.190 --> 03:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
what you are attempting to do is silence
 
03:12:43.200 --> 03:12:44.469 align:start position:0%
what you are attempting to do is silence
discussion

03:12:44.469 --> 03:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:12:46.790 --> 03:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
whitewash our curriculum
 
03:12:49.990 --> 03:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
and tolerate intolerable views
 
03:12:52.870 --> 03:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
i teach my students that there are lines
 
03:12:55.830 --> 03:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
that slavery was wrong that nazis were
 
03:12:58.870 --> 03:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
wrong that fascism is wrong
 
03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
i do not indoctrinate them but i do tell
 
03:13:03.510 --> 03:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
them that when people lose their lives
 
03:13:06.790 --> 03:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
for expressing their ideas that's wrong
 
03:13:08.309 --> 03:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what this law is
 
03:13:10.309 --> 03:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
attempting to do
 
03:13:11.429 --> 03:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:13:12.870 --> 03:13:12.880 align:start position:0%

to have a question
 
03:13:22.710 --> 03:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.309 --> 03:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.319 --> 03:13:35.269 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

thank you chairman ladd and under
 
03:13:38.790 --> 03:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee my
 
03:13:40.469 --> 03:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
name is devin chafee and i am the
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
executive director of the aclu of new
 
03:13:42.960 --> 03:13:44.309 align:start position:0%
executive director of the aclu of new
hampshire

03:13:44.309 --> 03:13:44.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:13:47.110 --> 03:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
a non-profit non-partisan organization
 
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's worked to protect civil liberties
 
03:13:50.469 --> 03:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire for over
 
03:13:53.990 --> 03:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
50 years i am here to testify today to
 
03:13:55.590 --> 03:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge the committee to vote
 
03:13:59.349 --> 03:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate on hb 1255. i
 
03:14:01.510 --> 03:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
also understand that there does seem to
 
03:14:03.830 --> 03:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
be some fluidity in the language but i
 
03:14:05.830 --> 03:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
also so i also in in addition to
 
03:14:07.590 --> 03:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
addressing the specific language that's
 
03:14:09.670 --> 03:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
before us today i want to express some
 
03:14:12.229 --> 03:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
of my concerns with what i understand
 
03:14:14.550 --> 03:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
and as is being articulated as the
 
03:14:16.790 --> 03:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
intent behind the bill given the chance
 
03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
that i might not have an opportunity to
 
03:14:21.910 --> 03:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
testify on any additional um amendment
 
03:14:23.590 --> 03:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
that may be put forth
 
03:14:23.600 --> 03:14:24.550 align:start position:0%
that may be put forth
so

03:14:24.550 --> 03:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:14:26.550 --> 03:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
i just want to start by saying
 
03:14:28.630 --> 03:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
that i think that we are better as a
 
03:14:31.030 --> 03:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
state and a community when we can have
 
03:14:33.429 --> 03:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
hard conversations and when we can learn
 
03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
from them
 
03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
and that's part of why it's so important
 
03:14:38.229 --> 03:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
that our students when they are in the
 
03:14:40.469 --> 03:14:40.479 align:start position:0%
classroom and in our schools are able to
 
03:14:43.349 --> 03:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
get a full picture of america's history
 
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
that includes both
 
03:14:46.870 --> 03:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
the good and the bad
 
03:14:50.309 --> 03:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
and it is my sincere concern that this
 
03:14:53.910 --> 03:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
bill as written would not allow uh for a
 
03:14:57.190 --> 03:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
full representation of american history
 
03:14:59.110 --> 03:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
um you know there's been a lot of
 
03:15:01.670 --> 03:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
discussion about how we need to have
 
03:15:03.510 --> 03:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
free discussion in our classrooms about
 
03:15:06.389 --> 03:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
how free discussion in our classrooms is
 
03:15:08.150 --> 03:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
important and
 
03:15:10.710 --> 03:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
it is my opinion especially based on
 
03:15:12.389 --> 03:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
what we have seen in new hampshire
 
03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
schools over the last year that the
 
03:15:17.670 --> 03:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
absolute worst way to encourage free
 
03:15:19.910 --> 03:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
discussion and perhaps the best way to
 
03:15:22.630 --> 03:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
limit free discussion in the classroom
 
03:15:26.150 --> 03:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
is to uh impose very vague prohibitions
 
03:15:28.710 --> 03:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
and limitations on what can be discussed
 
03:15:31.110 --> 03:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
and then couple those limitations with
 
03:15:32.790 --> 03:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
very serious
 
03:15:35.910 --> 03:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
real and potentially career ending um
 
03:15:35.920 --> 03:15:37.349 align:start position:0%
real and potentially career ending um
consequences

03:15:37.349 --> 03:15:37.359 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
03:15:39.190 --> 03:15:39.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe that that is exactly what
 
03:15:43.590 --> 03:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
hb 1255 does do as currently written
 
03:15:46.150 --> 03:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
um you know right now the bill as it's
 
03:15:48.309 --> 03:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
written is
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
very vague in what it prohibits it
 
03:15:52.870 --> 03:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
prohibits quote unquote advocating for
 
03:15:55.510 --> 03:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
not only socialism or marxism but also
 
03:15:57.590 --> 03:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
advocating any doctrine or theory that
 
03:15:59.190 --> 03:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
promotes a negative account or
 
03:16:01.110 --> 03:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
representation of the founding and
 
03:16:03.190 --> 03:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
history of the united states of america
 
03:16:04.790 --> 03:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
which does not include the worldwide
 
03:16:07.510 --> 03:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
context of now outdated and discouraged
 
03:16:09.670 --> 03:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
practices including that america was
 
03:16:11.590 --> 03:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
founded on racism
 
03:16:13.670 --> 03:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
and so i looked to this language
 
03:16:15.269 --> 03:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
and not unlike the language that was
 
03:16:18.950 --> 03:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
included in hb2 um that that put similar
 
03:16:20.630 --> 03:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
limitations on what can be done in the
 
03:16:23.349 --> 03:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
classroom i have to wonder how on earth
 
03:16:25.910 --> 03:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
are teachers supposed to know what this
 
03:16:27.990 --> 03:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
means in practice how are they supposed
 
03:16:29.990 --> 03:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
to know what this means when it comes to
 
03:16:32.550 --> 03:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
what they can and cannot discuss in the
 
03:16:32.560 --> 03:16:33.750 align:start position:0%
what they can and cannot discuss in the
classroom

03:16:33.750 --> 03:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
03:16:36.150 --> 03:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
what is a negative account what does
 
03:16:38.790 --> 03:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
founded on racism mean
 
03:16:40.630 --> 03:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
does it allow for the historical
 
03:16:43.030 --> 03:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
discussion of the soviet uh russia or
 
03:16:44.389 --> 03:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
communist china
 
03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
does this language um
 
03:16:49.830 --> 03:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
prohibit the exclusive discussion of uh
 
03:16:51.910 --> 03:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
of racism against persons of color in
 
03:16:53.990 --> 03:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
the united states our history like
 
03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:55.269 align:start position:0%
the united states our history like
redlining

03:16:55.269 --> 03:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
redlining
 
03:16:57.590 --> 03:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
like the three-fifths compromise
 
03:17:00.229 --> 03:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
like the trail of tears
 
03:17:02.150 --> 03:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
how the united states was in fact late
 
03:17:04.870 --> 03:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
to abolish slavery compared to many
 
03:17:07.269 --> 03:17:07.279 align:start position:0%
other european countries
 
03:17:09.750 --> 03:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
is that allowed or does that violate the
 
03:17:09.760 --> 03:17:11.750 align:start position:0%
is that allowed or does that violate the
bill

03:17:11.750 --> 03:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:17:14.469 --> 03:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that uh that that this is
 
03:17:16.469 --> 03:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
is hardly clear from the bill's language
 
03:17:18.630 --> 03:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
and i fear as has as others have
 
03:17:20.070 --> 03:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
referenced that it's
 
03:17:22.469 --> 03:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
that um any additional language that's
 
03:17:24.870 --> 03:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
proposed will be equally vague
 
03:17:26.469 --> 03:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
i also want to highlight that it does
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
seem from some of the testimony that i
 
03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
have heard here that at least some
 
03:17:32.469 --> 03:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
concepts such as the potential um
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
the disparate impact of our criminal
 
03:17:36.229 --> 03:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
legal system on people of color
 
03:17:37.830 --> 03:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the country does seem to be
 
03:17:39.190 --> 03:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
something that is that that is
 
03:17:40.710 --> 03:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
intentionally being targeted by the
 
03:17:44.790 --> 03:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
language that is included in hb uh 1255.
 
03:17:47.190 --> 03:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
so again i i'm concerned not only about
 
03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
the language that is represented in this
 
03:17:51.990 --> 03:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
bill as well as what uh what exactly
 
03:17:55.269 --> 03:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's intending um to prohibit
 
03:17:57.269 --> 03:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
and again this the vagueness and the
 
03:17:59.190 --> 03:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
lack of clarity and what is being
 
03:18:01.429 --> 03:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
prohibited has only come
 
03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
is only made worse by the stiff
 
03:18:05.510 --> 03:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
penalties that are associated with the
 
03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:06.469 align:start position:0%
penalties that are associated with the
bill

03:18:06.469 --> 03:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:18:08.309 --> 03:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
this bill provides that a violation of
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
this section will be considered a
 
03:18:11.429 --> 03:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
violation of new hampshire's code of
 
03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
ethics and code of conduct for
 
03:18:14.790 --> 03:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
educational professionals and shall
 
03:18:17.110 --> 03:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
justify disciplinary sanctions and what
 
03:18:18.309 --> 03:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
this means
 
03:18:21.429 --> 03:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
is that an educator uh it could lead
 
03:18:22.710 --> 03:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
that uh that a violation could
 
03:18:24.550 --> 03:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
potentially lead to an educator's
 
03:18:26.950 --> 03:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
license to work in the state
 
03:18:28.469 --> 03:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
being revoked and that's essentially
 
03:18:30.950 --> 03:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
ending a teacher's career so you have
 
03:18:33.190 --> 03:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
these incredibly vague definitions of
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
what may or may not be prohibited in the
 
03:18:37.269 --> 03:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
classroom and then you have teachers
 
03:18:38.950 --> 03:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
that are looking at potentially losing
 
03:18:41.670 --> 03:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
their career on the basis of violating
 
03:18:43.830 --> 03:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
these vague prohibitions
 
03:18:47.429 --> 03:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
and what this bill will do as much as
 
03:18:49.990 --> 03:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
the the language that was in hb2 has
 
03:18:52.950 --> 03:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
done and as we have seen it will chill
 
03:18:55.429 --> 03:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
conversation in the classroom and it
 
03:18:57.510 --> 03:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
will actively discourage
 
03:19:00.870 --> 03:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
accurate instruction about um
 
03:19:03.190 --> 03:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
topics in the classroom because they are
 
03:19:05.910 --> 03:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
negative or or somehow portray the
 
03:19:07.830 --> 03:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
united states in some type of negative
 
03:19:07.840 --> 03:19:09.110 align:start position:0%
united states in some type of negative
light

03:19:09.110 --> 03:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
light
 
03:19:10.790 --> 03:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
under this bill it could very well be
 
03:19:13.190 --> 03:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
unlawful for a teacher to exclusively
 
03:19:15.910 --> 03:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
teach the civil rights movement jim crow
 
03:19:18.229 --> 03:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
segregation the impact of the end of
 
03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
reconstruction on black americans or the
 
03:19:22.790 --> 03:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
brutal realities of colonization for the
 
03:19:25.190 --> 03:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
indigenous populations
 
03:19:26.710 --> 03:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
and compelling this instruction to
 
03:19:29.830 --> 03:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
somehow be in a worldwide context really
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
has the potential for diminishing the
 
03:19:33.830 --> 03:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
unique american experiences of those of
 
03:19:36.389 --> 03:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
color in the united states
 
03:19:37.830 --> 03:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
students in new hampshire should be
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
taught their true history and not a
 
03:19:42.469 --> 03:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
history that dilutes the true story of
 
03:19:45.510 --> 03:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
america including the story of racism in
 
03:19:47.349 --> 03:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
our country
 
03:19:48.870 --> 03:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
i also want to highlight that it does
 
03:19:51.269 --> 03:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
appear that this bill would apply not
 
03:19:53.910 --> 03:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
only to k-12 which we have primarily i
 
03:19:55.910 --> 03:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
think focused on thus far but would also
 
03:19:57.990 --> 03:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
focus on would also apply to public
 
03:20:00.070 --> 03:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities again
 
03:20:01.590 --> 03:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
violating the first amendment and
 
03:20:03.750 --> 03:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
protections of academic freedom
 
03:20:05.590 --> 03:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
this is long-standing precedent going
 
03:20:07.990 --> 03:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
back over 60 years that the supreme
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
court has recognized
 
03:20:12.790 --> 03:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
and made clear that particularly in the
 
03:20:15.030 --> 03:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
university setting it is unquestionable
 
03:20:16.309 --> 03:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
that voip
 
03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
viewpoint based suppression of speech is
 
03:20:20.550 --> 03:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
not permissible uh silencing a
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
particular viewpoint here we're talking
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
about negative conceptions implicating
 
03:20:27.269 --> 03:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
racism in american history is a clear
 
03:20:28.790 --> 03:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
violation of the first amendment under
 
03:20:31.670 --> 03:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
u.s supreme court precedent
 
03:20:34.150 --> 03:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
so again it seems to me in some that
 
03:20:42.389 --> 03:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:44.469 --> 03:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
no worries no worries of course
 
03:20:44.479 --> 03:20:45.349 align:start position:0%
no worries no worries of course
again

03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that this bill is
 
03:20:49.349 --> 03:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
fundamentally about censorship and
 
03:20:51.750 --> 03:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
censorship is a dangerous concept
 
03:20:53.510 --> 03:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
in schools we should be allowing ideas
 
03:20:55.030 --> 03:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
to be discussed even those we don't
 
03:20:57.110 --> 03:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
agree with so students are exposed to
 
03:20:58.870 --> 03:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
alternative perspectives and can be
 
03:21:00.630 --> 03:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
taught to evaluate these ideas for
 
03:21:00.640 --> 03:21:01.990 align:start position:0%
taught to evaluate these ideas for
themselves

03:21:01.990 --> 03:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:21:04.469 --> 03:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
but through 1255's inevitable chill
 
03:21:06.150 --> 03:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
students are going to be robbed of
 
03:21:08.870 --> 03:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
information and ideas and instructional
 
03:21:10.870 --> 03:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
instructional approaches that they need
 
03:21:13.670 --> 03:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
to effectively function as citizens in
 
03:21:15.429 --> 03:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
america's democratic system and i want
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
to be clear we are already seeing
 
03:21:17.040 --> 03:21:18.070 align:start position:0%
to be clear we are already seeing
teachers

03:21:18.070 --> 03:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
03:21:20.790 --> 03:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that are now not
 
03:21:22.870 --> 03:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
allowing students to pick their own
 
03:21:25.429 --> 03:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
report topics because they are concerned
 
03:21:27.670 --> 03:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
that they might somehow pick up a topic
 
03:21:30.469 --> 03:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
that would be in violation of the
 
03:21:32.469 --> 03:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
prohibited concepts language that was
 
03:21:35.590 --> 03:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
included in hb2 last year we are already
 
03:21:38.870 --> 03:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
seeing teachers pull back and pull books
 
03:21:41.030 --> 03:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
from their curriculum excuse me can you
 
03:21:42.790 --> 03:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
kind of cut it short a little bit here
 
03:21:44.550 --> 03:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
we've gone quite a long time here and we
 
03:21:47.349 --> 03:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
still have seven more cards to go
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes yes uh chairman i want to be i just
 
03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that we're already
 
03:21:52.550 --> 03:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
starting to see that chill and i want to
 
03:21:54.550 --> 03:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
end with a quote from the us supreme
 
03:21:54.560 --> 03:21:55.590 align:start position:0%
end with a quote from the us supreme
court

03:21:55.590 --> 03:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:21:58.790 --> 03:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's from a 1943 decision
 
03:22:01.030 --> 03:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
as governmental pressures towards unity
 
03:22:02.950 --> 03:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
become greater so strife becomes more
 
03:22:05.830 --> 03:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
bitter as to whose unity it shall be
 
03:22:07.510 --> 03:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
probably no deeper division of our
 
03:22:09.030 --> 03:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
people could proceed from any
 
03:22:10.630 --> 03:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
provocation than from finding it
 
03:22:12.790 --> 03:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
necessary to choose what doctrine and
 
03:22:15.110 --> 03:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
whose program public educational
 
03:22:17.269 --> 03:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
officials shall be compelled shall
 
03:22:20.150 --> 03:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
compel youth to unite an embracing
 
03:22:22.309 --> 03:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
compulsory unification of opinion
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
achieves only the unanimity of the
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
graveyard and for these reasons i
 
03:22:27.429 --> 03:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge the committee to
 
03:22:29.910 --> 03:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
recommend that hb 1255 be deemed
 
03:22:31.670 --> 03:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate thank you very
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much are there any
 
03:22:33.359 --> 03:22:34.469 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much are there any
questions

03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:22:36.790 --> 03:22:36.800 align:start position:0%

03:22:36.800 --> 03:22:38.309 align:start position:0%

03:22:45.910 --> 03:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
from peterborough yes
 
03:22:48.479 --> 03:22:50.550 align:start position:0%

welcome
 
03:22:52.389 --> 03:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman ladd
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
i come before the committee today to
 
03:22:56.790 --> 03:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
03:22:59.590 --> 03:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
i've spent my entire time in school here
 
03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:23:03.190 --> 03:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
and i can attest to the fact i can
 
03:23:05.830 --> 03:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
attest to being the only black person
 
03:23:08.309 --> 03:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
in an all-white school having no one to
 
03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
look to
 
03:23:10.389 --> 03:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
having no
 
03:23:10.399 --> 03:23:11.670 align:start position:0%
having no
mentor

03:23:11.670 --> 03:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
mentor
 
03:23:14.550 --> 03:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
to say oh hey i'm feeling a little bit
 
03:23:16.630 --> 03:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
something's going on i mean there's
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
someone calling me a name there's
 
03:23:20.309 --> 03:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
someone saying i'm
 
03:23:22.469 --> 03:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
wrong for this just because i did
 
03:23:24.309 --> 03:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong you have no one to turn to
 
03:23:26.790 --> 03:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
and you isolate those feelings you say
 
03:23:28.229 --> 03:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
okay i'll just
 
03:23:31.750 --> 03:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
put them down i'll squash them keep them
 
03:23:33.990 --> 03:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
solid and there was one time in third
 
03:23:35.910 --> 03:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
grade where i know i was a little bit of
 
03:23:38.150 --> 03:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
a mischievous oblivious third grader so
 
03:23:39.910 --> 03:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
i thought i was in trouble
 
03:23:41.910 --> 03:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
my third grade teacher sat me down and
 
03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
said i need to talk to you one-on-one
 
03:23:46.309 --> 03:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
and this is the first of many of those
 
03:23:46.319 --> 03:23:47.349 align:start position:0%
and this is the first of many of those
meetings

03:23:47.349 --> 03:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
03:23:49.269 --> 03:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
and she told me about martin luther king
 
03:23:50.950 --> 03:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
sort of separate from
 
03:23:53.190 --> 03:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
the conversation that we were having in
 
03:23:55.030 --> 03:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
the classroom
 
03:23:57.110 --> 03:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
because she knew that the conversation
 
03:23:58.950 --> 03:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
around king the real the realities
 
03:24:02.630 --> 03:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
around what he was doing in that time
 
03:24:04.790 --> 03:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's too much for a third grader
 
03:24:06.790 --> 03:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
um but if you're a third grader who has
 
03:24:09.429 --> 03:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
no mentor to look to a third grader who
 
03:24:11.670 --> 03:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
has no one who he can say hey that's
 
03:24:13.110 --> 03:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
that's me
 
03:24:14.469 --> 03:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
then you need to know that history
 
03:24:17.030 --> 03:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
because you need to know who you are and
 
03:24:18.229 --> 03:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
i had a white
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh old white lady teacher who was very
 
03:24:21.120 --> 03:24:22.389 align:start position:0%
uh old white lady teacher who was very
nice

03:24:22.389 --> 03:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
nice
 
03:24:24.229 --> 03:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
and she missed jetkins and she sat me
 
03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
down and she said look you need to know
 
03:24:27.990 --> 03:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
the realities of what martin luther king
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
did what he stood for
 
03:24:32.150 --> 03:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
and without that meeting without those
 
03:24:32.160 --> 03:24:33.510 align:start position:0%
and without that meeting without those
meetings

03:24:33.510 --> 03:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
03:24:35.190 --> 03:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
i can say honestly i probably wouldn't
 
03:24:37.910 --> 03:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
be here with you today alive i mean i
 
03:24:39.110 --> 03:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
probably would have already taken my
 
03:24:39.120 --> 03:24:41.190 align:start position:0%
probably would have already taken my
life

03:24:41.190 --> 03:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
life
 
03:24:41.200 --> 03:24:42.229 align:start position:0%
life
it's

03:24:42.229 --> 03:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:24:44.469 --> 03:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
it's really that real for people here in
 
03:24:47.670 --> 03:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for black brown
 
03:24:49.750 --> 03:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
indigenous people here in new hampshire
 
03:24:51.110 --> 03:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
and i think what's sad about this
 
03:24:53.269 --> 03:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
conversation is
 
03:24:54.630 --> 03:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
some on the other side people who
 
03:24:57.590 --> 03:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
support this bill and the the efforts to
 
03:24:59.110 --> 03:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
sort of chill this speech i think it
 
03:25:01.349 --> 03:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
comes from a misunderstanding about what
 
03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here i don't think
 
03:25:04.950 --> 03:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
anyone hates america
 
03:25:07.349 --> 03:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
i don't i mean very few people hate this
 
03:25:09.510 --> 03:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
country here in this room if anyone i
 
03:25:11.910 --> 03:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
think we all have some serious deep love
 
03:25:13.590 --> 03:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
for this country or we wouldn't be here
 
03:25:13.600 --> 03:25:14.710 align:start position:0%
for this country or we wouldn't be here
otherwise

03:25:14.710 --> 03:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
03:25:17.910 --> 03:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
we all have some understanding of the
 
03:25:17.920 --> 03:25:18.870 align:start position:0%
we all have some understanding of the
horrors

03:25:18.870 --> 03:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
horrors
 
03:25:20.790 --> 03:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
that government
 
03:25:23.510 --> 03:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
or an unchecked government
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
can do to people
 
03:25:25.120 --> 03:25:26.150 align:start position:0%
can do to people
um

03:25:26.150 --> 03:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:28.630 --> 03:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
why would we not want the future leaders
 
03:25:30.389 --> 03:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
of our country the future educators of
 
03:25:31.590 --> 03:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
our country
 
03:25:34.389 --> 03:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
to have a full and fruitful discussion
 
03:25:37.349 --> 03:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
about those horrors you know it's not
 
03:25:39.590 --> 03:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
a teacher's job to advocate for a
 
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
position i think everyone would agree
 
03:25:43.910 --> 03:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
with that but it is a teacher's job
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
to present the facts and let the
 
03:25:49.190 --> 03:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
students debate let them figure it out
 
03:25:51.510 --> 03:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
and i think i i can it's you know i have
 
03:25:53.030 --> 03:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
teachers who
 
03:25:55.590 --> 03:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
from uh my time in commvault who are
 
03:25:57.190 --> 03:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
have come to me because i'm an organizer
 
03:25:59.030 --> 03:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
in this space and they said i'm already
 
03:26:00.710 --> 03:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
feeling this chilling effect without
 
03:26:02.790 --> 03:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
this legislation having even
 
03:26:04.710 --> 03:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
truly been passed and all these other
 
03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
legislation's been passed i'm already
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
feeling this chilling effect i already
 
03:26:09.269 --> 03:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
feel like
 
03:26:10.870 --> 03:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
there's some parents out there who would
 
03:26:12.469 --> 03:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
report me to
 
03:26:13.990 --> 03:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know that i could
 
03:26:16.389 --> 03:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
maybe not face serious consequences but
 
03:26:19.269 --> 03:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
why would you uh even go
 
03:26:19.279 --> 03:26:21.190 align:start position:0%
why would you uh even go
through

03:26:21.190 --> 03:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:26:23.269 --> 03:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
minimal consequences just for teaching
 
03:26:24.229 --> 03:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
you know why would you have to put
 
03:26:26.229 --> 03:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
yourself through the wringer if no one's
 
03:26:29.110 --> 03:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
going to stand with you and i think
 
03:26:32.630 --> 03:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
really we should focus on uh the
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
serious problems that are happening in
 
03:26:36.870 --> 03:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
this country and not um
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
this sort of culture war around
 
03:26:42.229 --> 03:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
critical race theory because there are
 
03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know i think of the the black kids
 
03:26:45.510 --> 03:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
who are in conval now i mean i know a
 
03:26:47.750 --> 03:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
couple of them who are in my school now
 
03:26:47.760 --> 03:26:48.550 align:start position:0%
couple of them who are in my school now
who

03:26:48.550 --> 03:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:26:50.389 --> 03:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
if they don't have that same
 
03:26:52.070 --> 03:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
conversation with a third grade teacher
 
03:26:54.550 --> 03:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
or one of their high school teachers
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
what if they feel as isolated as i did
 
03:26:59.750 --> 03:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then they make the decision that i
 
03:27:02.229 --> 03:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
was able not to make i mean that's
 
03:27:05.670 --> 03:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
a real fear of mine and i just
 
03:27:07.670 --> 03:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
in whatever decision the committee makes
 
03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
i hope that
 
03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
we try our best not to chill this speech
 
03:27:14.150 --> 03:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
to make our education institutions of
 
03:27:16.469 --> 03:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
one of fruitful discussion so that we
 
03:27:18.870 --> 03:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
can move forward from the horrors that
 
03:27:20.790 --> 03:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
our country our government and yes
 
03:27:22.309 --> 03:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes our people have done i don't
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
think this is a racist country i don't
 
03:27:26.630 --> 03:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
think uh any of you here are racist
 
03:27:27.750 --> 03:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
don't think you'd let me in the room
 
03:27:30.790 --> 03:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise or you'd be not listening
 
03:27:33.269 --> 03:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
so i i don't believe this is from racist
 
03:27:36.150 --> 03:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
motivations and i think we can all come
 
03:27:38.550 --> 03:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
together and work together to create a
 
03:27:40.630 --> 03:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
different world where we can all talk
 
03:27:42.229 --> 03:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
about the facts and realities of our
 
03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
country yes the horrors and the good
 
03:27:46.870 --> 03:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
things in a fruitful and honest way
 
03:27:48.550 --> 03:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
i don't want to take too much your time
 
03:27:51.110 --> 03:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
but thank you very much chairman lad
 
03:27:54.150 --> 03:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very very much appreciate it
 
03:27:55.269 --> 03:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
03:27:55.279 --> 03:27:57.670 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

03:27:57.670 --> 03:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:27:57.680 --> 03:27:58.790 align:start position:0%
committee
thanks

03:27:58.790 --> 03:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
yes represent hops
 
03:28:00.960 --> 03:28:01.990 align:start position:0%
yes represent hops
hi

03:28:01.990 --> 03:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
hi
 
03:28:03.670 --> 03:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
um i don't really have a question
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
formulated yet so i'm hoping that if i
 
03:28:07.510 --> 03:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
take enough time to tell you thank you
 
03:28:08.950 --> 03:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
for coming
 
03:28:12.150 --> 03:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony and
 
03:28:14.309 --> 03:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your
 
03:28:14.319 --> 03:28:16.550 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your
honesty

03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
honesty
 
03:28:19.429 --> 03:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
i would like to know how we can have
 
03:28:21.830 --> 03:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
these conversations
 
03:28:23.910 --> 03:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
because there are not many people
 
03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
willing to have them
 
03:28:29.190 --> 03:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
and what would your
 
03:28:31.750 --> 03:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
what would have helped you as a child in
 
03:28:34.229 --> 03:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
third grade
 
03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
i i think before you go into an in-depth
 
03:28:39.269 --> 03:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
on that one i'll make it short because i
 
03:28:41.030 --> 03:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
could talk all day about my third i'll
 
03:28:43.030 --> 03:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
make it short don't worry
 
03:28:44.870 --> 03:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay but thank you i was just gonna say
 
03:28:47.110 --> 03:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
i don't really have a prescription for
 
03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
it you know i'm not necessarily too sure
 
03:28:51.190 --> 03:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
but i know for
 
03:28:53.269 --> 03:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent uh if it wasn't just
 
03:28:55.030 --> 03:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
me and the teacher if i could have a
 
03:28:57.030 --> 03:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
discussion with my students about the
 
03:28:58.950 --> 03:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
reality and if the teacher wasn't you
 
03:29:00.309 --> 03:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
know she made a decision that i think
 
03:29:01.750 --> 03:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
was a good one and she said i don't
 
03:29:02.790 --> 03:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
think the third grader should learn
 
03:29:04.950 --> 03:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
about this right now but if we could get
 
03:29:06.389 --> 03:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
to a position where
 
03:29:08.150 --> 03:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
high school students could have a
 
03:29:09.429 --> 03:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
fruitful discussion that's not just
 
03:29:11.110 --> 03:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
writing a paper and then handing it off
 
03:29:13.030 --> 03:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
to the student but the teacher but a
 
03:29:14.950 --> 03:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
fruitful discussion really sitting down
 
03:29:16.870 --> 03:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
and having a conversation about what are
 
03:29:18.550 --> 03:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
these issues why did this happen and
 
03:29:20.469 --> 03:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
what can we do about it
 
03:29:21.830 --> 03:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
that never happened in high school that
 
03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
never happened in middle school that
 
03:29:25.030 --> 03:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
never happened in elementary school
 
03:29:26.870 --> 03:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
this idea of education being a place
 
03:29:28.309 --> 03:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
where conversations happen it doesn't
 
03:29:31.510 --> 03:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
happen you have kids writing
 
03:29:33.830 --> 03:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
papers focusing on their own thing not
 
03:29:36.150 --> 03:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
even talking to each other and now
 
03:29:37.830 --> 03:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
wearing masks and all these things and
 
03:29:41.190 --> 03:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
totally isolated so totally isolated
 
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
i think we need to not isolate our
 
03:29:43.120 --> 03:29:44.550 align:start position:0%
i think we need to not isolate our
children

03:29:44.550 --> 03:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:29:44.560 --> 03:29:45.429 align:start position:0%
children
and

03:29:45.429 --> 03:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:47.429 --> 03:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
create a fruitful discussion in the
 
03:29:47.439 --> 03:29:48.550 align:start position:0%
create a fruitful discussion in the
schools

03:29:48.550 --> 03:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:29:50.550 --> 03:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
ending this sort of standardized
 
03:29:53.030 --> 03:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
education i think that would do a lot
 
03:29:56.550 --> 03:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you very much
 
03:30:02.070 --> 03:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:04.229 --> 03:30:04.239 align:start position:0%

miss macoff whose portrait hangs in this

room as the only portrait in this room
 
03:30:38.710 --> 03:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
we know her story
 
03:30:40.870 --> 03:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
and i won't dare to assume her reasons
 
03:30:42.950 --> 03:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
for wanting to be a teacher in space but
 
03:30:45.190 --> 03:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
i will use a few of our quotes
 
03:30:47.830 --> 03:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
saying i want to demystify
 
03:30:50.469 --> 03:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
nasa and space flight i want students to
 
03:30:52.950 --> 03:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
see to understand the special
 
03:30:55.269 --> 03:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
perspective of space and relate it to
 
03:30:55.279 --> 03:30:56.550 align:start position:0%
perspective of space and relate it to
them

03:30:56.550 --> 03:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:31:00.150 --> 03:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
humanize the experience
 
03:31:05.670 --> 03:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
it was also reported at the time in 1985
 
03:31:09.120 --> 03:31:10.870 align:start position:0%
it was also reported at the time in 1985
1986

03:31:10.870 --> 03:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
1986
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
that mcauliffe's colleagues and friends
 
03:31:14.229 --> 03:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire said that in and out of
 
03:31:16.630 --> 03:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
the classroom mcauliffe was a historian
 
03:31:18.389 --> 03:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
with the conviction
 
03:31:20.630 --> 03:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
that the experience of ordinary people
 
03:31:23.190 --> 03:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
was as proper a subject of history as
 
03:31:25.670 --> 03:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
chronicles of wars and politicians and a
 
03:31:26.950 --> 03:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
young student
 
03:31:28.870 --> 03:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
named mike dillion was quoted in the new
 
03:31:30.070 --> 03:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
york times
 
03:31:32.469 --> 03:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
as saying she gives a lesson and then
 
03:31:35.349 --> 03:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
she has a story to tell
 
03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
and i look at the portrait that's in
 
03:31:40.229 --> 03:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if
 
03:31:44.150 --> 03:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
miss mcauliffe would be able to tell her
 
03:31:46.630 --> 03:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
stories under this bill and under the
 
03:31:49.349 --> 03:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
conditions we have today
 
03:31:51.030 --> 03:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
worrying that her credential is going to
 
03:31:55.910 --> 03:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:58.550 --> 03:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
i'll leave you with one more quote from
 
03:32:00.630 --> 03:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
miss mcauliffe who's inspired a
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
generation of educators including me
 
03:32:06.389 --> 03:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
i realize there's a risk outside your
 
03:32:09.429 --> 03:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
everyday life but it doesn't frighten me
 
03:32:10.950 --> 03:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
please do the right thing
 
03:32:13.269 --> 03:32:13.279 align:start position:0%

03:33:10.950 --> 03:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility as well as a very limited
 
03:33:12.389 --> 03:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
pay grade you guys only get about a
 
03:33:14.630 --> 03:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a year so i i really
 
03:33:15.990 --> 03:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
want to thank you all for the public
 
03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:23.110 align:start position:0%
want to thank you all for the public
service

03:33:23.110 --> 03:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:23.120 --> 03:33:24.150 align:start position:0%
 
despite

03:33:24.150 --> 03:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
despite
 
03:33:27.750 --> 03:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
my dis my deeply seated disagreement and
 
03:33:29.510 --> 03:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
borderline disgust that i feel towards
 
03:33:32.070 --> 03:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
this bill it in no way diminishes the
 
03:33:33.670 --> 03:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of respect that i have
 
03:33:38.550 --> 03:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:40.389 --> 03:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
i come before you today not as someone
 
03:33:42.870 --> 03:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
who is fundamentally anti-american
 
03:33:44.950 --> 03:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
seeking to destroy this country or tear
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
down the incredible legacy and
 
03:33:48.870 --> 03:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous bravery that is so deeply
 
03:33:50.870 --> 03:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
intertwined with the founding of our
 
03:33:52.790 --> 03:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
nation but rather is somebody who is
 
03:33:55.030 --> 03:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
deeply proud of and grateful for our
 
03:33:55.040 --> 03:33:56.309 align:start position:0%
deeply proud of and grateful for our
past

03:33:56.309 --> 03:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
past
 
03:33:57.910 --> 03:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
engaged with the maintaining of the
 
03:34:00.309 --> 03:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
present and hopeful towards the future
 
03:34:01.750 --> 03:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
of this country
 
03:34:03.990 --> 03:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
it is this pride in our country
 
03:34:06.469 --> 03:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
including its history that compl compels
 
03:34:08.630 --> 03:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
me to urge the members of this committee
 
03:34:10.630 --> 03:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
to vote against the passage of house
 
03:34:12.389 --> 03:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
bill 1255.
 
03:34:14.469 --> 03:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
this law while written with the best of
 
03:34:17.110 --> 03:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
intentions has an unparalleled capacity
 
03:34:18.790 --> 03:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
to cause irreparable harm to this
 
03:34:21.030 --> 03:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
country through the political precedent
 
03:34:22.389 --> 03:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
that it sets
 
03:34:24.229 --> 03:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
the restrictions to the fundamental
 
03:34:25.990 --> 03:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
right of free speech that it places on
 
03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
our public educators and the
 
03:34:30.389 --> 03:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
irreversible impact that this bill would
 
03:34:33.030 --> 03:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
have on our ability to openly and
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
honestly confront our past
 
03:34:37.750 --> 03:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
our education system is one of the most
 
03:34:39.429 --> 03:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
important parts of this country which is
 
03:34:40.630 --> 03:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
another reason that i'm grateful that
 
03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
every single member of this committee
 
03:34:44.550 --> 03:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
and they're tasked with equipping future
 
03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
generations with the vital skills and
 
03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge that they need to be
 
03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
productive members of society as well as
 
03:34:52.309 --> 03:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
informed and responsible voters it is
 
03:34:53.670 --> 03:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
because of this tremendous
 
03:34:56.309 --> 03:34:56.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility that any and all attempts
 
03:34:59.030 --> 03:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
at flagrant partisan tampering foisted
 
03:35:00.550 --> 03:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
upon these institutions by the
 
03:35:03.190 --> 03:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
government whether stated federal should
 
03:35:05.750 --> 03:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
never be tolerated
 
03:35:07.349 --> 03:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
they are beneath the values that
 
03:35:09.030 --> 03:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
underpin the creation of this very
 
03:35:11.269 --> 03:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
nation and betray the principles of free
 
03:35:15.030 --> 03:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
speech open discussion and robust lively
 
03:35:17.670 --> 03:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
national debate
 
03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
we should strive to pass those values
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
the values that have had me sitting
 
03:35:23.110 --> 03:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
before you today
 
03:35:25.269 --> 03:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
on to the future generations and
 
03:35:27.510 --> 03:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully as a citizen of new hampshire
 
03:35:29.269 --> 03:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
and have been for my entire life i hope
 
03:35:30.870 --> 03:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
that my kids will one day get to be a
 
03:35:33.910 --> 03:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
part of that robust debate
 
03:35:36.070 --> 03:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
i understand especially from
 
03:35:38.790 --> 03:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative lackas testimony that the
 
03:35:40.790 --> 03:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
goal of this bill
 
03:35:42.309 --> 03:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
is to try and stand against
 
03:35:44.229 --> 03:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
indoctrination and i can understand
 
03:35:46.950 --> 03:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
exactly how important that is but with
 
03:35:49.510 --> 03:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
the text as it's currently written i i
 
03:35:51.030 --> 03:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
honestly fear
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
that the consequences of this
 
03:35:53.840 --> 03:35:54.630 align:start position:0%
that the consequences of this
are

03:35:54.630 --> 03:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:35:57.110 --> 03:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
are ultimately going to be ones that
 
03:35:59.590 --> 03:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
obfuscate and stand in the way of the
 
03:36:01.510 --> 03:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
ability to have an honest discussion in
 
03:36:02.950 --> 03:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
this country
 
03:36:05.510 --> 03:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
well ideologically i think we can all
 
03:36:08.070 --> 03:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
agree that racism was not necessarily
 
03:36:10.229 --> 03:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
the foundation that america was laid on
 
03:36:11.910 --> 03:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's not like people created a nation
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
and said we're going to be a nation of
 
03:36:15.670 --> 03:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
slave owners it was founded on that on
 
03:36:18.309 --> 03:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
the ideas of personal civil liberty it
 
03:36:19.590 --> 03:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
was founded on the ideas of
 
03:36:21.110 --> 03:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
enlightenment it was founded on the
 
03:36:23.670 --> 03:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
ideas based on people like adam smith it
 
03:36:25.429 --> 03:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
was founded on the the ideas of
 
03:36:28.389 --> 03:36:28.399 align:start position:0%
alexander hamilton it was founded on on
 
03:36:30.070 --> 03:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
the ideas of some of the most incredible
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
thinkers that have that have come out of
 
03:36:34.710 --> 03:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
the world even to this day
 
03:36:36.469 --> 03:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
but the truth is that at a at a
 
03:36:38.309 --> 03:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
structural level not just at an
 
03:36:41.269 --> 03:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
ideological one there are lots of ideas
 
03:36:43.110 --> 03:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
inside of this country that
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
fundamentally are racist
 
03:36:47.910 --> 03:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
the three-fifth compromise is not
 
03:36:50.550 --> 03:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
something that is not baked into the
 
03:36:52.389 --> 03:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
center of this country
 
03:36:54.309 --> 03:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
inside of the legislation where the
 
03:36:56.710 --> 03:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
three-fifth compromise shows up it also
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
directly talks about the fact that
 
03:36:59.910 --> 03:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
indians are not counted inside of
 
03:37:02.229 --> 03:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
representation inside of this country we
 
03:37:05.190 --> 03:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
can't act like those aren't facts
 
03:37:07.750 --> 03:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
i understand the purpose of this bill i
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
understand that it comes from the best
 
03:37:13.030 --> 03:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
of intentions but ultimately
 
03:37:13.040 --> 03:37:13.750 align:start position:0%
of intentions but ultimately
i

03:37:13.750 --> 03:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
i have a severe worry that these aren't
 
03:37:17.429 --> 03:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
issues that we can talk about openly and
 
03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
honestly especially because the language
 
03:37:23.030 --> 03:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
of advocation is so vague i i am not a
 
03:37:25.349 --> 03:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
product of our public education system i
 
03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
was very lovingly raised by two
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
homeschool parents who are both very
 
03:37:29.279 --> 03:37:30.870 align:start position:0%
homeschool parents who are both very
conservative

03:37:30.870 --> 03:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
conservative
 
03:37:32.790 --> 03:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
and and they they gave me the skills
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
necessary to learn how to think not just
 
03:37:36.870 --> 03:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
what to think and it's because of that
 
03:37:39.110 --> 03:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
that i got obsessed with both public
 
03:37:41.110 --> 03:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
policy and debate which is something
 
03:37:43.510 --> 03:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
that i spent my entire adolescence
 
03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
studying and learning how to do
 
03:37:44.880 --> 03:37:46.150 align:start position:0%
studying and learning how to do
correctly

03:37:46.150 --> 03:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
03:37:46.160 --> 03:37:47.349 align:start position:0%
correctly
um

03:37:47.349 --> 03:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:49.269 --> 03:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
but but it's also because of that
 
03:37:51.110 --> 03:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
education that i
 
03:37:53.349 --> 03:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
i mean honestly i'm really concerned one
 
03:37:54.870 --> 03:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
of the things that was brought up a lot
 
03:37:56.550 --> 03:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
was this idea of indoctrination and
 
03:37:59.269 --> 03:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
while i can understand why why there's a
 
03:38:01.110 --> 03:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern there especially when
 
03:38:03.670 --> 03:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a public institution
 
03:38:05.910 --> 03:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
um i think that there's something that's
 
03:38:07.590 --> 03:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
really important to recognize about
 
03:38:09.510 --> 03:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
ideology and it comes from one of my
 
03:38:11.750 --> 03:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
favorite quotes ever the the problem
 
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
really with ideology is that if you
 
03:38:16.309 --> 03:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
don't see one it's yours
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
no matter what we do there are going to
 
03:38:20.469 --> 03:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
be ideological elements to the way that
 
03:38:22.150 --> 03:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
we teach there are going to be
 
03:38:24.229 --> 03:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
ideological elements to the way that we
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
we speak to our children and and i can
 
03:38:29.590 --> 03:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
understand the the desire to curtail
 
03:38:31.750 --> 03:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
that and create a nation that's
 
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's proud of our history
 
03:38:34.720 --> 03:38:36.070 align:start position:0%
that's proud of our history
but

03:38:36.070 --> 03:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:38:38.150 --> 03:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
and and one that wants to continue the
 
03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
traditions that we have so far but
 
03:38:44.790 --> 03:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
in the exact same breath we can't do
 
03:38:47.429 --> 03:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
that unless we recognize that the trail
 
03:38:49.590 --> 03:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
of tears is baked into the the history
 
03:38:51.670 --> 03:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
of this country we can't do that
 
03:38:53.429 --> 03:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
effectively if we don't talk about the
 
03:38:54.469 --> 03:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
03:38:56.630 --> 03:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
slavery was so embedded in the creation
 
03:38:58.309 --> 03:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
of this country that we had to fight a
 
03:39:00.630 --> 03:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
civil war for it and even after that
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
civil war was done we weren't truly
 
03:39:05.189 --> 03:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
finished with the idea of
 
03:39:07.750 --> 03:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
overcoming racism and even through the
 
03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
work of martin luther king jr we still
 
03:39:12.790 --> 03:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
have lots of issues we've had struggles
 
03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
with redlining we've had struggles with
 
03:39:16.870 --> 03:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
disproportionate policing and some of
 
03:39:18.630 --> 03:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
those things are politicized and i can
 
03:39:20.070 --> 03:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
certainly understand that not every
 
03:39:21.429 --> 03:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
member of this committee is going to
 
03:39:24.070 --> 03:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
agree with me but i think that it's
 
03:39:24.080 --> 03:39:25.030 align:start position:0%
agree with me but i think that it's
totally

03:39:25.030 --> 03:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
totally
 
03:39:27.910 --> 03:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest that we need to
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
give our educators the ability to be
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest on these issues
 
03:39:33.920 --> 03:39:39.189 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest on these issues
um

03:39:39.189 --> 03:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:41.189 --> 03:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
i think that's about all i have to say i
 
03:39:43.349 --> 03:39:43.359 align:start position:0%

yesterday and spend about three hours
 
03:39:53.910 --> 03:39:53.920 align:start position:0%

3 500 teachers power educators school
 
03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%

03:41:32.550 --> 03:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
and higher ed staff across the state of
 
03:41:34.469 --> 03:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i'm happy to be able to
 
03:41:36.070 --> 03:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
bring the perspective of my members here
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
03:41:40.150 --> 03:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
we obviously oppose hb 1255 and i did
 
03:41:42.309 --> 03:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
listen carefully to the earlier speakers
 
03:41:45.189 --> 03:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
about the intent of the bill and how
 
03:41:47.429 --> 03:41:47.439 align:start position:0%
they felt it was not represented in what
 
03:41:47.439 --> 03:41:48.790 align:start position:0%
they felt it was not represented in what
was

03:41:48.790 --> 03:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:41:51.590 --> 03:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
written up in the bill
 
03:41:51.600 --> 03:41:52.710 align:start position:0%
written up in the bill
however

03:41:52.710 --> 03:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
it did not address our concerns we feel
 
03:41:57.269 --> 03:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
that what was written up and what i
 
03:41:59.910 --> 03:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
heard earlier is so vague it will still
 
03:42:01.269 --> 03:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
have that
 
03:42:03.510 --> 03:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
chilling effect and make it almost
 
03:42:06.870 --> 03:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
impossible for teachers to understand
 
03:42:09.510 --> 03:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
what they can permissibly
 
03:42:11.590 --> 03:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
teach in the classroom
 
03:42:14.469 --> 03:42:14.479 align:start position:0%
and do their jobs well and faithfully by
 
03:42:16.710 --> 03:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
their students our members are dedicated
 
03:42:18.229 --> 03:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
to meeting the students needs by
 
03:42:20.550 --> 03:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
engaging them in honest history lessons
 
03:42:22.150 --> 03:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
that teach them to think critically
 
03:42:24.070 --> 03:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
about information it would be a
 
03:42:25.670 --> 03:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
disservice to our students to limit
 
03:42:27.429 --> 03:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
their class materials or discussions
 
03:42:29.349 --> 03:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
only to the parts of our history that
 
03:42:32.790 --> 03:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
show our nation in a positive light
 
03:42:34.150 --> 03:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
the problem with
 
03:42:37.830 --> 03:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
saying you don't want endocrine
 
03:42:39.910 --> 03:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
is indoctrination is in the eye of the
 
03:42:39.920 --> 03:42:41.189 align:start position:0%
is indoctrination is in the eye of the
beholder

03:42:41.189 --> 03:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
beholder
 
03:42:41.199 --> 03:42:42.070 align:start position:0%
beholder
um

03:42:42.070 --> 03:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:44.070 --> 03:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
it is a very subjective term is a very
 
03:42:45.750 --> 03:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
vague term and
 
03:42:47.590 --> 03:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
frankly that's
 
03:42:49.269 --> 03:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
the big problem with the divisive
 
03:42:51.030 --> 03:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
concepts law from last year it's so
 
03:42:54.229 --> 03:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
vague that there's a lawsuit over it
 
03:42:56.229 --> 03:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
and when you tie that to people's
 
03:42:56.239 --> 03:42:58.469 align:start position:0%
and when you tie that to people's
livelihoods

03:42:58.469 --> 03:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
livelihoods
 
03:42:58.479 --> 03:43:00.229 align:start position:0%
livelihoods
then

03:43:00.229 --> 03:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:43:01.830 --> 03:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
you have
 
03:43:04.710 --> 03:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
put a punishment over
 
03:43:06.550 --> 03:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
something that is vague and subjective
 
03:43:08.550 --> 03:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
if you're a teacher this legislation
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
leaves you confused on how you can talk
 
03:43:13.030 --> 03:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
about many subjects in your classroom
 
03:43:14.710 --> 03:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
and we've heard several examples from
 
03:43:16.550 --> 03:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
other speakers including the
 
03:43:18.790 --> 03:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
three-fifths compromise
 
03:43:20.229 --> 03:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
they will have such a chilling effects
 
03:43:21.750 --> 03:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
the teachers will feel intimidated
 
03:43:24.070 --> 03:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
uncertain and hampered from teaching a
 
03:43:26.389 --> 03:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
full account of our nation's history
 
03:43:27.590 --> 03:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
even worse
 
03:43:29.269 --> 03:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
the bill undermines our children's
 
03:43:31.510 --> 03:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
education and their ability to grow into
 
03:43:34.389 --> 03:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
engaged citizens and critical thinkers
 
03:43:34.399 --> 03:43:35.429 align:start position:0%
engaged citizens and critical thinkers
so

03:43:35.429 --> 03:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:35.439 --> 03:43:36.550 align:start position:0%
so
it's

03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:43:37.910 --> 03:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
taking away
 
03:43:39.830 --> 03:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
from both our teachers ability to do
 
03:43:42.630 --> 03:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.640 --> 03:43:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
thoroughly

03:43:44.150 --> 03:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
thoroughly
 
03:43:45.750 --> 03:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
and honestly
 
03:43:47.830 --> 03:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
as taking away from our students it's
 
03:43:49.670 --> 03:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
taking away the
 
03:43:51.750 --> 03:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
tools they need
 
03:43:53.429 --> 03:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to learn
 
03:43:55.269 --> 03:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to get what they need from
 
03:43:57.750 --> 03:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
their um from their teachers and from
 
03:43:59.670 --> 03:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
their classes they need to be able to
 
03:44:02.150 --> 03:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
have those open house discussions to be
 
03:44:04.309 --> 03:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
able to explore topics
 
03:44:05.910 --> 03:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know we have heard from our members
 
03:44:07.910 --> 03:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
that they are afraid of going near
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
certain topics already and this would
 
03:44:11.750 --> 03:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
double down on it
 
03:44:11.760 --> 03:44:13.910 align:start position:0%
double down on it
um

03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:16.389 --> 03:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
i will close with a quote here or get to
 
03:44:18.229 --> 03:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
in just a moment public education is the
 
03:44:20.950 --> 03:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
lifeblood of our democracy preparing the
 
03:44:22.790 --> 03:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
next generation for college career and
 
03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
life the core of our job as educators is
 
03:44:27.990 --> 03:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
to teach the skills students need to
 
03:44:28.000 --> 03:44:29.349 align:start position:0%
to teach the skills students need to
succeed

03:44:29.349 --> 03:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
succeed
 
03:44:31.750 --> 03:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
showing history as it really happened
 
03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
isn't disloyalty
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
as historian james bryce wrote back in
 
03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
1909 true patriotism consists not in
 
03:44:40.710 --> 03:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
waving a flag not in shouting our
 
03:44:43.030 --> 03:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
country right or wrong but in so value
 
03:44:44.790 --> 03:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
you're valuing our country and
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
respecting its best traditions
 
03:44:49.110 --> 03:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
as to desire to strive that our country
 
03:44:51.590 --> 03:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
shall be righteous as well as strong
 
03:44:53.590 --> 03:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
hiding the truth from our children both
 
03:44:55.750 --> 03:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
wounds their trust in us and dishonors
 
03:44:58.469 --> 03:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
the true meaning of patriotism
 
03:45:00.150 --> 03:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
we need to be honest with them we need
 
03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
to teach
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
true honest robust history and allow
 
03:45:07.510 --> 03:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
them to have honest and open discussions
 
03:45:10.550 --> 03:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
no one's indoctrinating
 
03:45:13.510 --> 03:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
we need to let
 
03:45:16.150 --> 03:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's subjective yes you see and that's
 
03:45:17.670 --> 03:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
the problem with making a law that
 
03:45:19.349 --> 03:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
punishes people
 
03:45:19.359 --> 03:45:20.469 align:start position:0%
punishes people
for

03:45:20.469 --> 03:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:45:20.479 --> 03:45:22.070 align:start position:0%
for
teaching

03:45:22.070 --> 03:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
03:45:26.710 --> 03:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:28.710 --> 03:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
these laws don't help kids learn they
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
don't help teachers teach what they will
 
03:45:32.150 --> 03:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
do is deprive our children of a quality
 
03:45:33.990 --> 03:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
education by instilling fear in the
 
03:45:36.150 --> 03:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
classroom and pushing a sugar-coated
 
03:45:38.150 --> 03:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
shallow version of our country's history
 
03:45:39.670 --> 03:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
i urge you to vote this bill and
 
03:45:42.550 --> 03:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
expedient legislate and i will pass this
 
03:45:44.950 --> 03:45:44.960 align:start position:0%

03:45:54.160 --> 03:45:55.510 align:start position:0%
from a legislative program that you have

within
 
03:45:55.520 --> 03:45:58.070 align:start position:0%
within
welcome

03:45:58.070 --> 03:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:58.080 --> 03:45:59.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:45:59.189 --> 03:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:01.429 --> 03:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
we have two to go here and for those
 
03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:03.760 align:start position:0%

to be slipping behind the half hour and

all our bills
 
03:46:11.030 --> 03:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're already there and the committee
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
needs to have a chance to get up and
 
03:46:13.680 --> 03:46:14.950 align:start position:0%
needs to have a chance to get up and
refresh

03:46:14.950 --> 03:46:14.960 align:start position:0%

03:46:18.880 --> 03:46:20.469 align:start position:0%
try to get through these last two cards
quickly

03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
the next one is from um
 
03:46:26.469 --> 03:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
i i asked my i had a hard time with your
 
03:46:30.630 --> 03:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:32.790 --> 03:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
is that asma
 
03:46:35.189 --> 03:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay asma and it's
 
03:46:38.229 --> 03:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
pronounced like the letter s
 
03:46:40.469 --> 03:46:40.479 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you
 
03:46:41.590 --> 03:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
well welcome
 
03:46:44.389 --> 03:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
thanks um for having me here again today
 
03:46:46.630 --> 03:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh so again my name is esmahini i'm with
 
03:46:49.269 --> 03:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
rights and democracy um i speak to you
 
03:46:51.429 --> 03:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
today as not only an employee with
 
03:46:53.269 --> 03:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
rights and democracy but also an
 
03:46:55.510 --> 03:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
immigrant and as i said yesterday a
 
03:46:57.750 --> 03:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
global citizen of the world
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
um it seems that a lot of the provisions
 
03:47:03.189 --> 03:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
of yesterday's bill 1632 was also stuck
 
03:47:04.469 --> 03:47:04.479 align:start position:0%
into this
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
bill 1255 and so i'm not going to repeat
 
03:47:09.670 --> 03:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
my arguments but i just wanted to just
 
03:47:12.309 --> 03:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
give a gist which is it's great that
 
03:47:14.630 --> 03:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
people want to teach about other
 
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
countries and i totally agree with that
 
03:47:19.110 --> 03:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
but that is not what this bill is going
 
03:47:20.309 --> 03:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:47:24.150 --> 03:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
and so i am definitely opposed to it
 
03:47:24.160 --> 03:47:28.309 align:start position:0%
and so i am definitely opposed to it
um

03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:31.189 --> 03:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
so basically again the bill the reason
 
03:47:32.389 --> 03:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
why it would be good to learn about
 
03:47:33.510 --> 03:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
other countries is because you want to
 
03:47:35.349 --> 03:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
teach about a world view but again this
 
03:47:38.150 --> 03:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
is not um a way to do it we instead
 
03:47:39.990 --> 03:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
teachers would be downplaying our
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
mistakes by pointing to others which
 
03:47:44.229 --> 03:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
teaches students to deflect their own
 
03:47:46.870 --> 03:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
mistakes so we have to keep that in mind
 
03:47:49.110 --> 03:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
i'm also quite disturbed that this bill
 
03:47:51.429 --> 03:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
has expanded divisive concepts to
 
03:47:53.110 --> 03:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
include other topics
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
and some of them are socialism and
 
03:47:57.030 --> 03:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
marxism and if this passes there's
 
03:47:58.790 --> 03:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
obviously going to be more topics that
 
03:48:00.229 --> 03:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
are surely going to be added on to
 
03:48:02.550 --> 03:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
divisive concepts so i'd like to explain
 
03:48:04.630 --> 03:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
why this is egrogus
 
03:48:06.870 --> 03:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
and also the fact that this bill poses
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
consequences disciplinary consequences
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
which further puts an already at edge
 
03:48:15.030 --> 03:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
educational system and teaching force at
 
03:48:17.349 --> 03:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
an even more vulnerable state
 
03:48:18.950 --> 03:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
so several things i'd like to point out
 
03:48:21.189 --> 03:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
when talking about marxism
 
03:48:24.309 --> 03:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
there are things that marx got right
 
03:48:27.189 --> 03:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
and there are things that marx got wrong
 
03:48:29.189 --> 03:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
there are theories in marxism and
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
socialism that many of us here will
 
03:48:34.469 --> 03:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
agree with for example abolishing child
 
03:48:37.349 --> 03:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
labor so shall we teach
 
03:48:39.030 --> 03:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
banishing that
 
03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
because that's marxism marxism and
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
socialism is a con conglomerate of
 
03:48:48.550 --> 03:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
theories many many theories it does not
 
03:48:51.510 --> 03:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:53.830 --> 03:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
again some are right some are wrong
 
03:48:55.990 --> 03:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
theories whatever theories they can be
 
03:48:58.150 --> 03:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
are challenged and are challenged all
 
03:49:00.309 --> 03:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
the time
 
03:49:02.229 --> 03:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
it's a part of human history to have
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
theories and to wrestle with them the
 
03:49:07.510 --> 03:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
danger is banning theories it keeps us
 
03:49:09.349 --> 03:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
from being able to explore and
 
03:49:11.670 --> 03:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
investigate our human condition
 
03:49:13.429 --> 03:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
it is sad to think that marx and
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
socialism has just been summed up into
 
03:49:17.830 --> 03:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
overthrowing the government which by the
 
03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
way a democracy also a theory teaches
 
03:49:23.429 --> 03:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
could happen
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
i don't think i need to remind people a
 
03:49:27.990 --> 03:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
government for the people by the people
 
03:49:29.670 --> 03:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons the second
 
03:49:31.750 --> 03:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
amendment was put in place many hold the
 
03:49:34.550 --> 03:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
opinion including many on this committee
 
03:49:37.030 --> 03:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
shall we ban democracy
 
03:49:39.429 --> 03:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
what are we doing why are we limiting
 
03:49:41.910 --> 03:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
the human ability to discern right from
 
03:49:41.920 --> 03:49:43.429 align:start position:0%
the human ability to discern right from
wrong

03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
03:49:46.469 --> 03:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
we have to trust in the human ability to
 
03:49:46.479 --> 03:49:48.389 align:start position:0%
we have to trust in the human ability to
think

03:49:48.389 --> 03:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:49:50.229 --> 03:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
last the part in this bill that gives
 
03:49:52.070 --> 03:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
consequences for teachers teaching the
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
negative aspects of our history which is
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
well documented and can't be denied is
 
03:49:59.830 --> 03:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
only creating an environment to control
 
03:50:02.070 --> 03:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
teachers and robs students of the
 
03:50:04.710 --> 03:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
ability to understand our history
 
03:50:07.670 --> 03:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
because our history is a messy history
 
03:50:10.070 --> 03:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
and that's just a fact it's messy
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
there's good and there is bad in it and
 
03:50:14.870 --> 03:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
the greatest lesson that students can
 
03:50:17.269 --> 03:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
take from that is that we will make
 
03:50:20.309 --> 03:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
mistakes and that there is hope and the
 
03:50:23.189 --> 03:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
possibility to fix our mistakes even
 
03:50:23.199 --> 03:50:24.229 align:start position:0%
possibility to fix our mistakes even
today

03:50:24.229 --> 03:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
just as we have fixed some of our
 
03:50:28.630 --> 03:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
mistakes in the past and see the
 
03:50:31.429 --> 03:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
connection that our past mistakes affect
 
03:50:34.469 --> 03:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
some of the mistakes that we make today
 
03:50:36.550 --> 03:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
and can we and we can address them so
 
03:50:38.150 --> 03:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
that we can truly live into the
 
03:50:40.950 --> 03:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
multi-racial democracy that we should
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
and we can be
 
03:50:45.670 --> 03:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
where white black and brown can thrive
 
03:50:45.680 --> 03:50:46.870 align:start position:0%
where white black and brown can thrive
together

03:50:46.870 --> 03:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:50:49.750 --> 03:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
03:51:02.950 --> 03:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:12.630 --> 03:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:15.269 --> 03:51:15.279 align:start position:0%
okay if you sign up there it technically
 
03:51:17.429 --> 03:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
we do it on the pink cards if you want
 
03:51:19.189 --> 03:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
to speak before the committee so the
 
03:51:20.870 --> 03:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee can
 
03:51:22.469 --> 03:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
have that go ahead and fill that out
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
rousseau go ahead and then we'll
 
03:51:27.269 --> 03:51:27.279 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for allowing me
 
03:51:32.070 --> 03:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
to speak today i am in support of an
 
03:51:34.630 --> 03:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
amendment on this bill i like that i
 
03:51:36.630 --> 03:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
like the idea behind this bill
 
03:51:39.030 --> 03:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because i feel it's
 
03:51:42.309 --> 03:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
necessary in our in our um community
 
03:51:45.910 --> 03:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
today i have children and grandchildren
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire who have been
 
03:51:51.670 --> 03:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
subjected to some of the indoctrination
 
03:51:51.680 --> 03:51:53.269 align:start position:0%
subjected to some of the indoctrination
policies

03:51:53.269 --> 03:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
policies
 
03:51:53.279 --> 03:51:54.150 align:start position:0%
policies
so

03:51:54.150 --> 03:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
i can speak to that
 
03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
i also have um i also worked very
 
03:52:00.950 --> 03:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
closely with christy mcauliffe and
 
03:52:03.349 --> 03:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
although she was she had strong
 
03:52:03.359 --> 03:52:04.389 align:start position:0%
although she was she had strong
um

03:52:04.389 --> 03:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:08.790 --> 03:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
she had a strong moral ethical and um
 
03:52:12.469 --> 03:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
individual compass she provided facts
 
03:52:14.469 --> 03:52:14.479 align:start position:0%
she provided both
 
03:52:14.479 --> 03:52:15.590 align:start position:0%
she provided both
sides

03:52:15.590 --> 03:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
sides
 
03:52:18.150 --> 03:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
and then she helped her children
 
03:52:20.950 --> 03:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
learn to discern and make use their
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
critical thinking skills to develop
 
03:52:23.760 --> 03:52:24.870 align:start position:0%
critical thinking skills to develop
their

03:52:24.870 --> 03:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:52:26.550 --> 03:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
own positions
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
so and in my opinion that is the intent
 
03:52:30.710 --> 03:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:52:33.429 --> 03:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
of this um bill before us
 
03:52:36.150 --> 03:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
i grew up in a time where we didn't
 
03:52:39.189 --> 03:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
notice black or white um
 
03:52:41.349 --> 03:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
i grew up in a time where we called them
 
03:52:43.830 --> 03:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
negroes or
 
03:52:45.670 --> 03:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
african-american or i don't even
 
03:52:49.030 --> 03:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
remember but i i grew up and i had some
 
03:52:52.389 --> 03:52:52.399 align:start position:0%
black children in black students in my
 
03:52:57.030 --> 03:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
school here in new hampshire in the 60s
 
03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
but i can honestly tell you that i
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
didn't even realize that they were black
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
until i looked at my school pictures
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
because i did we didn't identify people
 
03:53:07.189 --> 03:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
that way i didn't identify my teachers
 
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
as the old white teacher i identified
 
03:53:11.910 --> 03:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
her as she was my favorite teacher
 
03:53:14.070 --> 03:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
because she always made sure that i
 
03:53:16.070 --> 03:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
could tie my shoe right
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
and that's something that's that's
 
03:53:19.750 --> 03:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
something that we've lost we identify
 
03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
people by the color of our skin we
 
03:53:23.750 --> 03:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
identify people by their thoughts and
 
03:53:25.349 --> 03:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
their opinions and their sexual
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
orientation and their preference and
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's just wrong we identify them
 
03:53:31.349 --> 03:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
whether they're
 
03:53:34.229 --> 03:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
on the right or on the left or it's just
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and the point is is that it
 
03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
does happen the indoctrination does
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
happen in our school unfortunately
 
03:53:45.269 --> 03:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
the good thing is is i don't think
 
03:53:47.110 --> 03:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
anyone in this room
 
03:53:49.670 --> 03:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
would stand for that i don't think any
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
one of these teachers would con would
 
03:53:55.750 --> 03:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
think or believe that that's happening
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
however i'm talking from someone who has
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
seen it i have been in the classroom and
 
03:54:04.309 --> 03:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
my jaw almost dropped when i've heard
 
03:54:05.830 --> 03:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
some of the words that were coming out
 
03:54:07.750 --> 03:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the teacher's mouth because they
 
03:54:11.590 --> 03:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
thought that i was of the same mindset
 
03:54:13.189 --> 03:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i've heard a lot
 
03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
about is system systemic racism
 
03:54:19.590 --> 03:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
the ugliness of our history the chilling
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
effect that this would cause for the
 
03:54:23.990 --> 03:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
teachers um
 
03:54:25.990 --> 03:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with calling our
 
03:54:29.269 --> 03:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
educator our educators teachers
 
03:54:31.750 --> 03:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
teachers are someone that
 
03:54:35.590 --> 03:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
teaches a teacher is do it this way this
 
03:54:37.670 --> 03:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
is the way you must do it because you're
 
03:54:41.429 --> 03:54:41.439 align:start position:0%
teaching me to do it an educator
 
03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
gives students all the information
 
03:54:45.680 --> 03:54:46.630 align:start position:0%
gives students all the information
and

03:54:46.630 --> 03:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:49.670 --> 03:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
all the facts all the theories
 
03:54:51.670 --> 03:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
and lets them make their own decision
 
03:54:53.910 --> 03:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
very similar to an attorney an attorney
 
03:54:57.670 --> 03:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a position they they
 
03:55:00.550 --> 03:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
they have no opinion you know no opinion
 
03:55:03.269 --> 03:55:03.279 align:start position:0%
or a judge i should say a judge
 
03:55:03.279 --> 03:55:05.910 align:start position:0%
or a judge i should say a judge
um

03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:08.469 --> 03:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
so i would i would argue that it's not
 
03:55:11.830 --> 03:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
our educators job to teach that slavery
 
03:55:15.670 --> 03:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
is wrong although it is in my opinion
 
03:55:15.680 --> 03:55:16.469 align:start position:0%
is wrong although it is in my opinion
um

03:55:16.469 --> 03:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's not the teacher's job to teach
 
03:55:22.150 --> 03:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
about that jim crow laws were wrong or
 
03:55:24.389 --> 03:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
what happened to the japanese americans
 
03:55:25.750 --> 03:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
in our country
 
03:55:28.950 --> 03:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
was wrong what's important is you teach
 
03:55:31.349 --> 03:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
them the facts you provide them with the
 
03:55:34.229 --> 03:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
facts you provide them with the with the
 
03:55:38.309 --> 03:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
ability to understand
 
03:55:40.389 --> 03:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
and form their own
 
03:55:43.349 --> 03:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
philosophies and opinions about what is
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
and is not their truths
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
so although i um
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
i agree with the intent of this bill i
 
03:55:53.189 --> 03:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
think it has a long way to go however i
 
03:55:55.830 --> 03:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
think this bill is a
 
03:55:57.269 --> 03:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
good beginning
 
03:55:57.279 --> 03:55:58.950 align:start position:0%
good beginning
where

03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:56:01.510 --> 03:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
we can develop
 
03:56:04.150 --> 03:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
healing and healthy relationships
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
on the right and on the left
 
03:56:10.630 --> 03:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
on the black and brown and on the white
 
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:56:11.760 --> 03:56:14.070 align:start position:0%
on the
um

03:56:14.070 --> 03:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:17.990 --> 03:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
um individual identities so this is a
 
03:56:20.469 --> 03:56:20.479 align:start position:0%
fantastic opportunity to start
 
03:56:23.429 --> 03:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
developing that communication that
 
03:56:23.439 --> 03:56:24.790 align:start position:0%
developing that communication that
relationship

03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
03:56:28.469 --> 03:56:28.479 align:start position:0%
and if we turn around and we say
 
03:56:31.910 --> 03:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
socialism marxism that's all bad
 
03:56:35.429 --> 03:56:35.439 align:start position:0%
that's not that's theory that's theory
 
03:56:38.309 --> 03:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
what was bat we need to say like the
 
03:56:39.910 --> 03:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
last um
 
03:56:42.790 --> 03:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
presenter just spoke we need to say this
 
03:56:45.110 --> 03:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
is the facts about socialism
 
03:56:46.870 --> 03:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
take what's good
 
03:56:48.550 --> 03:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
throw away what's bad
 
03:56:50.950 --> 03:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
you make the decisions of what's good
 
03:56:53.030 --> 03:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
you make the decisions of what's bad
 
03:56:54.950 --> 03:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
that is what's going to do that is
 
03:56:57.429 --> 03:56:57.439 align:start position:0%
what's going to resolve the divide in
 
03:56:59.189 --> 03:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
our classrooms
 
03:57:01.510 --> 03:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
with our communities and with our
 
03:57:01.520 --> 03:57:04.070 align:start position:0%
with our communities and with our
country

03:57:04.070 --> 03:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
03:57:06.710 --> 03:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:57:06.720 --> 03:57:08.070 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
questions

03:57:08.070 --> 03:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:57:10.630 --> 03:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and our last speaker then is
 
03:57:15.349 --> 03:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:17.349 --> 03:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you i will speak for less than two
 
03:57:17.359 --> 03:57:18.229 align:start position:0%
thank you i will speak for less than two
minutes

03:57:18.229 --> 03:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:57:19.510 --> 03:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'm uh
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
retired uh history teacher of 35 years
 
03:57:25.189 --> 03:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
i value succinctness in the classroom so
 
03:57:26.630 --> 03:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
i'm going to uh
 
03:57:28.469 --> 03:57:28.479 align:start position:0%
skip most of this and i think just make
 
03:57:30.950 --> 03:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
a point that's been touched upon but
 
03:57:33.030 --> 03:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's important so let me just
 
03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
refer to one paragraph and i will be
 
03:57:34.880 --> 03:57:36.550 align:start position:0%
refer to one paragraph and i will be
done

03:57:36.550 --> 03:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:57:38.309 --> 03:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
i can speak to across the country we
 
03:57:40.630 --> 03:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
have an educational crisis
 
03:57:42.790 --> 03:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
right covid
 
03:57:42.800 --> 03:57:43.830 align:start position:0%
right covid
is

03:57:43.830 --> 03:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:57:46.150 --> 03:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
creating an almost an epidemic of
 
03:57:46.160 --> 03:57:47.510 align:start position:0%
creating an almost an epidemic of
teachers

03:57:47.510 --> 03:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
03:57:50.469 --> 03:57:50.479 align:start position:0%
being burnt out and retiring or choosing
 
03:57:52.389 --> 03:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
other professions
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
and this bill is written will exacerbate

04:30:50.790 --> 04:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it was the teacher at
 
04:30:52.229 --> 04:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
the end or a couple of
 
04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
ones before me but someone said and i
 
04:30:54.800 --> 04:31:08.309 align:start position:0%
ones before me but someone said and i
know

04:31:08.309 --> 04:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:37.830 --> 04:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:37.840 --> 04:32:19.189 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:21.269 --> 04:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
you know and yeah analyze it and all
 
04:32:22.550 --> 04:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff
 
04:32:23.830 --> 04:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
because that's
 
04:32:25.990 --> 04:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
more education
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:44.389 --> 04:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:44.399 --> 04:32:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:32:57.030 --> 04:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:59.189 --> 04:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
and making children
 
04:32:59.199 --> 04:33:00.550 align:start position:0%
and making children
despair

04:33:00.550 --> 04:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
despair
 
04:33:00.560 --> 04:33:18.869 align:start position:0%
despair
based

04:33:18.869 --> 04:33:18.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:20.709 --> 04:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
i think it's more that we should be
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
taking on
 
04:33:24.390 --> 04:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
again those powerful people like i feel
 
04:33:26.789 --> 04:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
like the teachers who are
 
04:33:28.230 --> 04:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
as a result of the culture we're
 
04:33:28.240 --> 04:33:43.349 align:start position:0%
as a result of the culture we're
creating

04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:44.949 --> 04:33:44.959 align:start position:0%
we have to fight and that's because
 
04:33:47.189 --> 04:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
everyone feels this sort of
 
04:33:49.109 --> 04:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no help happening
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
from these legislators
 
04:33:52.949 --> 04:33:52.959 align:start position:0%
everyone has to be their own health and
 
04:33:52.959 --> 04:33:53.990 align:start position:0%
everyone has to be their own health and
then

04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
that bleeds into your job that leads
 
04:33:57.670 --> 04:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
into your life and then however
 
04:33:59.349 --> 04:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
passionate you are about these issues
 
04:34:01.750 --> 04:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
you can't fight it's not 2007 anymore
 
04:34:02.949 --> 04:34:02.959 align:start position:0%
you have to be able to bite your tongue
 
04:34:05.429 --> 04:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
and be like okay here's math and it's a
 
04:34:07.990 --> 04:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
little bit hard for teachers who feel so
 
04:34:09.429 --> 04:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
wrapped up in this
 
04:34:24.390 --> 04:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:37.830 --> 04:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:40.150 --> 04:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly difficult for them to do
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:16.879 --> 04:35:18.310 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:35:18.310 --> 04:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:35:18.320 --> 04:35:19.189 align:start position:0%
the
real

04:35:19.189 --> 04:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
real
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:37.670 --> 04:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:37.680 --> 04:36:26.869 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:36:26.869 --> 04:36:26.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:29.429 --> 04:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
yeah well i i think part of it too is
 
04:36:32.629 --> 04:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
that a lot of historians are likely
 
04:36:34.949 --> 04:36:34.959 align:start position:0%
taking issue with that claim
 
04:36:36.470 --> 04:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
more because
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
in a lot of ways there's there is a
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
cardinality there and i can understand
 
04:36:43.510 --> 04:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between the
 
04:36:46.070 --> 04:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
ideological foundations of the country
 
04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
and the structural foundations of the
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
country it's very hard to argue with the
 
04:37:13.429 --> 04:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:13.439 --> 04:37:38.869 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:44.470 --> 04:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:44.480 --> 04:37:56.629 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:59.089 --> 04:37:59.099 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:37:59.099 --> 04:38:36.949 align:start position:0%
all right

04:43:09.270 --> 04:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
i will fill out the pink card

04:43:15.270 --> 04:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay my name is representative alicia
 
04:43:19.510 --> 04:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
lucas i represent hudson and pelham
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be real brief on this
 
04:43:23.350 --> 04:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
because this is basically
 
04:43:26.070 --> 04:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
a very simple idea
 
04:43:28.708 --> 04:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
we spent a long time
 
04:43:31.110 --> 04:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
and the school boards association and
 
04:43:33.190 --> 04:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
the school teachers and everybody spent
 
04:43:35.990 --> 04:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
a long time coming up with
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
the uh professional code of
 
04:43:40.708 --> 04:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
the code of ethics and the professional
 
04:43:43.510 --> 04:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
code of conduct but what we've learned
 
04:43:45.860 --> 04:43:45.870 align:start position:0%
through many years is if you have
 
04:43:45.870 --> 04:43:47.350 align:start position:0%
through many years is if you have
[Music]

04:43:47.350 --> 04:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:43:50.070 --> 04:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
something that has no teeth a lot of
 
04:43:53.270 --> 04:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
people ignore it and so all this bill is
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
about is putting a little teeth behind
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
it that says
 
04:43:59.110 --> 04:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
if you don't follow your own
 
04:44:01.590 --> 04:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
professional code of conduct and code of
 
04:44:01.600 --> 04:44:02.628 align:start position:0%
professional code of conduct and code of
ethics

04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
04:44:02.638 --> 04:44:03.670 align:start position:0%
ethics
then

04:44:03.670 --> 04:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:44:05.830 --> 04:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
and you are found guilty of it so you
 
04:44:08.470 --> 04:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
have actually violated it
 
04:44:10.230 --> 04:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
then it shall
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
shall it shall result in one of these
 
04:44:16.070 --> 04:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
three things and it would be determined
 
04:44:19.590 --> 04:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
based on you know the severity like i
 
04:44:22.310 --> 04:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
can ima cannot imagine
 
04:44:25.590 --> 04:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:28.628 --> 04:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
somebody who for instance
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
engaged in sexual
 
04:44:33.990 --> 04:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh conduct with a child would just get a
 
04:44:37.350 --> 04:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
reprimand or the other hand somebody who
 
04:44:39.990 --> 04:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
slipped up in class and inadvertently
 
04:44:42.390 --> 04:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
said something without realizing what it
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
was that they would get a revocation of
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
their license i mean it would be
 
04:44:48.470 --> 04:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
proportional to whatever it was that
 
04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
they did
 
04:44:51.910 --> 04:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
but it's just to say
 
04:44:54.868 --> 04:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
yeah if you violate this then there are
 
04:44:56.788 --> 04:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
consequences and that's it it's just to
 
04:45:00.868 --> 04:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.878 --> 04:45:02.310 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

04:45:02.310 --> 04:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:45:05.110 --> 04:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
okay i have one for you um are you aware
 
04:45:05.120 --> 04:45:06.310 align:start position:0%
okay i have one for you um are you aware
that

04:45:06.310 --> 04:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:45:06.320 --> 04:45:07.110 align:start position:0%
that
the

04:45:07.110 --> 04:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:45:08.868 --> 04:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
consequences that are in this bill are
 
04:45:11.030 --> 04:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
exactly the same consequences that are
 
04:45:13.590 --> 04:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
in the professional code of teacher
 
04:45:15.990 --> 04:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
ethics i think the difference is this
 
04:45:16.000 --> 04:45:18.948 align:start position:0%
ethics i think the difference is this
shall

04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:21.430 --> 04:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
yes the consequences are the same
 
04:45:23.590 --> 04:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
but this says shall that yeah you shall
 
04:45:26.788 --> 04:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
meet those consequences
 
04:45:28.230 --> 04:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
are there further questions yes
 
04:45:29.910 --> 04:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:45:31.360 --> 04:45:32.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
representative

04:45:32.550 --> 04:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
is where is the due process in this
 
04:45:35.520 --> 04:45:39.030 align:start position:0%
is where is the due process in this
um

04:45:39.030 --> 04:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:41.670 --> 04:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
i believe that's also in
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
04:45:45.990 --> 04:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
thing i mean i there may be somebody
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
here who can explain exactly how it
 
04:45:49.670 --> 04:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
works because i don't know how it works
 
04:45:52.390 --> 04:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
i just know that in conversation we had
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
before that we were told that there's a
 
04:45:56.788 --> 04:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
whole process
 
04:45:56.798 --> 04:45:58.310 align:start position:0%
whole process
but

04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:46:00.390 --> 04:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's already in existence and
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
so maybe somebody else can answer it
 
04:46:07.110 --> 04:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
further questions represent porter
 
04:46:08.390 --> 04:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:46:10.708 --> 04:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative um who
 
04:46:12.788 --> 04:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
was involved in in ranking these and
 
04:46:16.150 --> 04:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
giving these um titles reprimand
 
04:46:18.070 --> 04:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
suspension etc were you working with an
 
04:46:19.430 --> 04:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
organization that was helping you with
 
04:46:21.430 --> 04:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
this or was this something that was
 
04:46:23.990 --> 04:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
devised in another way as uh
 
04:46:26.070 --> 04:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative ladd said
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
um this is in the code of professional
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
code of conduct
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's already in there
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
do you know where it came from
 
04:46:37.030 --> 04:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
if you may we we have the department of
 
04:46:38.708 --> 04:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
education here but it also came as a
 
04:46:41.110 --> 04:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
result of a task force of teachers okay
 
04:46:43.350 --> 04:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
working properly with the folks from doe
 
04:46:49.670 --> 04:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
no further questions for you
 
04:46:50.958 --> 04:46:52.948 align:start position:0%
no further questions for you
representative

04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:47:02.788 --> 04:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:04.310 --> 04:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lad um members of the
 
04:47:05.830 --> 04:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
committee megan tuttle president any new
 
04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire um just a quick question on
 
04:47:10.708 --> 04:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
this i guess um
 
04:47:12.150 --> 04:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
and we're not against the kodokana code
 
04:47:13.590 --> 04:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
of ethics we were any new hampshire was
 
04:47:15.510 --> 04:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
part of the crafting of this and so
 
04:47:17.190 --> 04:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
we're fully aware of what it is and we
 
04:47:19.590 --> 04:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
fully do support that we should have it
 
04:47:20.868 --> 04:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
we're just wondering why it needs to be
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
put into law if they're already in the
 
04:47:23.040 --> 04:47:24.070 align:start position:0%
put into law if they're already in the
rules

04:47:24.070 --> 04:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:47:25.510 --> 04:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
administrative rules carry the weight of
 
04:47:28.390 --> 04:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
law i believe and we heard this morning
 
04:47:29.830 --> 04:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
the good thing about the rules though is
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
there is some flexibility from chairman
 
04:47:31.520 --> 04:47:32.788 align:start position:0%
there is some flexibility from chairman
klein

04:47:32.788 --> 04:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
klein
 
04:47:32.798 --> 04:47:33.830 align:start position:0%
klein
so

04:47:33.830 --> 04:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:47:35.510 --> 04:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
i guess we're just wondering
 
04:47:37.510 --> 04:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know why we needed to do this there
 
04:47:38.868 --> 04:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
was a law that was passed to tell the
 
04:47:40.230 --> 04:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
state board of education to create this
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
code of conduct that was done um
 
04:47:44.470 --> 04:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
not really sure why it needs to be put
 
04:47:46.230 --> 04:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
into life it's already there
 
04:47:47.270 --> 04:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
are there
 
04:47:51.510 --> 04:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
any questions or from the committee here
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
we do have uh
 
04:47:55.830 --> 04:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
coming up right now the doe
 
04:47:58.550 --> 04:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
um so uh i'm good
 
04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
megan you're good okay
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:10.948 --> 04:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is diana fenton
 
04:48:12.310 --> 04:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
i'm an attorney with the department of
 
04:48:14.788 --> 04:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
education are you a senator or rep today
 
04:48:16.470 --> 04:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
i haven't decided
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
i haven't decided you cut the lunch
 
04:48:19.590 --> 04:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
break short so i'm leaning towards
 
04:48:22.150 --> 04:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
senator a little bit
 
04:48:23.990 --> 04:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you very much for having
 
04:48:25.990 --> 04:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
me i'm happy to take any questions as it
 
04:48:29.350 --> 04:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
pertains to house bill 1333 or 1336
 
04:48:31.190 --> 04:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
rather um
 
04:48:33.510 --> 04:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
i think historically it is important to
 
04:48:35.910 --> 04:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
note that um due to legislation that was
 
04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
passed uh the code of conduct was
 
04:48:41.590 --> 04:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
created by a task force department of
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
education worked very closely with its
 
04:48:43.280 --> 04:48:44.310 align:start position:0%
education worked very closely with its
partners

04:48:44.310 --> 04:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
partners
 
04:48:46.948 --> 04:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
nea aft school boards association
 
04:48:48.948 --> 04:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
superintendents association
 
04:48:51.510 --> 04:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
um it started out as a task force on the
 
04:48:54.550 --> 04:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
code of ethics and that was a
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner's task force and then as
 
04:48:59.350 --> 04:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
the legislation um that representative
 
04:49:01.110 --> 04:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
ladd put forward was working its way
 
04:49:03.990 --> 04:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
through the system the task force uh
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
finish its work on the code of ethics
 
04:49:08.550 --> 04:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
and then did a pivot to address the
 
04:49:10.708 --> 04:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
legislation that was passed and adopted
 
04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
into law
 
04:49:15.510 --> 04:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
to create the code of conduct but part
 
04:49:17.510 --> 04:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
and parcel with the code of conduct the
 
04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
department recognized that we had to
 
04:49:19.520 --> 04:49:20.470 align:start position:0%
department recognized that we had to
have

04:49:20.470 --> 04:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:49:23.910 --> 04:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures by which to
 
04:49:27.350 --> 04:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
enact the code of conduct anytime you
 
04:49:29.190 --> 04:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
put a code of conduct on a profession
 
04:49:31.670 --> 04:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
any profession you have to have a system
 
04:49:34.830 --> 04:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
by which it is administered and so the
 
04:49:38.948 --> 04:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
511s deal with that process piece the
 
04:49:41.750 --> 04:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
510s are the code of conduct and the
 
04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
department has printed
 
04:49:44.948 --> 04:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
those are available on our website and
 
04:49:47.350 --> 04:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
we've printed booklets of those
 
04:49:48.788 --> 04:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
and those are available those are the
 
04:49:51.590 --> 04:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
five tens but the content and the
 
04:49:54.628 --> 04:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
process piece which as a as an attorney
 
04:49:56.470 --> 04:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
i think is the most important piece are
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
in the 511s
 
04:50:00.230 --> 04:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that um
 
04:50:02.070 --> 04:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
these three sanctions
 
04:50:04.948 --> 04:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
are set out in the 511s these three
 
04:50:04.958 --> 04:50:05.990 align:start position:0%
are set out in the 511s these three
sanctions

04:50:05.990 --> 04:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
sanctions
 
04:50:08.788 --> 04:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
are what the department um
 
04:50:12.230 --> 04:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
administers when there is a finding
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
of a violation of the code of conduct
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
those cases are not done on an island
 
04:50:20.948 --> 04:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
and they're not done in a vacuum they
 
04:50:21.990 --> 04:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
are done
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
with myself
 
04:50:25.590 --> 04:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
as i oversee educator misconduct
 
04:50:28.390 --> 04:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
investigations with the investigator for
 
04:50:29.910 --> 04:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
the department
 
04:50:31.590 --> 04:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and the deputy
 
04:50:31.600 --> 04:50:32.470 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and the deputy
commissioner

04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:50:32.480 --> 04:50:33.510 align:start position:0%
commissioner
so

04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:35.830 --> 04:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
we decide these cases once we have all
 
04:50:37.110 --> 04:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
the facts and there's been a
 
04:50:39.430 --> 04:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
determination we will talk about what
 
04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
the appropriate sanction is but it's
 
04:50:44.070 --> 04:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
also really important to um
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
to note that the department and i've
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
said this to um
 
04:50:49.750 --> 04:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and the deputy
 
04:50:49.760 --> 04:50:51.430 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and the deputy
commissioner

04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:50:53.590 --> 04:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
very much uh all the time probably i
 
04:50:55.590 --> 04:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
have said to them the department is held
 
04:50:57.270 --> 04:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
to its precedence
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
anything we do in this particular case
 
04:51:01.030 --> 04:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
we will be held accountable to it in
 
04:51:03.110 --> 04:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
another case because our actions are not
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
and cannot be arbitrary it is not
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
targeted towards the individual it is
 
04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
targeted towards the action and so if we
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
are to
 
04:51:11.040 --> 04:51:11.830 align:start position:0%
are to
uh

04:51:11.830 --> 04:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:51:14.470 --> 04:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
impose a revocation for certain conduct
 
04:51:16.948 --> 04:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
then we use that case as a guiding
 
04:51:18.868 --> 04:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
principle for future cases and i think
 
04:51:21.590 --> 04:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's really important to recognize
 
04:51:23.910 --> 04:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelia
 
04:51:28.150 --> 04:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for being here again
 
04:51:30.628 --> 04:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
or still i don't know um
 
04:51:33.510 --> 04:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh how has the code played out in
 
04:51:37.030 --> 04:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
practice since it was uh first uh
 
04:51:37.040 --> 04:51:38.310 align:start position:0%
practice since it was uh first uh
implemented

04:51:38.310 --> 04:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:44.310 --> 04:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
the code
 
04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
in in my opinion and speaking on behalf
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
of the department um
 
04:51:51.430 --> 04:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think the code has had a lot of
 
04:51:54.550 --> 04:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
success um in a number of ways i think
 
04:51:57.510 --> 04:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
recognizing that educator misconduct is
 
04:51:59.590 --> 04:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
not a local issue
 
04:52:01.990 --> 04:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
it is a statewide issue because if there
 
04:52:04.230 --> 04:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
is someone harming children that is a
 
04:52:06.150 --> 04:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
statewide issue that is not a local
 
04:52:08.070 --> 04:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
issue and we cannot have a local control
 
04:52:10.390 --> 04:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
solution fix the statewide problem and
 
04:52:12.150 --> 04:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
so we've really had the opportunity to
 
04:52:13.830 --> 04:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
work with our districts work with our
 
04:52:16.470 --> 04:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
partners and and have kind of a hand in
 
04:52:18.628 --> 04:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
glove approach and i think the districts
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the support in these cases
 
04:52:24.628 --> 04:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
most notably we had a case
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
right here in concord um where the code
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
of conduct was instrumental in
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
identifying someone who was dangerous
 
04:52:32.470 --> 04:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
around children and that person was
 
04:52:35.350 --> 04:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
arrested for those those crimes um
 
04:52:37.590 --> 04:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
criminally and it was a significant case
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
and it was one of the first cases right
 
04:52:40.708 --> 04:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
out of the gate but that is not to
 
04:52:42.070 --> 04:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
diminish the other cases that the
 
04:52:44.550 --> 04:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
department has worked on uh which are of
 
04:52:46.868 --> 04:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
equal importance and value although they
 
04:52:51.110 --> 04:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:53.830 --> 04:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
yes represent tanner
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i actually have two issues one
 
04:52:57.670 --> 04:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
one was my question i asked
 
04:52:59.830 --> 04:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative lakers um
 
04:53:01.990 --> 04:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
what what is the due process and does
 
04:53:04.628 --> 04:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
the person that's charged actually get
 
04:53:06.788 --> 04:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
the ability to bring in an attorney like
 
04:53:06.798 --> 04:53:07.670 align:start position:0%
the ability to bring in an attorney like
you

04:53:07.670 --> 04:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:53:08.948 --> 04:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
you probably can't bring in me because
 
04:53:12.868 --> 04:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be that would
 
04:53:14.708 --> 04:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
be a conflict but uh i appreciate the
 
04:53:17.190 --> 04:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
question so the the due process is set
 
04:53:19.030 --> 04:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
out in the 511s and i appreciate the
 
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
question um
 
04:53:22.150 --> 04:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
because that was
 
04:53:24.070 --> 04:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
fundamental in the success of the of the
 
04:53:27.030 --> 04:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
implementation of the code of conduct so
 
04:53:28.708 --> 04:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
a couple of things as it pertains to the
 
04:53:29.990 --> 04:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
due process
 
04:53:30.000 --> 04:53:30.788 align:start position:0%
due process
um

04:53:30.788 --> 04:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:32.868 --> 04:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
if someone is placed under investigation
 
04:53:34.550 --> 04:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
by the department of education
 
04:53:37.110 --> 04:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
that term investigation is a it is a
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
term of art and so that person is
 
04:53:41.590 --> 04:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
notified via certified mail
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
and the superintendent of the district
 
04:53:45.910 --> 04:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
of employment is also notified just via
 
04:53:48.628 --> 04:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
regular mail and we also send
 
04:53:51.270 --> 04:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
a copy of the letter to the union
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's nea or aft we actually have
 
04:53:55.670 --> 04:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
a very close working relationship with
 
04:53:55.680 --> 04:53:57.190 align:start position:0%
a very close working relationship with
nea

04:53:57.190 --> 04:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
nea
 
04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
on these cases
 
04:54:00.788 --> 04:54:00.798 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:54:03.030 --> 04:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
everyone is notified and within that
 
04:54:05.830 --> 04:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
letter we tell that individual this is
 
04:54:07.510 --> 04:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
the allegation
 
04:54:09.510 --> 04:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
um we tell them the provision of the
 
04:54:10.868 --> 04:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
code that is alleged to have been
 
04:54:12.470 --> 04:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
violated and we give them a factual
 
04:54:13.990 --> 04:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
basis for it
 
04:54:14.000 --> 04:54:14.948 align:start position:0%
basis for it
um

04:54:14.948 --> 04:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:16.470 --> 04:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
and so then that
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
starts our process we will then be
 
04:54:20.628 --> 04:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
notified i'll use nea as an example um
 
04:54:23.110 --> 04:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
because we just work with them so much
 
04:54:25.030 --> 04:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh nea will then send us a letter
 
04:54:26.150 --> 04:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
telling us
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh this is the attorney who represents
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
them you're not to have any further
 
04:54:30.470 --> 04:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
contact with
 
04:54:33.270 --> 04:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
our client and we work exclusively with
 
04:54:36.788 --> 04:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
the attorney for the union um
 
04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
we will do our fact finding or we
 
04:54:40.470 --> 04:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
receive a report from the district it
 
04:54:42.708 --> 04:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
just depends on the circumstances of the
 
04:54:42.718 --> 04:54:43.590 align:start position:0%
just depends on the circumstances of the
case

04:54:43.590 --> 04:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:54:45.030 --> 04:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
and then we will
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
have that discussion with the union to
 
04:54:46.798 --> 04:54:47.750 align:start position:0%
have that discussion with the union to
say

04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
these are these are the facts that we
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
can prove um this is where we come down
 
04:54:54.310 --> 04:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
on this particular case
 
04:54:55.910 --> 04:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
the person has a right to challenge that
 
04:54:59.030 --> 04:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
we have had cases go to a hearing
 
04:55:00.868 --> 04:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
and it is overseen by a hearing officer
 
04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
and then we had a case recently get
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
challenged to the state board um and so
 
04:55:07.350 --> 04:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
that's where you're finding those those
 
04:55:09.830 --> 04:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
pieces of due process um
 
04:55:09.840 --> 04:55:10.788 align:start position:0%
pieces of due process um
as

04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:55:12.390 --> 04:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
discipline which is
 
04:55:15.670 --> 04:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
handed out
 
04:55:18.230 --> 04:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
what i um take great pride in is
 
04:55:20.948 --> 04:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
everything is documented and so a letter
 
04:55:23.110 --> 04:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
of reprimand is written out and it says
 
04:55:24.550 --> 04:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what
 
04:55:27.750 --> 04:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
what the reprimand is what it's for um
 
04:55:29.590 --> 04:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
how long it's on file for same with the
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
suspension and revocation everything's
 
04:55:33.510 --> 04:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
listed out and then it's signed by all
 
04:55:35.110 --> 04:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
the relevant parties
 
04:55:36.550 --> 04:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
nothing is done
 
04:55:39.190 --> 04:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh in secret and that was a really big
 
04:55:40.948 --> 04:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
push by the department is just
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
transparency with the field of what the
 
04:55:45.110 --> 04:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
expectations are and then how the
 
04:55:47.110 --> 04:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
department will respond if there is an
 
04:55:48.550 --> 04:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
alleged violation
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
04:55:51.840 --> 04:55:52.708 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
so

04:55:52.708 --> 04:55:52.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:55:54.788 --> 04:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh does this
 
04:55:56.948 --> 04:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
how does this affect
 
04:56:00.150 --> 04:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
people who are teaching
 
04:56:00.160 --> 04:56:02.230 align:start position:0%
people who are teaching
educating

04:56:02.230 --> 04:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
educating
 
04:56:04.070 --> 04:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
who are not
 
04:56:06.628 --> 04:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
credentialed so we have charter schools
 
04:56:07.910 --> 04:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
where half the people are not
 
04:56:10.390 --> 04:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
credentialed we we are giving money
 
04:56:12.310 --> 04:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
public money to non-public schools
 
04:56:14.390 --> 04:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
religious schools
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
educational vendors like prenda
 
04:56:19.270 --> 04:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
and we have a number of teachers who are
 
04:56:21.670 --> 04:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
not in union schools
 
04:56:21.680 --> 04:56:22.948 align:start position:0%
not in union schools
so

04:56:22.948 --> 04:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:26.948 --> 04:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
how does this affect them and
 
04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
in the realm of due process and
 
04:56:31.270 --> 04:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
notification or does the ethics not
 
04:56:32.788 --> 04:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
affect them because you you don't have
 
04:56:34.788 --> 04:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
any jurisdiction over them
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
so the code the code of ethics is
 
04:56:39.670 --> 04:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
not actionable
 
04:56:41.430 --> 04:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
in the sense of what we're talking about
 
04:56:43.510 --> 04:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
here the code of ethics is aspirational
 
04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
and language
 
04:56:47.190 --> 04:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
and it applies to all educational
 
04:56:49.270 --> 04:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
personnel whether they are credentialed
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
by the department of ed or they're not
 
04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the code of conduct
 
04:56:54.948 --> 04:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
however the code of conduct is
 
04:56:57.510 --> 04:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
actionable and it is only actionable
 
04:56:59.590 --> 04:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
upon a credential
 
04:57:01.990 --> 04:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
and so that is limited in scope to
 
04:57:03.270 --> 04:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
people who are licensed by the
 
04:57:06.310 --> 04:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
department of education to teach
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
as a fellow
 
04:57:07.680 --> 04:57:08.470 align:start position:0%
as a fellow
yes

04:57:08.470 --> 04:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:57:08.480 --> 04:57:09.350 align:start position:0%
yes
so

04:57:09.350 --> 04:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:12.628 --> 04:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh if if somebody for example in
 
04:57:15.990 --> 04:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
a charter school who is not credentialed
 
04:57:19.270 --> 04:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
commits a violation of the ethics part
 
04:57:20.150 --> 04:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
of it
 
04:57:22.708 --> 04:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
uh is recognized as or reported or
 
04:57:24.550 --> 04:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
however that
 
04:57:27.750 --> 04:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
goes along um what is it can does the
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
department do anything about it or are
 
04:57:32.310 --> 04:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
they just uh get out of free get out of
 
04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
jail free card
 
04:57:36.310 --> 04:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh well i'm going to clarify your
 
04:57:38.390 --> 04:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
question a little bit so
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the code of ethics
 
04:57:42.550 --> 04:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
code of ethics again is not actionable
 
04:57:44.230 --> 04:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's credentialed or
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
non-credentialed individual but if we
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
got a call from a charter school which
 
04:57:51.030 --> 04:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
we do because um last session i believe
 
04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
it was representative cordelie's bill
 
04:57:54.868 --> 04:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
made the code of conduct applicable to
 
04:57:57.510 --> 04:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
charter schools and so we are working
 
04:57:59.190 --> 04:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
with charter schools
 
04:58:01.270 --> 04:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
on the code of conduct
 
04:58:03.270 --> 04:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
but if we have an individual who is not
 
04:58:05.190 --> 04:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
credentialed by the department of
 
04:58:06.628 --> 04:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
education and there is a violation of
 
04:58:10.788 --> 04:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't have any action
 
04:58:15.190 --> 04:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
that it can take if there is not a
 
04:58:15.200 --> 04:58:16.390 align:start position:0%
that it can take if there is not a
credential

04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
credential
 
04:58:18.788 --> 04:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
uh for that individual
 
04:58:20.788 --> 04:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
there's no direct action
 
04:58:23.030 --> 04:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
it falls outside of our jurisdiction and
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
we have that issue even notwithstanding
 
04:58:27.270 --> 04:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
charter schools we have that issue with
 
04:58:30.550 --> 04:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
pair educators who some are credentialed
 
04:58:33.110 --> 04:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
some are not and so when we receive a
 
04:58:35.910 --> 04:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
call of a report one of our questions is
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
is this individual
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
credentialed or not it's just part of
 
04:58:41.270 --> 04:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
our vetting process
 
04:58:43.190 --> 04:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
we have that whether or not it's with a
 
04:58:45.190 --> 04:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
charter school or not doesn't doesn't
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
that leave a lot of students
 
04:58:52.868 --> 04:58:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:52.878 --> 04:58:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
possibly

04:58:53.990 --> 04:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
04:58:55.110 --> 04:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
at risk
 
04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know your your question calls for a
 
04:58:59.590 --> 04:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
number and it's hard to quantify i can't
 
04:59:02.310 --> 04:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
provide a number um what i can tell you
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
is that the code of conduct
 
04:59:06.390 --> 04:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
was written to
 
04:59:09.350 --> 04:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
attach to the license just like my
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
license to practice law um if you're an
 
04:59:14.788 --> 04:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
attorney who never passed the bar or
 
04:59:16.390 --> 04:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
didn't take the bar
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
the presumably the new hampshire
 
04:59:21.670 --> 04:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
bar association doesn't have any direct
 
04:59:23.430 --> 04:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
access to your license because you don't
 
04:59:24.948 --> 04:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
have one
 
04:59:26.550 --> 04:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
so what i can tell you is the
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
department's jurisdiction as it pertains
 
04:59:30.948 --> 04:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
to the code of conduct is limited to
 
04:59:33.190 --> 04:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
those individuals who have a credential
 
04:59:34.230 --> 04:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
to teach
 
04:59:36.070 --> 04:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up so
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
so a lawyer who doesn't pass the bar
 
04:59:41.110 --> 04:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't get to practice law
 
04:59:41.120 --> 04:59:42.390 align:start position:0%
doesn't get to practice law
but

04:59:42.390 --> 04:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:59:43.910 --> 04:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
a person who thinks that they're
 
04:59:46.230 --> 04:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
educated enough to teach or has been
 
04:59:49.590 --> 04:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:51.990 --> 04:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
can teach they teach right beside people
 
04:59:53.510 --> 04:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
who are credentialed
 
04:59:55.510 --> 04:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
in charter schools they're right beside
 
04:59:57.910 --> 04:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
them and get the probably the same
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
amount of money the same amount of
 
05:00:02.948 --> 05:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
um respect the same amount of
 
05:00:05.910 --> 05:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know gravitas of the job of being a
 
05:00:07.190 --> 05:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
teacher so
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
uh and probably half the people
 
05:00:12.788 --> 05:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
students going to the school or parents
 
05:00:14.070 --> 05:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
that are sending their kids to the
 
05:00:15.590 --> 05:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
school don't know
 
05:00:17.190 --> 05:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
which ones are credentialed and which
 
05:00:19.430 --> 05:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
ones aren't so if they're in that
 
05:00:21.270 --> 05:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
equalized position
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
and yet haven't gone through the
 
05:00:23.120 --> 05:00:24.310 align:start position:0%
and yet haven't gone through the
professional

05:00:24.310 --> 05:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
professional
 
05:00:26.948 --> 05:00:26.958 align:start position:0%
credentialing for the job which is
 
05:00:28.708 --> 05:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
you know a lawyer couldn't do that right
 
05:00:30.310 --> 05:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
lawyer couldn't stand in front of the
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
court and argue a case
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
without a
 
05:00:34.868 --> 05:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
without a
 
05:00:35.830 --> 05:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
professional certificate so
 
05:00:39.910 --> 05:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
um what i'm saying is
 
05:00:41.750 --> 05:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
the reason that they can't or you can't
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
practice medicine unless you have a
 
05:00:43.680 --> 05:00:44.708 align:start position:0%
practice medicine unless you have a
degree

05:00:44.708 --> 05:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
degree
 
05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
05:00:49.430 --> 05:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't that put students i'm not asking
 
05:00:51.270 --> 05:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
for a number i'm just saying doesn't
 
05:00:53.830 --> 05:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
that leave a big gaping hole
 
05:00:55.750 --> 05:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:03.670 --> 05:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
subject to uh violations of the code of
 
05:01:08.868 --> 05:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:11.190 --> 05:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
i well i'll give you the classic lawyer
 
05:01:12.628 --> 05:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
answer since i
 
05:01:15.270 --> 05:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
since i am licensed to stand in front of
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
a court and argue uh it depends
 
05:01:20.550 --> 05:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
um i went to a lot of education to learn
 
05:01:21.750 --> 05:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
that phrase
 
05:01:25.910 --> 05:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
and paid a lot of money for it too um
 
05:01:28.550 --> 05:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
it does depend but i i want to recognize
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
that there was a bill passed last
 
05:01:31.990 --> 05:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
session which made the code of conduct
 
05:01:34.230 --> 05:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
applicable to charter schools regardless
 
05:01:36.788 --> 05:01:36.798 align:start position:0%
of the status of the individual
 
05:01:38.868 --> 05:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
who was teaching and i think that is a
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
significant step forward what i will
 
05:01:42.830 --> 05:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
again reiterate
 
05:01:42.840 --> 05:01:44.550 align:start position:0%
again reiterate
um

05:01:44.550 --> 05:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:47.590 --> 05:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
is simply the department has that that
 
05:01:50.310 --> 05:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction uh to just oversee
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
credentialed educators and i think
 
05:01:54.628 --> 05:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
reasonable minds can differ as to the
 
05:01:56.628 --> 05:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
value of that
 
05:01:56.638 --> 05:01:57.670 align:start position:0%
value of that
however

05:01:57.670 --> 05:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:02:00.070 --> 05:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
we do have this new law that was passed
 
05:02:01.590 --> 05:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
which we are now working with our
 
05:02:02.788 --> 05:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
charter schools and i think that is the
 
05:02:04.470 --> 05:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
significance do you mean the charter
 
05:02:05.990 --> 05:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
schools are held to the code of conduct
 
05:02:07.510 --> 05:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
another question this is getting to be a
 
05:02:07.520 --> 05:02:09.190 align:start position:0%
another question this is getting to be a
one-way

05:02:09.190 --> 05:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
one-way
 
05:02:11.270 --> 05:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify because she said
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
the law said that they're held to the
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
code of conduct is that
 
05:02:16.708 --> 05:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
05:02:18.788 --> 05:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
so the code the the code of conduct is
 
05:02:20.788 --> 05:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
now applicable to charter schools and i
 
05:02:23.110 --> 05:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that that's okay
 
05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
05:02:25.350 --> 05:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative walsh do you have a
 
05:02:28.070 --> 05:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
question i do mr chairman i have a quick
 
05:02:30.230 --> 05:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
question um i spent five years on the
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
guardian and lighting board when they
 
05:02:33.030 --> 05:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
were doing their rulemaking and one of
 
05:02:35.350 --> 05:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
the things that we did is we do not make
 
05:02:37.270 --> 05:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
complaints public until they're founded
 
05:02:38.708 --> 05:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
because there were a good number of
 
05:02:40.390 --> 05:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
unfounded allegations i think the bar
 
05:02:42.390 --> 05:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
does the same thing my question is is
 
05:02:43.590 --> 05:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
when there's a complaint against the
 
05:02:45.190 --> 05:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
code of conduct is that immediately
 
05:02:47.190 --> 05:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
public or only when there's a finding of
 
05:02:47.200 --> 05:02:48.070 align:start position:0%
public or only when there's a finding of
cause

05:02:48.070 --> 05:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
cause
 
05:02:50.230 --> 05:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and we follow
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
very similar rules uh so if someone is
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
under investigation and again that is a
 
05:02:56.310 --> 05:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
term of art within the department of
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
education found within our rules 511s um
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
that is not public information and we
 
05:03:05.110 --> 05:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
have had press inquiries of individuals
 
05:03:06.948 --> 05:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
um and the department has said that
 
05:03:09.030 --> 05:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's just not public information
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
across the board um however if there is
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
a finding
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
for revocation or suspension and i will
 
05:03:18.628 --> 05:03:18.638 align:start position:0%
go back to the idea of that
 
05:03:21.110 --> 05:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
documentation where the individual and
 
05:03:23.030 --> 05:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
their union lawyer both sign that
 
05:03:26.070 --> 05:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
document as does the department of ed
 
05:03:28.628 --> 05:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
um if someone has a suspension or
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
revocation they were then placed on the
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
the list the department's revoked and
 
05:03:35.830 --> 05:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
suspended educator list and that
 
05:03:38.150 --> 05:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
information is public
 
05:03:40.150 --> 05:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
we will provide that upon request and we
 
05:03:42.230 --> 05:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
provide it to school districts
 
05:03:43.830 --> 05:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis to help them with
 
05:03:46.150 --> 05:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
their hiring decisions and they have
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
requested that
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
so and then the reprimands are
 
05:03:50.638 --> 05:03:53.270 align:start position:0%
so and then the reprimands are
private

05:03:53.270 --> 05:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:56.230 --> 05:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh i have one question to ask you uh
 
05:03:58.230 --> 05:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
although the code of ethics which is
 
05:04:00.310 --> 05:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
aspirational as you've mentioned
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh is uh in relation to uh relationships
 
05:04:06.310 --> 05:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
with community parents
 
05:04:06.320 --> 05:04:07.670 align:start position:0%
with community parents
students

05:04:07.670 --> 05:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:04:09.990 --> 05:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh use of technology there's those
 
05:04:12.390 --> 05:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
categorical areas within the code of
 
05:04:12.400 --> 05:04:13.430 align:start position:0%
categorical areas within the code of
ethics

05:04:13.430 --> 05:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
05:04:16.470 --> 05:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the application of this
 
05:04:19.750 --> 05:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
through the code of conduct
 
05:04:21.030 --> 05:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
could you please
 
05:04:22.948 --> 05:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
explain for those on the committee may
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
not be aware
 
05:04:26.390 --> 05:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
is that involve administrators and
 
05:04:29.190 --> 05:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
principals paraprofessionals etc that
 
05:04:31.830 --> 05:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
have this certification because under
 
05:04:33.750 --> 05:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
certification law
 
05:04:36.948 --> 05:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
a principal is considered a teacher
 
05:04:39.830 --> 05:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question so um as
 
05:04:41.590 --> 05:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
additional clarity the four principles
 
05:04:43.350 --> 05:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
that are set forth in the code of ethics
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
those were mirrored in the code of
 
05:04:47.350 --> 05:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
conduct and those were set forth in in
 
05:04:49.430 --> 05:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
the statute that was passed so you might
 
05:04:51.270 --> 05:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
see a little difference in the language
 
05:04:53.430 --> 05:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
but the the intent is the same they were
 
05:04:55.350 --> 05:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
mirrored um there is one additional
 
05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
principle in the code of conduct and
 
05:04:59.030 --> 05:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
that is the duty to report
 
05:05:00.390 --> 05:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
that you will not find in the code of
 
05:05:02.868 --> 05:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
ethics and the code of conduct is again
 
05:05:05.030 --> 05:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's applicable to all individuals who
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
hold a credential issued by the
 
05:05:07.990 --> 05:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
department of education and it is
 
05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
equally applicable to administrators
 
05:05:11.910 --> 05:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's superintendents or
 
05:05:11.920 --> 05:05:13.350 align:start position:0%
whether it's superintendents or
principals

05:05:13.350 --> 05:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
principals
 
05:05:15.270 --> 05:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
and the department
 
05:05:15.280 --> 05:05:16.230 align:start position:0%
and the department
has

05:05:16.230 --> 05:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
has
 
05:05:18.070 --> 05:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
taken action across the board when it's
 
05:05:18.080 --> 05:05:19.670 align:start position:0%
taken action across the board when it's
appropriate

05:05:19.670 --> 05:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:05:21.430 --> 05:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelia and
 
05:05:25.030 --> 05:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
05:05:28.948 --> 05:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
05:05:28.958 --> 05:05:29.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
just

05:05:29.910 --> 05:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
if i want to be clear
 
05:05:34.070 --> 05:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
you're talking about actionable in terms
 
05:05:34.080 --> 05:05:35.110 align:start position:0%
you're talking about actionable in terms
of

05:05:35.110 --> 05:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
the ability of the department to take
 
05:05:37.920 --> 05:05:38.948 align:start position:0%
the ability of the department to take
action

05:05:38.948 --> 05:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
action
 
05:05:41.590 --> 05:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
but irregardless of whether someone has
 
05:05:44.150 --> 05:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
a credential or not
 
05:05:47.190 --> 05:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
they there could still be actionable
 
05:05:48.868 --> 05:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
or action taken
 
05:05:51.190 --> 05:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
within the judicial system based on the
 
05:05:51.200 --> 05:05:52.948 align:start position:0%
within the judicial system based on the
offense

05:05:52.948 --> 05:05:52.958 align:start position:0%
offense
 
05:05:55.270 --> 05:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
if yes thank you for the question if the
 
05:05:57.350 --> 05:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
matter rises the level of a criminal
 
05:05:59.990 --> 05:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
offense certainly the court system would
 
05:06:02.390 --> 05:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
would take its action but i think to
 
05:06:04.788 --> 05:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
kind of leap frog off of your question
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
um there's always the realm of
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
employment and so when you look at
 
05:06:11.510 --> 05:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
someone who might not be credentialed
 
05:06:13.270 --> 05:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
there is the employment realm and so
 
05:06:15.590 --> 05:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
that is it really is a two-tiered system
 
05:06:17.190 --> 05:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
and i go back to that hand and glove
 
05:06:17.200 --> 05:06:18.310 align:start position:0%
and i go back to that hand and glove
approach

05:06:18.310 --> 05:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
approach
 
05:06:19.910 --> 05:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
the department is relying upon the
 
05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
districts and the districts rely upon
 
05:06:23.430 --> 05:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
the department to make sure that
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
children are safe all over our state so
 
05:06:29.190 --> 05:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
the department's not able to take action
 
05:06:31.270 --> 05:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
there could be uh
 
05:06:33.750 --> 05:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate employment action at the at
 
05:06:35.590 --> 05:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
the local level at the district level
 
05:06:37.510 --> 05:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
and so that's why i always go back to
 
05:06:38.948 --> 05:06:38.958 align:start position:0%
that hand and glove approach because
 
05:06:40.628 --> 05:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
there's employment which is dealt with
 
05:06:42.230 --> 05:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
exclusively by the districts and then
 
05:06:43.910 --> 05:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
there's credentialing and that is the
 
05:06:45.830 --> 05:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
realm of the department of ed
 
05:06:47.750 --> 05:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:06:52.390 --> 05:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question attorney fenton so
 
05:06:59.750 --> 05:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:02.390 --> 05:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
to be amended
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
can you tell me if these if the
 
05:07:08.708 --> 05:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
reprimand the suspension and the uh
 
05:07:12.390 --> 05:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
revocation are already in the rules
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
what will
 
05:07:17.310 --> 05:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
codifying it in
 
05:07:20.070 --> 05:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
21n92c what will it do what will the
 
05:07:23.030 --> 05:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
effect be of
 
05:07:24.708 --> 05:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
passing this
 
05:07:26.230 --> 05:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
so the
 
05:07:26.240 --> 05:07:29.430 align:start position:0%
so the
um

05:07:29.430 --> 05:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:32.628 --> 05:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
the sanctions are already set forth
 
05:07:34.788 --> 05:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
in 11.
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
um i i will probably defer your question
 
05:07:39.350 --> 05:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
more to the sponsor as to what the
 
05:07:42.550 --> 05:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill would be um i i
 
05:07:42.560 --> 05:07:43.590 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill would be um i i
would

05:07:43.590 --> 05:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:07:46.390 --> 05:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
speculate and it's pure speculation that
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
uh it would be harder to get a repeal of
 
05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct
 
05:07:50.160 --> 05:07:51.350 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct
um

05:07:51.350 --> 05:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:53.830 --> 05:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
by putting it in the in the statute but
 
05:07:55.430 --> 05:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
again that's speculation i would defer
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
to the sponsor as to what the intent of
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
placing it in the statute would be
 
05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay i just have one follow-up mr chair
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
um it also says a violation as
 
05:08:07.990 --> 05:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
determined by the state board of
 
05:08:08.000 --> 05:08:09.510 align:start position:0%
determined by the state board of
education

05:08:09.510 --> 05:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:08:12.390 --> 05:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh are you and the commissioner and
 
05:08:15.430 --> 05:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
deputy and investigator deputized by the
 
05:08:17.350 --> 05:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
state board to
 
05:08:20.868 --> 05:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
make that determination or
 
05:08:20.878 --> 05:08:21.750 align:start position:0%
make that determination or
is

05:08:21.750 --> 05:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
chairman klein
 
05:08:26.230 --> 05:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
now going to be wearing a badge
 
05:08:26.240 --> 05:08:27.750 align:start position:0%
now going to be wearing a badge
well

05:08:27.750 --> 05:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:08:29.590 --> 05:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
what chairman klein chooses to wear is
 
05:08:34.470 --> 05:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:35.830 --> 05:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think i have any say over that
 
05:08:37.750 --> 05:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
if he'd like a badge he certainly uh he
 
05:08:39.430 --> 05:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
can have one um
 
05:08:41.510 --> 05:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not that we're deputized but
 
05:08:43.750 --> 05:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
when you look at other provisions of the
 
05:08:46.070 --> 05:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
of the education law
 
05:08:47.990 --> 05:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
outside of the code of conduct
 
05:08:49.110 --> 05:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see there's that close
 
05:08:51.270 --> 05:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
affiliation and so when you read the
 
05:08:54.150 --> 05:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
state board it is it is assumed and it
 
05:08:56.470 --> 05:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
has been interpreted to mean the
 
05:08:58.550 --> 05:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
department of education and and the
 
05:09:02.070 --> 05:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
staff and so there's not a formal deputy
 
05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
deputizing process uh although
 
05:09:08.868 --> 05:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
now i want one um but we can take care
 
05:09:11.270 --> 05:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
of that thank you i appreciate that but
 
05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's how it's always been interpreted
 
05:09:16.150 --> 05:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
are there further questions represent
 
05:09:18.868 --> 05:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
yes representative waltz
 
05:09:21.430 --> 05:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh i know and you i'm sure know too from
 
05:09:23.030 --> 05:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
law school the rules have the force and
 
05:09:25.030 --> 05:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
effect of law but could you kind of give
 
05:09:26.708 --> 05:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
a perimeter to people in this room about
 
05:09:28.788 --> 05:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
the difference between rules and laws
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
and kind of the effectiveness of them in
 
05:09:33.270 --> 05:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
the role of them
 
05:09:36.150 --> 05:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
i hope so let's see um
 
05:09:37.750 --> 05:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:09:39.670 --> 05:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's interesting
 
05:09:41.110 --> 05:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
working for the department of education
 
05:09:42.708 --> 05:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
is the first time that i've been engaged
 
05:09:44.310 --> 05:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
in that rulemaking process so it was
 
05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
certainly an eye-opening experience for
 
05:09:48.070 --> 05:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
me that's not something we have in in
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
criminal law where i where i used to
 
05:09:52.470 --> 05:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
practice so the way i explain it is this
 
05:09:54.070 --> 05:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
the statute kind of sets out the
 
05:09:56.550 --> 05:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
framework of the house if you will right
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's the foundation of the house and
 
05:10:00.628 --> 05:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
it's the the outline of the house and
 
05:10:02.708 --> 05:10:02.718 align:start position:0%
then i always think of the rules as kind
 
05:10:05.350 --> 05:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
of flushing out the interior right it's
 
05:10:08.070 --> 05:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
the tile it's the backsplashes it's the
 
05:10:09.750 --> 05:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh the curtains it's the paint on the
 
05:10:11.350 --> 05:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
walls it's things like that it's that
 
05:10:15.190 --> 05:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
detail level um and it was uh definitely
 
05:10:17.670 --> 05:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
an interesting experience uh for me to
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
engage with our stakeholders in that
 
05:10:21.670 --> 05:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
process and i think what is so unique
 
05:10:23.990 --> 05:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
about education is the work we do with
 
05:10:26.788 --> 05:10:26.798 align:start position:0%
our partners and our stakeholders um i
 
05:10:28.230 --> 05:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
can tell you
 
05:10:30.390 --> 05:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
from my past uh employment and just
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
being a lawyer i was very lone wolf and
 
05:10:35.190 --> 05:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
so this was a
 
05:10:37.030 --> 05:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
great learning experience and i think
 
05:10:38.788 --> 05:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
it's by working with our stakeholders
 
05:10:40.868 --> 05:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
and our partners that we learn all the
 
05:10:42.868 --> 05:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
different viewpoints of how what has to
 
05:10:44.230 --> 05:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
be addressed and all the various
 
05:10:46.150 --> 05:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
concerns and that's what i think the
 
05:10:48.390 --> 05:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
strength of rulemaking
 
05:10:49.750 --> 05:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
really is whether it's in this
 
05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
particular subject area or any of the
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
areas that the department oversees um
 
05:10:56.310 --> 05:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
we've had great opportunities to work
 
05:10:57.750 --> 05:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
with a number of stakeholders on that
 
05:10:59.670 --> 05:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
rule-making process the one that always
 
05:11:02.550 --> 05:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
pops to my mind is special education
 
05:11:04.070 --> 05:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
i think without our stakeholders we
 
05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
would be lost
 
05:11:07.030 --> 05:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
but that's just my
 
05:11:08.390 --> 05:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
two cents i hope that answers your
 
05:11:10.230 --> 05:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
question sufficiently
 
05:11:12.390 --> 05:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
well i was more looking to the force of
 
05:11:14.628 --> 05:11:14.638 align:start position:0%
law effect but than the how you make
 
05:11:16.628 --> 05:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
rules effect but you know
 
05:11:18.868 --> 05:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
well the to me the the force of law yes
 
05:11:20.788 --> 05:11:20.798 align:start position:0%
it does have the same um
 
05:11:23.270 --> 05:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
effect as law and that comes from the
 
05:11:25.350 --> 05:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
adoption at jail car in the back and
 
05:11:27.590 --> 05:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
forth with the um
 
05:11:27.600 --> 05:11:28.868 align:start position:0%
forth with the um
ols

05:11:28.868 --> 05:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
ols
 
05:11:32.470 --> 05:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
and then ultimately adoption by jalcar
 
05:11:42.708 --> 05:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
okay on that note are there any further
 
05:11:47.190 --> 05:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:11:49.190 --> 05:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
05:11:51.270 --> 05:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
you uh i don't think we have any more
 
05:11:52.948 --> 05:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
pink cards on this one so i'm going to
 
05:11:56.868 --> 05:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:59.270 --> 05:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and we will prepare to go into
 
05:12:01.030 --> 05:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
the next
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:07.750 --> 05:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:09.670 --> 05:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
i just don't know anywhere i put my
 
05:12:09.680 --> 05:12:12.550 align:start position:0%
i just don't know anywhere i put my
calendar

05:12:12.550 --> 05:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
sitting here somewhere what's the number
 
05:12:15.190 --> 05:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
one three
 
05:12:20.150 --> 05:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:20.160 --> 05:12:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:12:21.670 --> 05:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:23.990 --> 05:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
kind of looks like representative porter
 
05:12:27.510 --> 05:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
is the sponsor of this build
 
05:12:29.190 --> 05:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
05:12:31.190 --> 05:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
committee and i'm going to put out that
 
05:12:33.030 --> 05:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
plea this is my first time presenting a
 
05:12:37.350 --> 05:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
bill to this committee so be kind
 
05:12:39.590 --> 05:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is marjorie
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
porter i represent the good towns of
 
05:12:45.350 --> 05:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
hillsborough antrim and windsor which at
 
05:12:46.470 --> 05:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
one point
 
05:12:48.948 --> 05:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
advertise themselves as the switzerland
 
05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:54.788 --> 05:12:54.798 align:start position:0%
all during the pandemic
 
05:12:56.868 --> 05:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
schools have been forced to adapt and
 
05:12:58.628 --> 05:12:58.638 align:start position:0%
figure out ways to keep learning
 
05:12:58.638 --> 05:12:59.670 align:start position:0%
figure out ways to keep learning
happening

05:12:59.670 --> 05:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
happening
 
05:13:01.750 --> 05:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
while also keeping kids
 
05:13:03.350 --> 05:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
kids and staff
 
05:13:05.030 --> 05:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
safe and healthy
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
this has been and continues to be
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
stressful for all involved
 
05:13:12.470 --> 05:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
the governor and the state department of
 
05:13:14.868 --> 05:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
education have for the most part left
 
05:13:17.270 --> 05:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
the decisions about just how to do this
 
05:13:19.750 --> 05:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
to school districts themselves saying
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
one size fits all policies were not wise
 
05:13:25.030 --> 05:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
each district has different
 
05:13:27.350 --> 05:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances and what is needed in
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
dover might not be good for bennington
 
05:13:32.708 --> 05:13:32.718 align:start position:0%
districts needed to be flexible and
 
05:13:35.350 --> 05:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
nimble and top-down mandates would
 
05:13:36.948 --> 05:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
prevent that
 
05:13:39.030 --> 05:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
districts themselves should decide
 
05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
issues around masking for example or
 
05:13:44.310 --> 05:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
when and whether to go hybrid or fully
 
05:13:44.320 --> 05:13:46.070 align:start position:0%
when and whether to go hybrid or fully
remote

05:13:46.070 --> 05:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
remote
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's why i was surprised to learn
 
05:13:50.708 --> 05:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
about the new doe rule around the use of
 
05:13:53.510 --> 05:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
remote and hybrid learning options
 
05:13:55.990 --> 05:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
under this new rule all schools must
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
remain open in order to meet the 180 day
 
05:13:59.040 --> 05:14:00.708 align:start position:0%
remain open in order to meet the 180 day
requirement

05:14:00.708 --> 05:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:14:02.788 --> 05:14:02.798 align:start position:0%
any school going to hybrid or full
 
05:14:05.590 --> 05:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
remote due to covet outbreaks or
 
05:14:08.150 --> 05:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
absences will not receive credit for
 
05:14:10.708 --> 05:14:10.718 align:start position:0%
those days but instead must make them up
 
05:14:12.470 --> 05:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
in june
 
05:14:14.868 --> 05:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
however the use of blizzard bags on
 
05:14:18.390 --> 05:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
snowy days is still okay
 
05:14:21.270 --> 05:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
i think i'm not out of line here to say
 
05:14:24.310 --> 05:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
everyone wants to see our schools open
 
05:14:26.788 --> 05:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
and our students students and teachers
 
05:14:29.750 --> 05:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
learning together in our classrooms
 
05:14:31.670 --> 05:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
for most kids
 
05:14:34.150 --> 05:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
learning in school is simply better
 
05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
remote learning is hard on families too
 
05:14:39.750 --> 05:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
who stays home with the kids
 
05:14:42.150 --> 05:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
but in this time of covert with large
 
05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
numbers of kids and staff out sick
 
05:14:47.190 --> 05:14:47.200 align:start position:0%
with substitutes hard to find or
 
05:14:47.200 --> 05:14:48.708 align:start position:0%
with substitutes hard to find or
non-existent

05:14:48.708 --> 05:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
non-existent
 
05:14:51.350 --> 05:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
simply being in the building does not
 
05:14:53.110 --> 05:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean
 
05:14:55.750 --> 05:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
teaching and learning are happening
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
i asked some teacher friends to share
 
05:15:00.070 --> 05:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
their experiences with me and i hope you
 
05:15:02.150 --> 05:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
will indulge me while i read what they
 
05:15:02.160 --> 05:15:03.830 align:start position:0%
will indulge me while i read what they
sent

05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
sent
 
05:15:06.230 --> 05:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
there was a classroom in my school which
 
05:15:07.910 --> 05:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
developed a cluster
 
05:15:10.470 --> 05:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
the teacher had five students in class
 
05:15:13.110 --> 05:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
and the rest were home quarantining or
 
05:15:15.990 --> 05:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
having tested positive and none of them
 
05:15:18.230 --> 05:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
were receiving an education because
 
05:15:20.550 --> 05:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
remote learning wasn't an option
 
05:15:22.550 --> 05:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
the teacher did not feel as though she
 
05:15:24.948 --> 05:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
could introduce new topics with only
 
05:15:28.150 --> 05:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
five students so it was a wasted week as
 
05:15:32.788 --> 05:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
far as any new learning for all students
 
05:15:35.030 --> 05:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
as of right now the sub situation is
 
05:15:37.230 --> 05:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
bleak another said we are using
 
05:15:39.510 --> 05:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals when we can
 
05:15:41.670 --> 05:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
which means identified students aren't
 
05:15:44.868 --> 05:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
receiving their hours of support
 
05:15:47.430 --> 05:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
if we have a teacherless classroom that
 
05:15:49.430 --> 05:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
class is split among the other grade
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
level classes which has caused clusters
 
05:15:53.910 --> 05:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
under these conditions social distancing
 
05:15:58.788 --> 05:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
is nearly impossible
 
05:16:00.788 --> 05:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
all of this makes it hard to deliver
 
05:16:03.750 --> 05:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
consistent rigorous instruction we're
 
05:16:07.430 --> 05:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
just trying to make it through each day
 
05:16:08.708 --> 05:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
from another
 
05:16:11.350 --> 05:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
in my school we have absolutely no
 
05:16:11.360 --> 05:16:12.628 align:start position:0%
in my school we have absolutely no
substitutes

05:16:12.628 --> 05:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
substitutes
 
05:16:15.030 --> 05:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
they have been pulling our title one
 
05:16:17.590 --> 05:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
teachers to cover classrooms
 
05:16:20.550 --> 05:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
which then cancels their services and

these small group lessons for the

students with the most academic needs to

review skills they haven't mastered yet
 
05:16:34.948 --> 05:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
these students need consistent reading
 
05:16:37.590 --> 05:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
practice every day and they can't get it
 
05:16:39.670 --> 05:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
because the intervention teachers are

covering classrooms
 
05:16:43.750 --> 05:16:43.760 align:start position:0%

students aren't getting the education in

school they should be under these
 
05:17:13.910 --> 05:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances because of numerous
 
05:17:17.910 --> 05:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
absences related to covid
 
05:17:20.470 --> 05:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
25 to 30 percent of students are out on
 
05:17:22.868 --> 05:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
any given day another said it's not
 
05:17:25.190 --> 05:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
always the same students
 
05:17:27.270 --> 05:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
someone is always missing something that
 
05:17:28.550 --> 05:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
i present
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
i have to consistently come up with
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
alternative things for the students who
 
05:17:35.190 --> 05:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
have been in class while i make up work
 
05:17:37.350 --> 05:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
with the kids who miss something
 
05:17:39.430 --> 05:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
i now have to have two things going at
 
05:17:42.310 --> 05:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
all times regular work and makeup work
 
05:17:43.910 --> 05:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
for every concept
 
05:17:47.590 --> 05:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's a juggling act and it's exhausting
 
05:17:48.948 --> 05:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
05:17:51.190 --> 05:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
students whose teachers are out are
 
05:17:53.350 --> 05:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
directed to the auditorium
 
05:17:55.510 --> 05:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
to join the study hall
 
05:17:57.590 --> 05:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
this makes hundreds of students
 
05:17:59.670 --> 05:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
in the same room for upwards of 80
 
05:18:01.750 --> 05:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
minutes at a time
 
05:18:06.868 --> 05:18:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has forced schools and
 
05:18:10.628 --> 05:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
teachers to adapt
 
05:18:12.470 --> 05:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
most schools have the technology in
 
05:18:14.628 --> 05:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
place to allow hybrid and remote
 
05:18:16.788 --> 05:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
teaching and most teachers have learned
 
05:18:19.750 --> 05:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
skills and techniques to make it work so
 
05:18:21.670 --> 05:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
learning can occur
 
05:18:25.030 --> 05:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
it may not be perfect but i dare to say
 
05:18:27.430 --> 05:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
more learning will happen remotely than
 
05:18:29.910 --> 05:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
it will in half empty open schools or
 
05:18:33.030 --> 05:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
overcrowded cafeterias
 
05:18:35.430 --> 05:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
schools are closed on snowy days to keep
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
kids safe
 
05:18:39.190 --> 05:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
to keep kids safe
 
05:18:41.830 --> 05:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me i've left a whole bunch
 
05:18:45.030 --> 05:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
in this time of surge and covet in new
 
05:18:49.190 --> 05:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire when numbers of daily new
 
05:18:51.750 --> 05:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
cases is in the thousands when our
 
05:18:53.910 --> 05:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals are groaning under the weight
 
05:18:55.830 --> 05:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
of caring for all the ill
 
05:18:58.310 --> 05:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
ill and the number of dead keeps going
 
05:19:01.030 --> 05:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
up 26 yesterday
 
05:19:04.150 --> 05:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
going hybrid or full remote might be the
 
05:19:07.190 --> 05:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
best way to keep kids and staff safe
 
05:19:09.350 --> 05:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
it seems ill-advised to remove this
 
05:19:11.110 --> 05:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
option now
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering what will happen if
 
05:19:15.510 --> 05:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
the number of days to be made up exceed
 
05:19:17.990 --> 05:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
the number of days in june
 
05:19:21.110 --> 05:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
if indeed one size does not fit all as
 
05:19:23.430 --> 05:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
we have been told and if districts know
 
05:19:26.070 --> 05:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
what their needs are better than anyone
 
05:19:28.868 --> 05:19:28.878 align:start position:0%
at a desk in concord does then i urge
 
05:19:32.470 --> 05:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
you to consider this bill and uh and
 
05:19:34.550 --> 05:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
vote it ought to pass
 
05:19:36.150 --> 05:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and if you have questions i'll
 
05:19:39.030 --> 05:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:41.190 --> 05:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
questions for representative porter
 
05:19:43.190 --> 05:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelie
 
05:19:44.628 --> 05:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
05:19:46.470 --> 05:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
good job on your first
 
05:19:46.480 --> 05:19:49.190 align:start position:0%
good job on your first
time

05:19:49.190 --> 05:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:51.510 --> 05:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned snow days
 
05:19:54.150 --> 05:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
to keep students safe
 
05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
but aren't snow days made up also as
 
05:20:00.070 --> 05:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
remote learning days would be
 
05:20:03.190 --> 05:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
snow days can be if if a
 
05:20:05.590 --> 05:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
a school has a blizzard bags system set
 
05:20:09.030 --> 05:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
up they can send home work and work
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
together on computers at home and that
 
05:20:14.070 --> 05:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
day will not need to be made up it's my
 
05:20:18.788 --> 05:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:21.750 --> 05:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:23.190 --> 05:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
i have a
 
05:20:25.670 --> 05:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
a question to ask of you
 
05:20:28.070 --> 05:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
during the recent pandemic and it's been
 
05:20:29.750 --> 05:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
an awful period of time i agree but
 
05:20:32.708 --> 05:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
we're going into our third year
 
05:20:34.548 --> 05:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
and we're starting to notice that the
 
05:20:36.868 --> 05:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
remote learning has not been as
 
05:20:39.270 --> 05:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
successful as we would hoped it been
 
05:20:42.868 --> 05:20:42.878 align:start position:0%
we've seen math scores drop from 48
 
05:20:46.948 --> 05:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
proficiency to 38 percent proficiency
 
05:20:49.990 --> 05:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
my observation of just comparing two of
 
05:20:52.150 --> 05:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
my own grandkids
 
05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
one went to school one was on remote the
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
whole time
 
05:20:58.708 --> 05:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
the one that was in school even though
 
05:21:00.390 --> 05:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
they were dealing with the covet in that
 
05:21:00.400 --> 05:21:01.350 align:start position:0%
they were dealing with the covet in that
school

05:21:01.350 --> 05:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:21:03.030 --> 05:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
was able to
 
05:21:05.190 --> 05:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
keep the path going towards where i
 
05:21:06.788 --> 05:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
would like to see them going in terms of
 
05:21:06.798 --> 05:21:08.150 align:start position:0%
would like to see them going in terms of
learning

05:21:08.150 --> 05:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
learning
 
05:21:11.110 --> 05:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
the one that was on remote
 
05:21:14.708 --> 05:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
we saw drastic shrinkage emotional
 
05:21:14.718 --> 05:21:15.830 align:start position:0%
we saw drastic shrinkage emotional
mental

05:21:15.830 --> 05:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
mental
 
05:21:18.830 --> 05:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
social issues yes
 
05:21:22.150 --> 05:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
so which of those options is the best
 
05:21:22.160 --> 05:21:23.190 align:start position:0%
so which of those options is the best
option

05:21:23.190 --> 05:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
option
 
05:21:25.270 --> 05:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know representative and it's not an
 
05:21:27.030 --> 05:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
easy decision here
 
05:21:29.750 --> 05:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
remote learning constant remote learning
 
05:21:31.750 --> 05:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
is not a good thing we understand that
 
05:21:34.310 --> 05:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's had negative impacts for a lot of
 
05:21:36.310 --> 05:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
kids but right now we're not talking
 
05:21:38.390 --> 05:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
about having the school closed for
 
05:21:40.708 --> 05:21:40.718 align:start position:0%
months like it was in the early days of
 
05:21:43.350 --> 05:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
the of the pandemic right now we're
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
talking about a school that is so poorly
 
05:21:48.390 --> 05:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
staffed that they are not safe
 
05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
to have they don't have enough adults to
 
05:21:52.868 --> 05:21:52.878 align:start position:0%
watch over the children that do come in
 
05:21:54.788 --> 05:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
and they're forced to stay open when
 
05:21:56.948 --> 05:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
they could close for a day or two go
 
05:21:59.430 --> 05:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
remote and then come back as things
 
05:22:01.750 --> 05:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
get better right now they're not allowed
 
05:22:04.548 --> 05:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
to do that i don't think we're asking
 
05:22:06.470 --> 05:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
communities to keep their schools closed
 
05:22:06.480 --> 05:22:07.590 align:start position:0%
communities to keep their schools closed
forever

05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
forever
 
05:22:10.788 --> 05:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
but certainly i would want my child with
 
05:22:13.430 --> 05:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
their teacher on their computer learning
 
05:22:15.510 --> 05:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
a new skill than sitting with four other
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
children in an empty classroom where i
 
05:22:19.510 --> 05:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
can't learn anything new because my
 
05:22:21.350 --> 05:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
classmates aren't there so i'm there
 
05:22:23.910 --> 05:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
doing other things
 
05:22:25.270 --> 05:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
and it's a wasted
 
05:22:26.948 --> 05:22:26.958 align:start position:0%
week for new learning
 
05:22:29.670 --> 05:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
or jammed into an auditorium with 80 or
 
05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
another 100 or 100 kids
 
05:22:33.510 --> 05:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
working on my computer because there's
 
05:22:35.750 --> 05:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
not enough teachers to teach me there
 
05:22:38.708 --> 05:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
i just i think we have to be as the
 
05:22:40.788 --> 05:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
commissioners often said we have to be
 
05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
nimble and allow schools to make the
 
05:22:45.670 --> 05:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
best decisions for their kids at the
 
05:22:47.350 --> 05:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
time so they could close for a day or
 
05:22:49.350 --> 05:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
two and then come back when things ease
 
05:22:49.360 --> 05:22:50.070 align:start position:0%
two and then come back when things ease
up

05:22:50.070 --> 05:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:22:52.150 --> 05:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
but right now they can't do that and so
 
05:22:53.670 --> 05:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
every time they close down because it's
 
05:22:55.750 --> 05:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
not safe they have to add those days in
 
05:22:58.470 --> 05:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
june and when when june is over
 
05:22:59.830 --> 05:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's the end of the school year so if
 
05:23:01.110 --> 05:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough days what's going
 
05:23:02.390 --> 05:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
05:23:04.150 --> 05:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
and for the teachers who are there and
 
05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
are doing remote even though this this
 
05:23:08.548 --> 05:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
the school decides to go remote and
 
05:23:10.390 --> 05:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
teaching remote they are using up their
 
05:23:12.390 --> 05:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
teaching days so if the days still have
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
to be made up at the end of the year
 
05:23:15.510 --> 05:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to be over contract and
 
05:23:17.030 --> 05:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to be expensive for
 
05:23:19.030 --> 05:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
districts because they have to get
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
already used up 385 days or whatever
 
05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
so we need to give them the flexibility
 
05:23:25.670 --> 05:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
to do what's best for the kids under
 
05:23:27.590 --> 05:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
their care
 
05:23:29.030 --> 05:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
and they don't have it right now thank
 
05:23:30.788 --> 05:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
you representative tanner
 
05:23:33.190 --> 05:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:23:37.270 --> 05:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:40.150 --> 05:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
do you think that it that not allowing
 
05:23:40.160 --> 05:23:41.190 align:start position:0%
do you think that it that not allowing
remote

05:23:41.190 --> 05:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
remote
 
05:23:41.200 --> 05:23:42.548 align:start position:0%
remote
learning

05:23:42.548 --> 05:23:42.558 align:start position:0%
learning
 
05:23:44.868 --> 05:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh when there are clusters within the
 
05:23:46.948 --> 05:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
school or when the school has a very
 
05:23:46.958 --> 05:23:47.990 align:start position:0%
school or when the school has a very
high

05:23:47.990 --> 05:23:48.000 align:start position:0%

05:23:48.000 --> 05:23:49.670 align:start position:0%

05:23:50.948 --> 05:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:23:50.958 --> 05:23:52.310 align:start position:0%
time
takes

05:23:52.310 --> 05:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
takes
 
05:23:54.390 --> 05:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
out the possibility
 
05:23:56.788 --> 05:23:56.798 align:start position:0%
of deep cleaning that the schools i know
 
05:23:58.150 --> 05:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
have done
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
uh in the past when they've had these
 
05:24:02.628 --> 05:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
clusters and then they take a couple
 
05:24:02.638 --> 05:24:03.430 align:start position:0%
clusters and then they take a couple
days

05:24:03.430 --> 05:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
days
 
05:24:05.750 --> 05:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
to go remote uh do you think it really
 
05:24:07.270 --> 05:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
curbs that
 
05:24:08.788 --> 05:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
you know i had i hadn't thought of that
 
05:24:10.788 --> 05:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
representative but that's a very valid
 
05:24:10.798 --> 05:24:11.830 align:start position:0%
representative but that's a very valid
point

05:24:11.830 --> 05:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:24:14.310 --> 05:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:15.750 --> 05:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
05:24:17.830 --> 05:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:24:20.230 --> 05:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
my question representative porter
 
05:24:20.240 --> 05:24:21.350 align:start position:0%
my question representative porter
um

05:24:21.350 --> 05:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:23.590 --> 05:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about schools making
 
05:24:25.990 --> 05:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
individual decisions we're talking about
 
05:24:29.110 --> 05:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
the school board in a community
 
05:24:32.230 --> 05:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
adopting some sort of uh
 
05:24:35.270 --> 05:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
metric or policy or whatever correct
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:40.708 --> 05:24:40.718 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:24:43.510 --> 05:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative litchfield
 
05:24:45.190 --> 05:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
do you think maybe it would be good if
 
05:24:48.548 --> 05:24:48.558 align:start position:0%
we were to address this at the source
 
05:24:51.590 --> 05:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
which is why are these schools being
 
05:24:54.470 --> 05:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
closed due to large clusters a lot of it
 
05:24:56.948 --> 05:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
is due to possibly maybe children being
 
05:25:00.230 --> 05:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
quarantined up to 10 days
 
05:25:02.070 --> 05:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
at one point because they were possibly
 
05:25:05.110 --> 05:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
a close contact or possibly maybe we
 
05:25:06.868 --> 05:25:06.878 align:start position:0%
don't have enough testing sites
 
05:25:09.190 --> 05:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
available and if a child coughs or
 
05:25:10.948 --> 05:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
sneezes they're not allowed back in the
 
05:25:12.548 --> 05:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
classroom it could take up to two or
 
05:25:13.670 --> 05:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
three days
 
05:25:16.310 --> 05:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
to find a test
 
05:25:17.910 --> 05:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know representative i do know
 
05:25:19.830 --> 05:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
that in hillsboro the town that i live
 
05:25:24.230 --> 05:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:26.310 --> 05:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
currently only 40
 
05:25:29.750 --> 05:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
of our population is fully vaccinated
 
05:25:32.470 --> 05:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
and the daily count of new cases
 
05:25:34.708 --> 05:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
the daily count of cases is approaching
 
05:25:39.270 --> 05:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
65 and 70. we're a small community
 
05:25:41.510 --> 05:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
is that the fault of
 
05:25:43.190 --> 05:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
having to quarantine
 
05:25:44.948 --> 05:25:44.958 align:start position:0%
i don't know who to put place the blame
 
05:25:47.830 --> 05:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
on but the reality is that my school has
 
05:25:50.070 --> 05:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
to stay open
 
05:25:51.830 --> 05:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
when they don't have enough staff and
 
05:25:53.270 --> 05:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
when they're not there aren't enough
 
05:25:54.788 --> 05:25:54.798 align:start position:0%
kids there to really do a full
 
05:25:57.510 --> 05:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
educational program
 
05:25:59.110 --> 05:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
are there another other questions for
 
05:26:01.350 --> 05:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
the representative representative tanner
 
05:26:03.510 --> 05:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh one more question and that
 
05:26:05.910 --> 05:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
is do you feel that if
 
05:26:07.670 --> 05:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
schools had
 
05:26:10.948 --> 05:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
the ability to have a school nurse
 
05:26:12.628 --> 05:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
and testing
 
05:26:15.270 --> 05:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
kits on a regular basis
 
05:26:17.270 --> 05:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
that there wouldn't be the sniffles and
 
05:26:18.948 --> 05:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
the people sent home
 
05:26:22.150 --> 05:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh for quarantining and probably
 
05:26:25.750 --> 05:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
reduce some of this uh problem as well
 
05:26:28.470 --> 05:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's all very possible representative
 
05:26:30.310 --> 05:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
all i know is that right now their hands
 
05:26:32.708 --> 05:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
are tied and they are forced to remain
 
05:26:37.910 --> 05:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:40.070 --> 05:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:26:42.310 --> 05:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:26:42.320 --> 05:26:43.110 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

everybody on the committee i presume
 
05:27:11.190 --> 05:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
knows that i think it was just last week
 
05:27:13.030 --> 05:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
the state board of education
 
05:27:15.430 --> 05:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
adopted revisions to department of state
 
05:27:16.628 --> 05:27:16.638 align:start position:0%
board rule
 
05:27:16.638 --> 05:27:19.510 align:start position:0%
board rule

05:27:19.510 --> 05:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
306.22
 
05:27:22.150 --> 05:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know i nhsba we had very good
 
05:27:23.910 --> 05:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
conversations with the department when
 
05:27:25.350 --> 05:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
they were in the state board when they
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
were considering that i had a handful of
 
05:27:30.150 --> 05:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
conversations with uh commissioner blue
 
05:27:32.390 --> 05:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
i had a handful of conversations with
 
05:27:34.708 --> 05:27:34.718 align:start position:0%
mr klein we provided some suggested
 
05:27:34.718 --> 05:27:36.948 align:start position:0%
mr klein we provided some suggested
language

05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:27:39.510 --> 05:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
they understood nhsba's perspective in
 
05:27:42.708 --> 05:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
allowing um multiple flexibility and
 
05:27:44.948 --> 05:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
multiple options for local local school
 
05:27:47.590 --> 05:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
boards and i certainly understand um the
 
05:27:50.230 --> 05:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
position of the state board
 
05:27:52.548 --> 05:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
the the learning loss with schools being
 
05:27:54.070 --> 05:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
close has been significant nobody
 
05:27:57.190 --> 05:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
disputes that um nobody disputes that
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
children are best educated when they're
 
05:28:00.868 --> 05:28:00.878 align:start position:0%
in a school building in front of a
 
05:28:03.510 --> 05:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
certified trained experienced teacher
 
05:28:05.350 --> 05:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
nobody would dispute that
 
05:28:07.110 --> 05:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
the question though is whether or not we
 
05:28:09.190 --> 05:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
want to provide certain flexibilities to
 
05:28:12.390 --> 05:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
our local school districts and we heard
 
05:28:14.310 --> 05:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
the award was used flexibility was used
 
05:28:15.590 --> 05:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about learn
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
everywhere earlier this morning we were
 
05:28:19.910 --> 05:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
talking about flexibility with the
 
05:28:21.590 --> 05:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
depart leaving and that having the
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
department having flexibility um with
 
05:28:25.830 --> 05:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
respect to the code of conduct with the
 
05:28:28.150 --> 05:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
bill that was previously before us
 
05:28:32.230 --> 05:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
um the concerns nhsba has um with uh the
 
05:28:33.990 --> 05:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
the current version of the department of
 
05:28:36.310 --> 05:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
education rule that was just adopted is
 
05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
that it only leaves two options open for
 
05:28:42.150 --> 05:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
a school district um to close
 
05:28:45.350 --> 05:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
a a school one is inclement weather and
 
05:28:47.590 --> 05:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
the other is um i'm sorry to offer
 
05:28:50.070 --> 05:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
distance education one was inclement
 
05:28:51.990 --> 05:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
weather the other was upon parental
 
05:28:53.350 --> 05:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
requests so
 
05:28:55.270 --> 05:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know so a kid can take a vlax class
 
05:28:57.430 --> 05:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
or find an online course to take latin
 
05:28:59.990 --> 05:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
or mandarin or whatever it might be
 
05:29:01.030 --> 05:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:29:03.110 --> 05:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
dozens of other reasons why a school
 
05:29:05.910 --> 05:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
facility may need to be closed for a
 
05:29:07.990 --> 05:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
certain number of days there may be a
 
05:29:10.628 --> 05:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
chemical spill um you know near near the
 
05:29:14.628 --> 05:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
facility uh when was it uh 2007 2008 we
 
05:29:16.948 --> 05:29:16.958 align:start position:0%
had the ice storm that hit the southwest
 
05:29:19.270 --> 05:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
region of the state and trees were down
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
and if there was even power to do remote
 
05:29:24.548 --> 05:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
if you will um you know my understanding
 
05:29:27.030 --> 05:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
was there was a fugitive on the run near
 
05:29:28.868 --> 05:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
kearsarge high school
 
05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
three or four years ago when the guy was
 
05:29:32.070 --> 05:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
hiding out in the woods so they had to
 
05:29:34.150 --> 05:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
close the school for three or four days
 
05:29:37.190 --> 05:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
till they captured this this individual
 
05:29:41.350 --> 05:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
so um you know we support um you know
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
everybody knows nhsba supports local
 
05:29:46.070 --> 05:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
control over local educational matters
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the local school board should be
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
able to determine what's best for that
 
05:29:51.430 --> 05:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
specific community representative porter
 
05:29:53.030 --> 05:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
talked about a lot of the logistical
 
05:29:54.628 --> 05:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
issues that our school districts are
 
05:29:56.310 --> 05:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
facing right now
 
05:29:57.910 --> 05:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
teachers are getting sick we don't have
 
05:29:59.590 --> 05:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
substitutes we have
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
you know the lack of substitutes is so
 
05:30:02.160 --> 05:30:03.190 align:start position:0%
you know the lack of substitutes is so
severe

05:30:03.190 --> 05:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
severe
 
05:30:05.110 --> 05:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
we've had to lower some of the standards
 
05:30:05.120 --> 05:30:05.990 align:start position:0%
we've had to lower some of the standards
for

05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:30:07.910 --> 05:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
teachers aids and substitute teachers in
 
05:30:09.190 --> 05:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
our school you know that you just want
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
somebody who is you know maybe at least
 
05:30:12.948 --> 05:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
you know at least old enough to buy
 
05:30:12.958 --> 05:30:15.110 align:start position:0%
you know at least old enough to buy
alcohol

05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
05:30:17.990 --> 05:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
and now i'm not joking we're having 19
 
05:30:19.990 --> 05:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
20 year old kids that are
 
05:30:21.830 --> 05:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
being teachers aids and being
 
05:30:23.270 --> 05:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals and being student
 
05:30:24.868 --> 05:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
teachers because we need we need the
 
05:30:26.948 --> 05:30:26.958 align:start position:0%
bodies in there um
 
05:30:29.590 --> 05:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
so uh there are the legit logistical
 
05:30:32.230 --> 05:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
challenges um you know with what we're
 
05:30:34.230 --> 05:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
facing still in the midst of of the
 
05:30:36.548 --> 05:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
pandemic we think there are broader
 
05:30:38.390 --> 05:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
operational reasons why school boards
 
05:30:41.030 --> 05:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
should retain this level of flexibility
 
05:30:41.040 --> 05:30:41.990 align:start position:0%
should retain this level of flexibility
um

05:30:41.990 --> 05:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:43.590 --> 05:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
i had one other point i was i was going
 
05:30:45.030 --> 05:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
to make as well too
 
05:30:46.788 --> 05:30:46.798 align:start position:0%
and last um
 
05:30:49.750 --> 05:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:52.070 --> 05:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
by and by limiting
 
05:30:55.110 --> 05:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
the flexibility options you know we hope
 
05:30:55.120 --> 05:30:55.830 align:start position:0%
the flexibility options you know we hope
that

05:30:55.830 --> 05:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:30:58.070 --> 05:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
the pandemic gets better
 
05:30:58.080 --> 05:30:59.590 align:start position:0%
the pandemic gets better
but

05:30:59.590 --> 05:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:31:01.830 --> 05:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
is it going to be better in june are we
 
05:31:04.548 --> 05:31:04.558 align:start position:0%
able to you know stay fully open
 
05:31:06.390 --> 05:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
you know the the eight o'clock till
 
05:31:09.110 --> 05:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
three o'clock come june nobody seems to
 
05:31:10.548 --> 05:31:10.558 align:start position:0%
know you know every time we think we're
 
05:31:12.548 --> 05:31:12.558 align:start position:0%
sort of out of the woods with this
 
05:31:14.948 --> 05:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
whether it's the delta or the omicron or
 
05:31:17.190 --> 05:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
who knows what's going to be next um
 
05:31:19.750 --> 05:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
seems to be popping up so anyway i just
 
05:31:21.750 --> 05:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know certainly say we
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
understand the department's um point of
 
05:31:24.948 --> 05:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
view in the state board's point of view
 
05:31:26.628 --> 05:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
we had good conversations with chairman
 
05:31:28.470 --> 05:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
klein and the commissioner
 
05:31:30.548 --> 05:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
nhsba just happens to disagree with the
 
05:31:32.470 --> 05:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
final rule um
 
05:31:33.990 --> 05:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
but you know uh
 
05:31:35.990 --> 05:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
we think more flexibility is is better
 
05:31:37.510 --> 05:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
for local school boards to make these
 
05:31:39.670 --> 05:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
local determinations so with that i'm
 
05:31:42.070 --> 05:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions uh i have
 
05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
a question for you first here uh barrett
 
05:31:48.708 --> 05:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the area of law where
 
05:31:51.990 --> 05:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're shuffling this verbiage into
 
05:31:54.628 --> 05:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
it's comes underneath school performance
 
05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:03.030 --> 05:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
which seems to me that
 
05:32:05.270 --> 05:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
the language which is already in there
 
05:32:06.948 --> 05:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
speaks to the
 
05:32:08.948 --> 05:32:08.958 align:start position:0%
the state can't shut down a school or
 
05:32:10.230 --> 05:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
just take over the management of a
 
05:32:13.430 --> 05:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
school that's in that's in relation to
 
05:32:13.440 --> 05:32:14.390 align:start position:0%
school that's in that's in relation to
uh

05:32:14.390 --> 05:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:32:16.390 --> 05:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
pro and most likely i'm
 
05:32:18.548 --> 05:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
looking into this in terms of possible
 
05:32:21.190 --> 05:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
intent that they're not doing the
 
05:32:22.948 --> 05:32:22.958 align:start position:0%
not achieving what they should be in
 
05:32:24.628 --> 05:32:24.638 align:start position:0%
terms of their accountability and their
 
05:32:24.638 --> 05:32:26.390 align:start position:0%
terms of their accountability and their
performance

05:32:26.390 --> 05:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
performance
 
05:32:28.948 --> 05:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
is there not a better place to put this
 
05:32:31.590 --> 05:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
language like in 21n or someplace under
 
05:32:34.230 --> 05:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities of the local or of
 
05:32:36.230 --> 05:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
the state board or the department of
 
05:32:36.240 --> 05:32:37.350 align:start position:0%
the state board or the department of
education

05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh putting it underneath performance
 
05:32:41.510 --> 05:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
economy ra accountability raises
 
05:32:44.070 --> 05:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
questions in my mind if it's properly
 
05:32:45.590 --> 05:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
placed yeah thank you very much for the
 
05:32:46.868 --> 05:32:46.878 align:start position:0%
question representative i'll be honest
 
05:32:48.230 --> 05:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
with you i didn't even notice the
 
05:32:49.590 --> 05:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
placement of the statute i was looking
 
05:32:52.150 --> 05:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
at just at the language of of the bill
 
05:32:55.270 --> 05:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah i i i would be inclined to agree
 
05:32:57.270 --> 05:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
that um the language would probably be
 
05:33:00.628 --> 05:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
better placed in 21n perhaps 186 which
 
05:33:01.990 --> 05:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
is a
 
05:33:03.510 --> 05:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
lengthy list of of duties and
 
05:33:05.030 --> 05:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the state board of
 
05:33:07.270 --> 05:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
education the language could also be
 
05:33:10.390 --> 05:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
modified um and rather than you know
 
05:33:12.868 --> 05:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
limiting depart rather than having a law
 
05:33:14.948 --> 05:33:14.958 align:start position:0%
that limits
 
05:33:17.190 --> 05:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
authority of the department of education
 
05:33:19.030 --> 05:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
nhsba would certainly support a bill
 
05:33:20.788 --> 05:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
that would enhance the authority of
 
05:33:22.628 --> 05:33:22.638 align:start position:0%
local school districts local school
 
05:33:24.548 --> 05:33:24.558 align:start position:0%
boards so you could put an amendment in
 
05:33:26.470 --> 05:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps 189
 
05:33:27.990 --> 05:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
but yeah i'll be honest with you i
 
05:33:29.670 --> 05:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
didn't even look at the placement of of
 
05:33:31.750 --> 05:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
of where this bill would go so
 
05:33:33.190 --> 05:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
i mean we certainly agree with the
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
language of the bill where where you
 
05:33:36.548 --> 05:33:36.558 align:start position:0%
want to put it is
 
05:33:39.350 --> 05:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
is is not overly relevant to nhsba but i
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
agree mayor perhaps a different place
 
05:33:42.868 --> 05:33:42.878 align:start position:0%
would be better
 
05:33:45.670 --> 05:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh i i always try to
 
05:33:47.590 --> 05:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
word something the positive rather than
 
05:33:48.868 --> 05:33:48.878 align:start position:0%
in the negative
 
05:33:51.590 --> 05:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
this is coming out you can't do this but
 
05:33:53.590 --> 05:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
let's put it somewhere else where you
 
05:33:57.430 --> 05:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
can do this sure enabling or authorizing
 
05:33:59.190 --> 05:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
exactly yes
 
05:34:01.270 --> 05:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative lakers says we're here
 
05:34:03.990 --> 05:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes represent like us
 
05:34:06.948 --> 05:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
thank you i realized that a lot of this
 
05:34:09.910 --> 05:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill seems to be in response to what the
 
05:34:12.390 --> 05:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
department of education recently did and
 
05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about short-term closures
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
etc but from reading the language it
 
05:34:19.670 --> 05:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
seems to be more encompassing than that
 
05:34:22.310 --> 05:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
and what about when a school district
 
05:34:24.470 --> 05:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
just decides regardless of what the
 
05:34:26.470 --> 05:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
level of covet is
 
05:34:29.190 --> 05:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
in the community to not be open for an
 
05:34:31.350 --> 05:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
entire year
 
05:34:32.470 --> 05:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:34:34.548 --> 05:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
05:34:35.590 --> 05:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:34:35.600 --> 05:34:36.548 align:start position:0%
you know
last

05:34:36.548 --> 05:34:36.558 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:34:38.708 --> 05:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
fall and i should not last for i guess
 
05:34:40.150 --> 05:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
it was fall of
 
05:34:40.160 --> 05:34:41.670 align:start position:0%
it was fall of
2020

05:34:41.670 --> 05:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
2020
 
05:34:41.680 --> 05:34:42.948 align:start position:0%
2020
um

05:34:42.948 --> 05:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:45.030 --> 05:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
local school districts were still given
 
05:34:46.788 --> 05:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
that flexibility we had some school
 
05:34:48.070 --> 05:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
districts that were still going full
 
05:34:50.070 --> 05:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
remote we had some school districts that
 
05:34:50.080 --> 05:34:51.030 align:start position:0%
remote we had some school districts that
were

05:34:51.030 --> 05:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
doing full in person and we had some
 
05:34:54.948 --> 05:34:54.958 align:start position:0%
school districts that were doing hybrid
 
05:34:56.310 --> 05:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
coupled you know kids were in a couple
 
05:34:58.868 --> 05:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
days split schedules that's that sort of
 
05:34:58.878 --> 05:34:59.750 align:start position:0%
days split schedules that's that sort of
stuff

05:34:59.750 --> 05:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
05:35:02.548 --> 05:35:02.558 align:start position:0%
um you know that seemed to be um you
 
05:35:03.750 --> 05:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
know i think
 
05:35:06.788 --> 05:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
the most ideal method and i don't know
 
05:35:09.270 --> 05:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
of any school right now that is really
 
05:35:09.280 --> 05:35:10.470 align:start position:0%
of any school right now that is really
interested

05:35:10.470 --> 05:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
interested
 
05:35:13.110 --> 05:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
or has any intentions of closing
 
05:35:13.120 --> 05:35:14.230 align:start position:0%
or has any intentions of closing
for

05:35:14.230 --> 05:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:35:17.030 --> 05:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
a month six months a semester a year
 
05:35:19.030 --> 05:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to do that and i haven't
 
05:35:20.230 --> 05:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
heard from any school boards or
 
05:35:22.470 --> 05:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
superintendents that they plan on doing
 
05:35:24.390 --> 05:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
that my understanding and speaking with
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
the superintendents um that have called
 
05:35:29.190 --> 05:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
on hsba asking for guidance about the
 
05:35:31.110 --> 05:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
ability to close
 
05:35:34.230 --> 05:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
prior to the recent rule being adopted
 
05:35:36.788 --> 05:35:36.798 align:start position:0%
were you know they needed to do it
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
out of sheer necessity because you know
 
05:35:41.110 --> 05:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
either they didn't have the staff they
 
05:35:43.910 --> 05:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have the the substitute teachers
 
05:35:46.150 --> 05:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
um they didn't have bus drive bus
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
drivers have gotten covert as well too
 
05:35:49.270 --> 05:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
we know there's a bus driver shortage
 
05:35:51.270 --> 05:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
across the state as well too
 
05:35:53.990 --> 05:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
so you know one of the proposals or i
 
05:35:55.190 --> 05:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
mean i don't want to call it a firm
 
05:35:57.990 --> 05:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
proposal one of the conversations that
 
05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
nhsba had with um commissioner edelblut
 
05:36:02.628 --> 05:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
and mr klein
 
05:36:02.638 --> 05:36:03.430 align:start position:0%
and mr klein
was

05:36:03.430 --> 05:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:36:05.350 --> 05:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
you know some flexibility where you
 
05:36:07.510 --> 05:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
could go remote up to
 
05:36:10.070 --> 05:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
10 days per se in a school year and
 
05:36:11.830 --> 05:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
beyond that you would perhaps have to
 
05:36:13.510 --> 05:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
file some sort of emergency petition
 
05:36:15.030 --> 05:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner who would have
 
05:36:17.590 --> 05:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
some sort of rubric to check the boxes
 
05:36:19.350 --> 05:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
if these boxes are checked then yes you
 
05:36:21.270 --> 05:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
can continue remote if not then you have
 
05:36:23.270 --> 05:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
to come back in person that was at least
 
05:36:25.030 --> 05:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
part of the conversation that that we
 
05:36:28.150 --> 05:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
had anyway so there are a myriad of ways
 
05:36:29.830 --> 05:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
that i think you could possibly go with
 
05:36:29.840 --> 05:36:30.948 align:start position:0%
that i think you could possibly go with
us

05:36:30.948 --> 05:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
us
 
05:36:33.030 --> 05:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you thank you
 
05:36:34.628 --> 05:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
05:36:36.230 --> 05:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
05:36:38.070 --> 05:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much everyone uh drew
 
05:36:38.080 --> 05:36:39.190 align:start position:0%
thank you very much everyone uh drew
klein

05:36:39.190 --> 05:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
klein
 
05:36:46.470 --> 05:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:48.150 --> 05:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:36:50.548 --> 05:36:50.558 align:start position:0%
hello again everyone mr chairman thank
 
05:36:52.470 --> 05:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
you um
 
05:36:54.470 --> 05:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
this is not a comment on the previous
 
05:36:57.110 --> 05:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
bill but i have no um desire to wear a
 
05:37:00.628 --> 05:37:00.638 align:start position:0%
badge just so everybody knows um
 
05:37:02.470 --> 05:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to give uh i'll try to
 
05:37:04.070 --> 05:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
be quick here i got some data i'd like
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
to go through but first i want to
 
05:37:07.510 --> 05:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the rule that the
 
05:37:09.270 --> 05:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
board of education passed actually does
 
05:37:11.430 --> 05:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
and for clarity sake that rule
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
is not adopted yet we have to go to jail
 
05:37:15.030 --> 05:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
car and then has to come back to the
 
05:37:16.708 --> 05:37:16.718 align:start position:0%
board so it's not actually in effect yet
 
05:37:18.310 --> 05:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to take probably till march
 
05:37:20.548 --> 05:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
before it actually gets goes into effect
 
05:37:22.390 --> 05:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
so right now we're that we're still
 
05:37:24.628 --> 05:37:24.638 align:start position:0%
under the current rule which does allow
 
05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
districts to go uh remote if they want
 
05:37:27.360 --> 05:37:28.708 align:start position:0%
districts to go uh remote if they want
um

05:37:28.708 --> 05:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:30.470 --> 05:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
the i want to talk about why we did the
 
05:37:31.990 --> 05:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
rule the way we did and we had a lot of
 
05:37:33.270 --> 05:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
discussions a lot of back and forth it
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't really nilly we took months to to
 
05:37:37.190 --> 05:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
work on this and
 
05:37:39.270 --> 05:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
what we crafted was an option a rule
 
05:37:41.110 --> 05:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
that gave parents
 
05:37:45.190 --> 05:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
some say not total say but some buy-in
 
05:37:45.200 --> 05:37:46.230 align:start position:0%
some say not total say but some buy-in
um

05:37:46.230 --> 05:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:48.948 --> 05:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
in real time when a district wanted to
 
05:37:50.948 --> 05:37:50.958 align:start position:0%
go remote and just to clarify what the
 
05:37:52.070 --> 05:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
rule says
 
05:37:54.628 --> 05:37:54.638 align:start position:0%
there is zero prohibition
 
05:37:56.788 --> 05:37:56.798 align:start position:0%
on closing the school
 
05:37:56.798 --> 05:37:58.070 align:start position:0%
on closing the school
zero

05:37:58.070 --> 05:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
zero
 
05:37:59.990 --> 05:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
if for health and safety reasons for
 
05:38:02.390 --> 05:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
covet for any whatever reason a district
 
05:38:03.750 --> 05:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
wants to close the school our rule does
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
not prohibit closures at all
 
05:38:09.190 --> 05:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
so schools can close if their cases rise
 
05:38:10.788 --> 05:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
and community spread if they have staff
 
05:38:12.548 --> 05:38:12.558 align:start position:0%
shortages nothing prevents schools
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
closures i want to make that very clear
 
05:38:16.070 --> 05:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
we were we very specific about that
 
05:38:17.030 --> 05:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
because we
 
05:38:18.628 --> 05:38:18.638 align:start position:0%
were concerned about public health and
 
05:38:20.470 --> 05:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
safety we didn't want to prohibit a
 
05:38:22.788 --> 05:38:22.798 align:start position:0%
school from closing what the rule says
 
05:38:26.548 --> 05:38:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:27.990 --> 05:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
the instruction
 
05:38:31.430 --> 05:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
can be remote only if you are closed for
 
05:38:32.788 --> 05:38:32.798 align:start position:0%
inclement weather
 
05:38:34.310 --> 05:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
so that would include a blizzard ice
 
05:38:37.030 --> 05:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
storm snowstorm etc um and the reason we
 
05:38:38.470 --> 05:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
included that was we wanted to be
 
05:38:40.150 --> 05:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
consistent with the blizzard bag rule
 
05:38:42.628 --> 05:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
that predated the pandemic we just
 
05:38:44.150 --> 05:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
updated the blizzard bag rule for the
 
05:38:45.990 --> 05:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
current technology to allow them to use
 
05:38:48.310 --> 05:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
remote instruction if they chose
 
05:38:50.470 --> 05:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
instead of sending actual paper homework
 
05:38:53.270 --> 05:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
packets so that was for continuity there
 
05:38:53.280 --> 05:38:54.548 align:start position:0%
packets so that was for continuity there
um

05:38:54.548 --> 05:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:56.390 --> 05:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
the only other way you can go remote
 
05:38:57.990 --> 05:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
under the rule
 
05:39:02.070 --> 05:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
and i just want to talk about that for a
 
05:39:05.280 --> 05:39:06.310 align:start position:0%
and i just want to talk about that for a
moment

05:39:06.310 --> 05:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
moment
 
05:39:06.320 --> 05:39:07.190 align:start position:0%
moment
um

05:39:07.190 --> 05:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:09.670 --> 05:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
we were very deliberate about that
 
05:39:12.868 --> 05:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
and and the reason was the data that
 
05:39:15.750 --> 05:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
we've uh found you don't have to go by
 
05:39:18.548 --> 05:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
anecdote at this point we have massive
 
05:39:20.310 --> 05:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
amounts of data globally and in the
 
05:39:21.830 --> 05:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
united states and in new hampshire to
 
05:39:23.270 --> 05:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
show the
 
05:39:25.510 --> 05:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
horrible catastrophic
 
05:39:28.390 --> 05:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
consequences of forced remote
 
05:39:30.310 --> 05:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
instruction and i'm not being flippant
 
05:39:32.230 --> 05:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
when i say forced i'm choosing that word
 
05:39:35.110 --> 05:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
carefully because what i mean by that is
 
05:39:36.470 --> 05:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
remote instruction
 
05:39:36.480 --> 05:39:38.390 align:start position:0%
remote instruction
um

05:39:38.390 --> 05:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:40.150 --> 05:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't work well for every single
 
05:39:41.750 --> 05:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
family there are some families who can
 
05:39:43.990 --> 05:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
adapt to it really well and those kids
 
05:39:46.548 --> 05:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
actually thrived in remote but there's a
 
05:39:48.868 --> 05:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
large subset of families for her remote
 
05:39:50.788 --> 05:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
instruction does not work
 
05:39:53.190 --> 05:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
those children tend to be the more
 
05:39:55.510 --> 05:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerable more disadvantaged
 
05:39:58.470 --> 05:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
and that's what the data show and so
 
05:40:00.628 --> 05:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
when they don't have an option
 
05:40:02.548 --> 05:40:02.558 align:start position:0%
when they are told um
 
05:40:04.470 --> 05:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
school is going to be conducted in your
 
05:40:07.030 --> 05:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
home through a computer and some adult
 
05:40:08.150 --> 05:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
in your home is going to have to
 
05:40:10.948 --> 05:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
basically function as a paraprofessional
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
they're just not equipped to handle that
 
05:40:14.070 --> 05:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of families that
 
05:40:15.990 --> 05:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
struggled with that and that's borne out
 
05:40:18.070 --> 05:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the data and what we wanted to do was
 
05:40:20.230 --> 05:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
essentially protect those families so we
 
05:40:22.150 --> 05:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
gave parents an option if remote
 
05:40:23.750 --> 05:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
instruction is what you want go to your
 
05:40:25.350 --> 05:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
school and request it
 
05:40:27.350 --> 05:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
we do not require the school to offer it
 
05:40:28.948 --> 05:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure that we weren't
 
05:40:31.190 --> 05:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
putting that mandate on schools because
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
that we felt like would be
 
05:40:34.390 --> 05:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
a bit of an imposition there and
 
05:40:35.430 --> 05:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
technologically we didn't want to
 
05:40:37.670 --> 05:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
require it
 
05:40:37.680 --> 05:40:39.590 align:start position:0%
require it
but

05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:40:41.030 --> 05:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to force remote
 
05:40:42.470 --> 05:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
instruction within districts to force
 
05:40:43.990 --> 05:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
remote instruction on families for whom
 
05:40:45.750 --> 05:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
it was a really bad fit and for whom it
 
05:40:47.910 --> 05:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
had negative consequences so that's why
 
05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
we structured the rule the way we did
 
05:40:51.190 --> 05:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'm going to just read really quickly
 
05:40:52.390 --> 05:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
some of the data i'll try to get through
 
05:40:53.830 --> 05:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
it quick but i think it's really
 
05:40:55.670 --> 05:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
important when we wrote the rule that's
 
05:40:57.670 --> 05:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
currently in place that allows districts
 
05:41:00.470 --> 05:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
to go remote
 
05:41:03.110 --> 05:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
we drafted that rule in the fall
 
05:41:04.708 --> 05:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
of 2020
 
05:41:07.350 --> 05:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
before we had this data so we were
 
05:41:08.628 --> 05:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
starting to get tricklings of it but we
 
05:41:12.310 --> 05:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
didn't really know the impact of
 
05:41:14.310 --> 05:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
large-scale remote instruction and i'm
 
05:41:15.430 --> 05:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
going to go through some of the numbers
 
05:41:17.590 --> 05:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
that we've we now have
 
05:41:19.750 --> 05:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
um in the netherlands they were one of
 
05:41:21.510 --> 05:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
the first to close down
 
05:41:24.470 --> 05:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
they did a short short closure and they
 
05:41:26.390 --> 05:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
they studied the fact learning loss was
 
05:41:28.310 --> 05:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
shown to equal roughly one-fifth of a
 
05:41:29.350 --> 05:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
school year
 
05:41:31.270 --> 05:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
with students from less educated homes
 
05:41:33.830 --> 05:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
demonstrating losses up to 60 larger so
 
05:41:35.510 --> 05:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
right away you're starting to see the
 
05:41:38.470 --> 05:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
disparate impact of remote learning by
 
05:41:40.948 --> 05:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
the way in the netherlands they had a
 
05:41:43.030 --> 05:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
system where schools could close and go
 
05:41:43.040 --> 05:41:44.150 align:start position:0%
system where schools could close and go
remote

05:41:44.150 --> 05:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
remote
 
05:41:44.160 --> 05:41:45.110 align:start position:0%
remote
but

05:41:45.110 --> 05:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:41:47.590 --> 05:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
if you were a family
 
05:41:49.510 --> 05:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
that that didn't work for
 
05:41:51.670 --> 05:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
they had from the very beginning they
 
05:41:54.470 --> 05:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
let you go in person so they did even
 
05:41:55.670 --> 05:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
though they closed and went remote they
 
05:41:57.990 --> 05:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
had facilities for low-income families
 
05:41:59.670 --> 05:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
less educated families that needed that
 
05:42:01.270 --> 05:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
in-person instruction they accommodated
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
them and gave them in person
 
05:42:05.590 --> 05:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
and they still had those large learning
 
05:42:05.600 --> 05:42:06.708 align:start position:0%
and they still had those large learning
losses

05:42:06.708 --> 05:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
losses
 
05:42:08.470 --> 05:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
a mckinsey study from last year found
 
05:42:10.230 --> 05:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
that students nationwide in the u.s
 
05:42:12.390 --> 05:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
wound up four months behind in reading
 
05:42:14.548 --> 05:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
and five months behind in math by the
 
05:42:16.788 --> 05:42:16.798 align:start position:0%

declined compared to prior years and
 
05:42:28.470 --> 05:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
these declines were larger in districts
 
05:42:30.548 --> 05:42:30.558 align:start position:0%
with less in-person instruction end
 
05:42:30.558 --> 05:42:31.750 align:start position:0%
with less in-person instruction end

05:42:31.750 --> 05:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
quote
 
05:42:34.070 --> 05:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
pass rates fell an average of 6.3
 
05:42:37.110 --> 05:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
percentage points in english and 14.2
 
05:42:39.350 --> 05:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
percentage points in math
 
05:42:40.868 --> 05:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
but here's what they found that was most
 
05:42:43.270 --> 05:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
interesting i'll quote offering full
 
05:42:45.030 --> 05:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
in-person instruction rather than fully
 
05:42:47.030 --> 05:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
hybrid or virtual instruction reduces
 
05:42:49.830 --> 05:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
test score loss in math by 10.1
 
05:42:52.948 --> 05:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
percentage points on the base of 14.
 
05:42:55.990 --> 05:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
14.2 percentage points in ela the loss
 
05:42:57.990 --> 05:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
is reduced
 
05:42:59.990 --> 05:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
in fully in person settings by 3.2
 
05:43:02.070 --> 05:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
percentage points so for percentage and
 
05:43:03.110 --> 05:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
05:43:04.310 --> 05:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
so that means
 
05:43:07.270 --> 05:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
going in person reduced the learning
 
05:43:10.708 --> 05:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
loss by 71
 
05:43:14.070 --> 05:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
in math and 50 in reading
 
05:43:14.080 --> 05:43:15.270 align:start position:0%
in math and 50 in reading
that

05:43:15.270 --> 05:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:43:17.990 --> 05:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
is perfectly clear that that forcing
 
05:43:19.510 --> 05:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
families to go remote for whom it's not
 
05:43:20.628 --> 05:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
a good fit
 
05:43:22.628 --> 05:43:22.638 align:start position:0%

failing at least one class
 
05:45:31.750 --> 05:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
rose 46 percent
 
05:45:33.270 --> 05:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think i i think i typed that wrong i
 
05:45:37.030 --> 05:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
think it's 36 percent um it from the
 
05:45:39.590 --> 05:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
2019 to 2020 school year
 
05:45:41.670 --> 05:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
to the 2020 21 school year and i'll give
 
05:45:42.948 --> 05:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
you an example that i think really
 
05:45:44.310 --> 05:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
illustrates this
 
05:45:44.320 --> 05:45:45.990 align:start position:0%
illustrates this
um

05:45:45.990 --> 05:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:48.150 --> 05:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
in mclaughlin middle school
 
05:45:50.548 --> 05:45:50.558 align:start position:0%
in the 2019 and 2020 school year they
 
05:45:53.110 --> 05:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
had a single student get an f in any
 
05:45:53.120 --> 05:45:54.070 align:start position:0%
had a single student get an f in any
class

05:45:54.070 --> 05:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
class
 
05:45:55.830 --> 05:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
one f in the whole middle school in that
 
05:45:56.868 --> 05:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
school year
 
05:46:00.390 --> 05:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
in 2020 21 school year they had 234
 
05:46:03.350 --> 05:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
students get an f
 
05:46:05.350 --> 05:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
that is the impact
 
05:46:07.430 --> 05:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
and that's just academic
 
05:46:09.270 --> 05:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
now we can move to the psychological
 
05:46:11.190 --> 05:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
impact a study in chicago found that
 
05:46:12.788 --> 05:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
students experience large gains in
 
05:46:15.350 --> 05:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
feelings of anger loneliness stress and
 
05:46:17.110 --> 05:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
depression when they were forced into
 
05:46:19.910 --> 05:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
remote classes university college london
 
05:46:22.628 --> 05:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
last year did a meta-analysis of studies
 
05:46:25.190 --> 05:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
on psychological impacts i'll quote
 
05:46:26.948 --> 05:46:26.958 align:start position:0%
school closures as part of broader
 
05:46:28.230 --> 05:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
social distancing measures are
 
05:46:30.788 --> 05:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
associated with considerable harms to
 
05:46:33.110 --> 05:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
cyp that's children and young people
 
05:46:36.150 --> 05:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
health and well-being available data uh
 
05:46:38.310 --> 05:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
go through that um research i'm still
 
05:46:40.390 --> 05:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
quoting clearly indicates that remote
 
05:46:42.230 --> 05:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
learning or even a hybrid model has
 
05:46:44.230 --> 05:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
significant negative effects on children
 
05:46:47.670 --> 05:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
and parents mental emotional social and
 
05:46:49.270 --> 05:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
physical health i'm sorry that quote is
 
05:46:51.030 --> 05:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
a separate quote from psychology today
 
05:46:52.788 --> 05:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
from last august
 
05:46:52.798 --> 05:46:54.470 align:start position:0%
from last august
um

05:46:54.470 --> 05:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
still quoting psychology today
 
05:46:58.150 --> 05:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
parents of children in virtual schooling
 
05:47:00.628 --> 05:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
were also more likely to report loss of
 
05:47:02.548 --> 05:47:02.558 align:start position:0%
work emotional distress difficulty
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
sleeping and problems with finding child
 
05:47:04.080 --> 05:47:05.430 align:start position:0%
sleeping and problems with finding child
care

05:47:05.430 --> 05:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:47:07.910 --> 05:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
the findings suggest that uh in-person
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
learning may be critical to the physical
 
05:47:12.390 --> 05:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
and mental health of many families end
 
05:47:12.400 --> 05:47:15.910 align:start position:0%
and mental health of many families end
quote

05:47:15.910 --> 05:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:16.948 --> 05:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
i don't think i need to go any more on
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
the data
 
05:47:20.310 --> 05:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
what is this we know the impact on
 
05:47:20.320 --> 05:47:21.430 align:start position:0%
what is this we know the impact on
families

05:47:21.430 --> 05:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
families
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
that is directly related to the loss in
 
05:47:26.150 --> 05:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
public school students
 
05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
that we experienced
 
05:47:31.270 --> 05:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
i i can't stress enough
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
how families are frustrated by feeling
 
05:47:34.788 --> 05:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
like they don't have input and don't
 
05:47:35.910 --> 05:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
have a choice
 
05:47:37.750 --> 05:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire lost 8
 
05:47:41.430 --> 05:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
000 students in the 2020 school year
 
05:47:43.190 --> 05:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
four and a half percent of the entire
 
05:47:44.948 --> 05:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
public school population left the school
 
05:47:47.750 --> 05:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
districts and did not come back
 
05:47:51.830 --> 05:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:54.548 --> 05:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
i would associate that with a sense of
 
05:47:56.390 --> 05:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
helplessness a sense of
 
05:47:58.868 --> 05:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
loss of control a sense that things are
 
05:48:00.070 --> 05:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
being imposed on their families that
 
05:48:02.390 --> 05:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
they don't want and can't handle
 
05:48:02.400 --> 05:48:03.510 align:start position:0%
they don't want and can't handle
um

05:48:03.510 --> 05:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:04.708 --> 05:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:48:07.990 --> 05:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
this particular law the way it's written
 
05:48:10.470 --> 05:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
would allow districts to offer any
 
05:48:12.230 --> 05:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
method of instruction they want at any
 
05:48:13.910 --> 05:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
time for any reason
 
05:48:15.670 --> 05:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying school districts want to
 
05:48:16.628 --> 05:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
do this
 
05:48:19.030 --> 05:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
but what you're enabling is a district
 
05:48:20.470 --> 05:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
to go fully remote for as long as it
 
05:48:20.480 --> 05:48:21.830 align:start position:0%
to go fully remote for as long as it
wants

05:48:21.830 --> 05:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
wants
 
05:48:23.110 --> 05:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's going to happen i
 
05:48:24.788 --> 05:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
think we've seen that districts don't
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
want to go remote but in the long run as
 
05:48:29.190 --> 05:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking about population declines
 
05:48:30.470 --> 05:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about tax-based issues
 
05:48:31.830 --> 05:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about school districts
 
05:48:34.230 --> 05:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
that are shrinking you could conceivably
 
05:48:35.590 --> 05:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
have a school district particularly in
 
05:48:37.430 --> 05:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
the remote parts of the state in a few
 
05:48:39.510 --> 05:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
years or 10 years decide you know what
 
05:48:39.520 --> 05:48:40.390 align:start position:0%
years or 10 years decide you know what
um

05:48:40.390 --> 05:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:41.590 --> 05:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
the money
 
05:48:44.070 --> 05:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
makes more sense we're gonna go remote
 
05:48:45.910 --> 05:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing to prevent that
 
05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
um i think you've got to be careful with
 
05:48:49.670 --> 05:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
what you're enabling here and parents
 
05:48:51.510 --> 05:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
should have a buy-in and have a say if
 
05:48:53.190 --> 05:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
parents don't have a say
 
05:48:54.548 --> 05:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
you're just going to keep driving them
 
05:48:55.750 --> 05:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
out of the system and i don't think
 
05:48:57.590 --> 05:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's what any of us wants so that's
 
05:48:58.708 --> 05:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
why we wrote the rule the way that we
 
05:49:00.470 --> 05:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
did and i'm happy to take questions
 
05:49:03.430 --> 05:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
05:49:05.990 --> 05:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
mr klein um i'm really worried about
 
05:49:08.230 --> 05:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
where we're going with our kids when i
 
05:49:11.430 --> 05:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
me too as a trustee for the university
 
05:49:13.830 --> 05:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
system throughout america
 
05:49:16.070 --> 05:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
we've lost one million
 
05:49:20.868 --> 05:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
higher ed students in the last year yeah
 
05:49:22.948 --> 05:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
now we're doing the same on the k
 
05:49:24.868 --> 05:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
through 12 level here in our state in
 
05:49:27.350 --> 05:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
terms of figures she just gave us
 
05:49:29.510 --> 05:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to see a generation here
 
05:49:29.520 --> 05:49:31.350 align:start position:0%
we're going to see a generation here
that's

05:49:31.350 --> 05:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:49:33.270 --> 05:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
they came in with covet a high school
 
05:49:36.868 --> 05:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
student when they were maybe a freshman
 
05:49:39.190 --> 05:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
this year when they're seniors they're
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
still experiencing this they've gone all
 
05:49:43.110 --> 05:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
in and out all those years what have
 
05:49:44.470 --> 05:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
they missed
 
05:49:45.830 --> 05:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
could we not
 
05:49:47.990 --> 05:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
solve that better by requiring them to
 
05:49:51.990 --> 05:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:53.830 --> 05:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
i don't need that i'm just i'm just
 
05:49:57.990 --> 05:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
curious no we are we have a huge problem
 
05:50:01.510 --> 05:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
and um or with options like holland or
 
05:50:03.670 --> 05:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
the netherlands that you alluded to i'm
 
05:50:05.910 --> 05:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
just concerned i'm looking for how do we
 
05:50:07.830 --> 05:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
get out of this hole well and again i
 
05:50:10.628 --> 05:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
just want to reiterate reporter
 
05:50:12.628 --> 05:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
under our rules schools can close for
 
05:50:14.548 --> 05:50:14.558 align:start position:0%
health and safety releases literally no
 
05:50:16.310 --> 05:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
prohibition whatsoever if they want to
 
05:50:17.830 --> 05:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
close they can close
 
05:50:17.840 --> 05:50:18.868 align:start position:0%
close they can close
that's

05:50:18.868 --> 05:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:50:21.030 --> 05:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
the difference is why would you force
 
05:50:23.910 --> 05:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
families the most vulnerable families
 
05:50:26.070 --> 05:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
that we demonstrated with data in new
 
05:50:26.080 --> 05:50:28.708 align:start position:0%
that we demonstrated with data in new
hampshire

05:50:28.708 --> 05:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:30.548 --> 05:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
have had devastating consequences from
 
05:50:32.708 --> 05:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
remote learning
 
05:50:33.910 --> 05:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
the question is not where the schools
 
05:50:36.548 --> 05:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
can close schools can close the question
 
05:50:36.558 --> 05:50:37.590 align:start position:0%
can close schools can close the question
is

05:50:37.590 --> 05:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:50:39.430 --> 05:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
when they're closed for these reasons
 
05:50:43.670 --> 05:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
are we going to force families who can't
 
05:50:43.680 --> 05:50:44.708 align:start position:0%
are we going to force families who can't
easily

05:50:44.708 --> 05:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
easily
 
05:50:46.310 --> 05:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
manage remote learning
 
05:50:48.230 --> 05:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
into remote learning that's the question
 
05:50:49.750 --> 05:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
and what we're saying is no you
 
05:50:51.670 --> 05:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do that you should offer them
 
05:50:54.470 --> 05:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
a day in person at the end of the year
 
05:50:55.990 --> 05:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's right i just have one follow-up
 
05:50:57.990 --> 05:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know let the committee have it okay
 
05:50:58.000 --> 05:50:58.788 align:start position:0%
you know let the committee have it okay
so

05:50:58.788 --> 05:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:00.390 --> 05:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay i've gone through it with remote
 
05:51:03.350 --> 05:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
learning with our our grandkids
 
05:51:03.360 --> 05:51:04.628 align:start position:0%
learning with our our grandkids
and

05:51:04.628 --> 05:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:51:07.270 --> 05:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
has the department looked at what is
 
05:51:09.910 --> 05:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
remote learning is it just the giving of
 
05:51:11.350 --> 05:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
assignment and say kid you're on your
 
05:51:13.590 --> 05:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
own get it done and then hammer into the
 
05:51:16.708 --> 05:51:16.718 align:start position:0%
computer your your answers etc
 
05:51:18.390 --> 05:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
i saw that
 
05:51:21.430 --> 05:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
with one of my youngsters all last year
 
05:51:22.868 --> 05:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
that's not supposed to happen
 
05:51:24.708 --> 05:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
technically remote instruct it's called
 
05:51:26.470 --> 05:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
remote instruction and it's supposed to
 
05:51:28.070 --> 05:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
be instruction
 
05:51:30.548 --> 05:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
so um technically under the rules you're
 
05:51:32.628 --> 05:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
not supposed to just
 
05:51:34.868 --> 05:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
give kids an assignment and then like
 
05:51:36.150 --> 05:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
turn off the screen and have them do it
 
05:51:38.150 --> 05:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be live
 
05:51:39.750 --> 05:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
teacher and so it can be recorded but
 
05:51:41.350 --> 05:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be instruction so
 
05:51:42.948 --> 05:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
that's that's how it's supposed to work
 
05:51:45.670 --> 05:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
kids have a um a right under the rules
 
05:51:47.030 --> 05:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
um to
 
05:51:49.030 --> 05:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
to be instructed
 
05:51:51.190 --> 05:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
not just to be sent home homework packet
 
05:51:53.030 --> 05:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'm pleased to hear that yeah um
 
05:51:53.990 --> 05:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:51:54.948 --> 05:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
representative waltz and then
 
05:51:54.958 --> 05:51:55.910 align:start position:0%
representative waltz and then
representative

05:51:55.910 --> 05:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:51:58.470 --> 05:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
and then anybody on that side thank you
 
05:52:00.390 --> 05:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
mr client i don't think there's a member
 
05:52:02.548 --> 05:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
of this committee i don't think there is
 
05:52:04.868 --> 05:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
an administrator in their state i don't
 
05:52:06.830 --> 05:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
think there's anybody that's a serious
 
05:52:09.350 --> 05:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
educator that disagree that remote
 
05:52:11.030 --> 05:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
learning is not the best approach for
 
05:52:11.040 --> 05:52:12.150 align:start position:0%
learning is not the best approach for
kids

05:52:12.150 --> 05:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
kids
 
05:52:12.160 --> 05:52:13.270 align:start position:0%
kids
however

05:52:13.270 --> 05:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:52:15.110 --> 05:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is
 
05:52:16.708 --> 05:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
allowing a district to have local
 
05:52:19.990 --> 05:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
control under emergency circumstances
 
05:52:22.150 --> 05:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
and you have set up a straw man here
 
05:52:24.548 --> 05:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
talking about oh maybe in 10 years some
 
05:52:26.070 --> 05:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
remote some northern districts want to
 
05:52:27.990 --> 05:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
go remote full-time we are not
 
05:52:29.590 --> 05:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
legislating for 10 years from now we're
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
religious heading for today we're
 
05:52:32.548 --> 05:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
legislating from the middle of a
 
05:52:35.750 --> 05:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic and i'm confused as to why it's
 
05:52:37.670 --> 05:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
not better for our children
 
05:52:39.430 --> 05:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
and better for our districts to have
 
05:52:41.910 --> 05:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
local control let them shut for two
 
05:52:44.470 --> 05:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
three or four days rather than as
 
05:52:46.150 --> 05:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
representative porter talked about
 
05:52:48.788 --> 05:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
warehousing them in a cafeteria with no
 
05:52:50.470 --> 05:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
educational instruction
 
05:52:52.470 --> 05:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
why it isn't better to let them be
 
05:52:54.548 --> 05:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
online for a couple of days
 
05:52:56.788 --> 05:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
actually have educational instruction
 
05:52:56.798 --> 05:52:58.070 align:start position:0%
actually have educational instruction
remotely

05:52:58.070 --> 05:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
05:53:00.150 --> 05:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
why it's better
 
05:53:02.230 --> 05:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
to just pile on the days have them have
 
05:53:04.788 --> 05:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
to go to july first have them have to do
 
05:53:06.708 --> 05:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
something because we're in the middle of
 
05:53:08.708 --> 05:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
a pandemic this is an unusual set of
 
05:53:11.910 --> 05:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances my question to you is why
 
05:53:14.548 --> 05:53:14.558 align:start position:0%
in this extraordinary time are we taking
 
05:53:17.110 --> 05:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
away local control when i think the
 
05:53:19.750 --> 05:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
local districts know best what's best
 
05:53:21.830 --> 05:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
for their students
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
um okay well if i can just go back to my
 
05:53:25.750 --> 05:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
points about the devastating
 
05:53:27.270 --> 05:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
catastrophic impacts of remote
 
05:53:28.708 --> 05:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
instruction that's what we're talking
 
05:53:31.590 --> 05:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
about so again
 
05:53:33.350 --> 05:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
nothing in this role i'll just keep
 
05:53:35.190 --> 05:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
saying it um nothing in this rule
 
05:53:37.350 --> 05:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
prevents a school from closing whether
 
05:53:39.430 --> 05:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's for staffing shortages whether they
 
05:53:42.070 --> 05:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
if a school says well gosh um we have to
 
05:53:43.670 --> 05:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
warehouse five kids here and we can't
 
05:53:45.350 --> 05:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
instruct them the school can close we're
 
05:53:48.310 --> 05:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
not preventing that
 
05:53:50.070 --> 05:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
i just i'm not sure that's getting
 
05:53:50.080 --> 05:53:50.868 align:start position:0%
i just i'm not sure that's getting
through

05:53:50.868 --> 05:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:53:52.390 --> 05:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
we're not preventing schools from
 
05:53:52.400 --> 05:53:53.430 align:start position:0%
we're not preventing schools from
closing

05:53:53.430 --> 05:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
closing
 
05:53:55.030 --> 05:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is
 
05:53:58.868 --> 05:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
if a school decides to close
 
05:54:00.868 --> 05:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
it can't force remote instruction on
 
05:54:02.948 --> 05:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
families who don't request it
 
05:54:03.990 --> 05:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
05:54:04.000 --> 05:54:05.270 align:start position:0%
and that's
because

05:54:05.270 --> 05:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:54:07.110 --> 05:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
we have seen the devastating impacts of
 
05:54:08.788 --> 05:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
remote instruction on families that
 
05:54:08.798 --> 05:54:09.670 align:start position:0%
remote instruction on families that
aren't

05:54:09.670 --> 05:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
05:54:12.230 --> 05:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
able to handle it and so i think the
 
05:54:14.868 --> 05:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
question is whether districts are going
 
05:54:14.878 --> 05:54:17.750 align:start position:0%
question is whether districts are going
to

05:54:17.750 --> 05:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:18.948 --> 05:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
use that
 
05:54:21.830 --> 05:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
that closure time to offer instruction
 
05:54:24.230 --> 05:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
method that we know at scale is
 
05:54:26.390 --> 05:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
inadequate and causes lots of damage and
 
05:54:29.430 --> 05:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
harm we know that the data are clear
 
05:54:31.190 --> 05:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why we want to put kids and
 
05:54:32.708 --> 05:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
families in that situation so what we're
 
05:54:34.868 --> 05:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
saying is instead of that situation
 
05:54:37.990 --> 05:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
close the school now if you need to
 
05:54:40.070 --> 05:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
but treat it like an old-fashioned snow
 
05:54:41.510 --> 05:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
day and just add it at the end of the
 
05:54:43.590 --> 05:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
year that's that's all we're saying so
 
05:54:45.270 --> 05:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
the kids have access to the in-person
 
05:54:47.430 --> 05:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
instructions so those poor low-income
 
05:54:49.590 --> 05:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged families that have a hard
 
05:54:52.230 --> 05:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
time managing remote instruction can go
 
05:54:54.150 --> 05:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
to school in person we want to make sure
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
they have access to in-person
 
05:54:57.830 --> 05:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
instruction and they're not cheated
 
05:54:59.270 --> 05:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know by the remote instruction that
 
05:55:00.788 --> 05:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
has been demonstrated and not worked for
 
05:55:00.798 --> 05:55:01.670 align:start position:0%
has been demonstrated and not worked for
them

05:55:01.670 --> 05:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:55:03.990 --> 05:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
but isn't it a duplicitous position to
 
05:55:06.390 --> 05:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
say yes it's okay to have remote
 
05:55:08.868 --> 05:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
instruction for a snow day but not for a
 
05:55:11.030 --> 05:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
covet day not really
 
05:55:14.230 --> 05:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
well as i explained in the beginning um
 
05:55:15.510 --> 05:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
that is to be consistent with the
 
05:55:17.910 --> 05:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
pre-existing blizzard bag rule so we
 
05:55:19.430 --> 05:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
didn't want to change that rule we were
 
05:55:21.350 --> 05:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
trying to make that rule consistent so
 
05:55:23.430 --> 05:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
we can continue to do that that's all it
 
05:55:25.350 --> 05:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
was um
 
05:55:25.360 --> 05:55:26.788 align:start position:0%
was um
okay

05:55:26.788 --> 05:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:55:28.788 --> 05:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
okay uh next question was coming down
 
05:55:30.788 --> 05:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
the line was you representing yes go
 
05:55:33.430 --> 05:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you very much uh mr chair
 
05:55:35.670 --> 05:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
and um and um uh chairman of the state
 
05:55:38.470 --> 05:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
board for uh for taking my question
 
05:55:38.480 --> 05:55:39.190 align:start position:0%
board for uh for taking my question
um

05:55:39.190 --> 05:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:41.270 --> 05:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the um
 
05:55:44.708 --> 05:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
at the rule proposal that went to the um
 
05:55:46.230 --> 05:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
to the state board
 
05:55:48.628 --> 05:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
and for 306 22 which i think is the rule
 
05:55:50.470 --> 05:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
you cited um
 
05:55:51.910 --> 05:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
i think that's where it is yeah i think
 
05:55:53.350 --> 05:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
they'll touch your side i looked it up
 
05:55:55.750 --> 05:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
and it's yeah it is where it is
 
05:55:55.760 --> 05:55:56.948 align:start position:0%
and it's yeah it is where it is
um

05:55:56.948 --> 05:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:58.310 --> 05:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:56:02.150 --> 05:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:03.590 --> 05:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
05:56:03.600 --> 05:56:05.430 align:start position:0%
in the uh
materials

05:56:05.430 --> 05:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
materials
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
in the draft of that rule
 
05:56:12.868 --> 05:56:12.878 align:start position:0%
cite um rsa 21n and rsa 186 8
 
05:56:15.350 --> 05:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
roman 1 and 2 as being the um the
 
05:56:17.190 --> 05:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
underpinning statute for that both are
 
05:56:19.190 --> 05:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
rule making statues for the state board
 
05:56:22.310 --> 05:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
of education so i certainly see how
 
05:56:25.350 --> 05:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
those two rules are relevant but
 
05:56:27.510 --> 05:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
in um in sort of digging around in our
 
05:56:28.948 --> 05:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
new books here
 
05:56:34.548 --> 05:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
um i came across another rsa 189 colon 1
 
05:56:37.430 --> 05:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
which talks about days in school
 
05:56:40.628 --> 05:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
and then 189 colon 1a which talks about
 
05:56:43.110 --> 05:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
duty to provide education
 
05:56:45.510 --> 05:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
and days in school says the school board
 
05:56:47.670 --> 05:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
of every district shall provide
 
05:56:50.230 --> 05:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah
 
05:56:53.190 --> 05:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know education 180 hours
 
05:56:55.110 --> 05:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
sorry 180 days or the equivalent number
 
05:56:57.030 --> 05:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
of hours
 
05:56:59.270 --> 05:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
at such places in the quote at such
 
05:57:00.948 --> 05:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
places in the district as will best
 
05:57:02.628 --> 05:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
serve the interests of education and
 
05:57:02.638 --> 05:57:03.430 align:start position:0%
serve the interests of education and
give

05:57:03.430 --> 05:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
give
 
05:57:05.590 --> 05:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
to all the pupils within the district as
 
05:57:07.910 --> 05:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
nearly equal advantages as are
 
05:57:07.920 --> 05:57:10.310 align:start position:0%
nearly equal advantages as are
practicable

05:57:10.310 --> 05:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
practicable
 
05:57:15.990 --> 05:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
and 189 colon 1a goes on to to read this
 
05:57:18.470 --> 05:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
is roman 1 it shall be the duty of the
 
05:57:20.150 --> 05:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
school board too
 
05:57:22.310 --> 05:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
and it talks about providing education
 
05:57:24.390 --> 05:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
to students until they reach an age of
 
05:57:26.868 --> 05:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
of 21.
 
05:57:28.948 --> 05:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
roman 2
 
05:57:31.190 --> 05:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:57:33.590 --> 05:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
school boards shall be responsible uh
 
05:57:35.670 --> 05:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
for establishing
 
05:57:37.590 --> 05:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
the structure accountability advocacy
 
05:57:41.750 --> 05:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:43.510 --> 05:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
to accomplish this end and to support
 
05:57:45.190 --> 05:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility in implementing diverse
 
05:57:46.788 --> 05:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
educational approaches school board
 
05:57:49.190 --> 05:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
shall establish an each school board
 
05:57:51.430 --> 05:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
in each school operated and governed in
 
05:57:55.350 --> 05:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
the district instructional policies
 
05:57:57.350 --> 05:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
and then and then it goes on to roman
 
05:57:59.990 --> 05:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
three um school boards again
 
05:58:01.910 --> 05:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities of school boards
 
05:58:04.390 --> 05:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and so my question to you um mr
 
05:58:08.708 --> 05:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
chair is um is under you know how the
 
05:58:12.708 --> 05:58:12.718 align:start position:0%
how the rule that the board has adopted
 
05:58:12.718 --> 05:58:13.628 align:start position:0%
how the rule that the board has adopted
um

05:58:13.628 --> 05:58:13.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:13.638 --> 05:58:15.190 align:start position:0%
um
306

05:58:15.190 --> 05:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
306
 
05:58:15.200 --> 05:58:18.470 align:start position:0%
306
um

05:58:18.470 --> 05:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:21.830 --> 05:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
is uh not in conflict with uh with with
 
05:58:24.708 --> 05:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
the statutes found in 189 colon um yeah
 
05:58:26.470 --> 05:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
we looked at those statutes and we had
 
05:58:28.390 --> 05:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
our attorney uh go through them and and
 
05:58:29.910 --> 05:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
i think the conclusion that we came to
 
05:58:31.510 --> 05:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
was that they're not in conflict and
 
05:58:32.948 --> 05:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
that we did have the authority to write
 
05:58:35.110 --> 05:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
this rule specifying the method of
 
05:58:37.350 --> 05:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
instruction i mean if you look at 189 i
 
05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't remember the exact dashing on at
 
05:58:42.628 --> 05:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
such places in the district i mean that
 
05:58:45.830 --> 05:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
is a obviously pre-pandemic uh law and
 
05:58:47.590 --> 05:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
its pre-remote instruction law they
 
05:58:49.830 --> 05:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate the technology
 
05:58:49.840 --> 05:58:50.868 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate the technology
um

05:58:50.868 --> 05:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:53.270 --> 05:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
and yet i i think the way it's written
 
05:58:55.830 --> 05:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
is pretty clear the intent is the the
 
05:58:57.270 --> 05:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
education would be physical in a
 
05:58:58.788 --> 05:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
physical location so you could make an
 
05:59:01.590 --> 05:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
argument that that law in itself
 
05:59:03.510 --> 05:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
forbids remote instruction
 
05:59:05.670 --> 05:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
um because it is not necessarily at a
 
05:59:07.430 --> 05:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
place in the district where the kids can
 
05:59:10.310 --> 05:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
come to so we we did go sort of work
 
05:59:12.310 --> 05:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
through all of that stuff and uh you
 
05:59:13.910 --> 05:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
know our conclusion was that we did have
 
05:59:15.430 --> 05:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
the authority to write this rule on the
 
05:59:18.310 --> 05:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
method of instruction there so follow up
 
05:59:19.750 --> 05:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
on that mr sure
 
05:59:24.708 --> 05:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
yes um the um um 189 colon one was at
 
05:59:26.628 --> 05:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
least according to this book updated as
 
05:59:30.070 --> 05:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
recently as 2017.
 
05:59:32.628 --> 05:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic but certainly post-distance
 
05:59:32.638 --> 05:59:33.670 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic but certainly post-distance
learning

05:59:33.670 --> 05:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
learning
 
05:59:35.830 --> 05:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
and and i mean distance learning's been
 
05:59:38.868 --> 05:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
in place for decades right and i think
 
05:59:41.030 --> 05:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to interrupt no no no no
 
05:59:43.270 --> 05:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
as a result let me go ahead let me let
 
05:59:46.070 --> 05:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
me continue sure um
 
05:59:49.350 --> 05:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
and so i guess i'm i'm i'm wondering
 
05:59:51.830 --> 05:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
about your interpretation or the board's
 
05:59:54.948 --> 05:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
interpretation of 189 colon one right uh
 
05:59:57.590 --> 05:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
when it refers specifically to quote and
 
05:59:59.750 --> 05:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
delivery of instruction because you use
 
06:00:03.270 --> 06:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
it unquote you use the word methods of
 
06:00:05.510 --> 06:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
or method of instruction which i think
 
06:00:07.270 --> 06:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
is different than delivery of
 
06:00:10.310 --> 06:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
instruction maybe and and um and
 
06:00:14.310 --> 06:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
you know in in my lay read right of this
 
06:00:14.320 --> 06:00:15.670 align:start position:0%
you know in in my lay read right of this
um

06:00:15.670 --> 06:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:19.670 --> 06:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
i i would interpret delivery as as
 
06:00:22.390 --> 06:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
meaning how it's delivered as opposed to
 
06:00:25.510 --> 06:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
the the pedagogy so i'd like if you
 
06:00:27.350 --> 06:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
could sort of expand on maybe what the
 
06:00:29.110 --> 06:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
board's considerations were yeah
 
06:00:29.120 --> 06:00:30.070 align:start position:0%
board's considerations were yeah
honestly

06:00:30.070 --> 06:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
06:00:31.830 --> 06:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the question and i
 
06:00:33.430 --> 06:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate the thoroughness of your
 
06:00:35.590 --> 06:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
review there and i do think um the the
 
06:00:37.270 --> 06:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
fact that that was from 2017 would sort
 
06:00:39.750 --> 06:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
of bolster my argument that um it's
 
06:00:41.510 --> 06:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
clearly a word in a way that anticipates
 
06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
in-person instruction in a physical
 
06:00:46.070 --> 06:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
location which is how we looked at it um
 
06:00:46.080 --> 06:00:47.190 align:start position:0%
location which is how we looked at it um
so

06:00:47.190 --> 06:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:48.548 --> 06:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
06:00:50.150 --> 06:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
kind of addresses that issue but in
 
06:00:51.830 --> 06:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
terms of um
 
06:00:52.948 --> 06:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
you know our authority and our
 
06:00:56.628 --> 06:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority um i i'm not gonna
 
06:00:58.470 --> 06:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
try to remember all of our conversations
 
06:01:00.390 --> 06:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
we had with our attorneys going through
 
06:01:02.470 --> 06:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
the legal um place
 
06:01:04.390 --> 06:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
but it was definitely something we
 
06:01:06.708 --> 06:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
looked at and our conclusion was that we
 
06:01:10.230 --> 06:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:12.628 --> 06:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
okay if there's can we try to bring this
 
06:01:14.390 --> 06:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
one down to a close because we're
 
06:01:15.910 --> 06:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
falling farther and farther behind we
 
06:01:17.830 --> 06:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
have some folks that are waiting for
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
several bills which are in front of us
 
06:01:21.350 --> 06:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
still so if it's a serious question i'm
 
06:01:22.628 --> 06:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
not a serious quote but a question that
 
06:01:24.150 --> 06:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
has to be answered now
 
06:01:26.788 --> 06:01:26.798 align:start position:0%
if you could get it from drew afterwards
 
06:01:30.150 --> 06:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
or ask it now either way
 
06:01:32.470 --> 06:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh thank you for taking my
 
06:01:35.110 --> 06:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
question sure uh i believe the blizzard
 
06:01:36.548 --> 06:01:36.558 align:start position:0%
bags actually were developed at
 
06:01:39.750 --> 06:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
kearsarge and then uh spread across the
 
06:01:42.230 --> 06:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
state so uh thank you for mentioning
 
06:01:43.830 --> 06:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
that and thank you for mentioning the
 
06:01:45.270 --> 06:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
fact that uh
 
06:01:48.708 --> 06:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
you know uh schools um with certified
 
06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
teachers are the best place for kids to
 
06:01:50.400 --> 06:01:51.350 align:start position:0%
teachers are the best place for kids to
learn

06:01:51.350 --> 06:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
learn
 
06:01:52.708 --> 06:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
i don't think i mentioned just to be
 
06:01:54.230 --> 06:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
clear i didn't say anything about it
 
06:01:56.390 --> 06:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
would like to say that
 
06:01:59.030 --> 06:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
that one of the things uh one of or the
 
06:02:01.430 --> 06:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
question is the blizzard bags offer
 
06:02:03.830 --> 06:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
consistency in other words
 
06:02:06.310 --> 06:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
we have snow days and and we've had snow
 
06:02:08.390 --> 06:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
days for a long time but they developed
 
06:02:10.230 --> 06:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
these blizzard bags because kids would
 
06:02:10.240 --> 06:02:11.030 align:start position:0%
these blizzard bags because kids would
miss

06:02:11.030 --> 06:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
miss
 
06:02:13.190 --> 06:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
a couple of days right and not do
 
06:02:14.548 --> 06:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
anything and then come back and the
 
06:02:17.110 --> 06:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
blizzard bags gave them consistency
 
06:02:19.910 --> 06:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't you see that having remote
 
06:02:19.920 --> 06:02:21.350 align:start position:0%
don't you see that having remote
learning

06:02:21.350 --> 06:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
learning
 
06:02:24.548 --> 06:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
on days when schools may have to close
 
06:02:26.548 --> 06:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
would also offer some level of
 
06:02:26.558 --> 06:02:28.230 align:start position:0%
would also offer some level of
consistency

06:02:28.230 --> 06:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
consistency
 
06:02:30.390 --> 06:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
that would be better than just say
 
06:02:32.868 --> 06:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
don't have school make it up in june
 
06:02:34.150 --> 06:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
um yeah thank you i appreciate the
 
06:02:35.910 --> 06:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
question we actually uh talked about
 
06:02:38.628 --> 06:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
that a lot and in the rulemaking process
 
06:02:40.868 --> 06:02:40.878 align:start position:0%
we did get some feedback from um
 
06:02:43.190 --> 06:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
from some superintendents who suggested
 
06:02:44.628 --> 06:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
that that was
 
06:02:47.190 --> 06:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
the reason like the one reason to to go
 
06:02:47.200 --> 06:02:48.310 align:start position:0%
the reason like the one reason to to go
remote

06:02:48.310 --> 06:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
remote
 
06:02:50.310 --> 06:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
in those close days was for consistency
 
06:02:50.320 --> 06:02:51.750 align:start position:0%
in those close days was for consistency
purposes

06:02:51.750 --> 06:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
06:02:53.750 --> 06:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
and we did seriously consider that and
 
06:02:55.750 --> 06:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
our calculation was that on balance
 
06:02:57.430 --> 06:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
based on the data we had
 
06:03:00.150 --> 06:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
of seeing the catastrophic uh impacts
 
06:03:01.350 --> 06:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
psychologically emotionally and
 
06:03:03.110 --> 06:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
academically on students for prolonged
 
06:03:05.430 --> 06:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
remote learning that
 
06:03:07.750 --> 06:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
we decided to strike a balance there the
 
06:03:10.708 --> 06:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
snow days and blizzard bag portion um it
 
06:03:13.270 --> 06:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
was our calculus that those are really
 
06:03:15.110 --> 06:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
short periods you usually don't close
 
06:03:16.788 --> 06:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
for a snow day for more than a couple of
 
06:03:18.548 --> 06:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
days it doesn't usually drag out long
 
06:03:22.230 --> 06:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
periods and so um we were willing to
 
06:03:23.830 --> 06:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
have the continuity there
 
06:03:25.110 --> 06:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
but for the
 
06:03:27.190 --> 06:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
sort of nebulous any other reason to
 
06:03:28.788 --> 06:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
close um
 
06:03:30.150 --> 06:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
we just felt like the impacts on
 
06:03:32.548 --> 06:03:32.558 align:start position:0%
students were too negative
 
06:03:35.190 --> 06:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
to allow that and um
 
06:03:36.788 --> 06:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
uh there was another point i was i was
 
06:03:37.990 --> 06:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
going to make on that but i think i'll
 
06:03:38.000 --> 06:03:38.788 align:start position:0%
going to make on that but i think i'll
just

06:03:38.788 --> 06:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:03:40.230 --> 06:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
run it out of time
 
06:03:42.868 --> 06:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
thank you uh represent mullin thank you
 
06:03:44.948 --> 06:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:03:48.150 --> 06:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
question chairman kline so um what
 
06:03:48.160 --> 06:03:49.270 align:start position:0%
question chairman kline so um what
advice

06:03:49.270 --> 06:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
advice
 
06:03:51.110 --> 06:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
would you or the state board of
 
06:03:54.310 --> 06:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
education have for a school district in
 
06:03:56.948 --> 06:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
which there literally were not enough
 
06:04:00.788 --> 06:04:00.798 align:start position:0%
bodies to open on a given day close
 
06:04:04.628 --> 06:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
and just worry about running out of june
 
06:04:04.638 --> 06:04:05.830 align:start position:0%
and just worry about running out of june
later

06:04:05.830 --> 06:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
later
 
06:04:07.670 --> 06:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
look if you have to close you have to
 
06:04:09.590 --> 06:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
close just like a snow day and you know
 
06:04:10.948 --> 06:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
the school districts are required to
 
06:04:12.470 --> 06:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
build a certain number of hours into the
 
06:04:14.070 --> 06:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
calendar year to take the days on at the
 
06:04:15.990 --> 06:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
end we have not had a heavy winter i
 
06:04:17.590 --> 06:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
don't know that we've had any full snow
 
06:04:19.110 --> 06:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
days maybe there's some districts that
 
06:04:21.670 --> 06:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
have um
 
06:04:21.680 --> 06:04:23.110 align:start position:0%
have um
but

06:04:23.110 --> 06:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:04:25.190 --> 06:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know again we're trying to do what's
 
06:04:27.430 --> 06:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
best for the students and based on the
 
06:04:29.110 --> 06:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
data we have
 
06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
the clearly best thing for the students
 
06:04:32.948 --> 06:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
is to be in class and learning in the
 
06:04:35.030 --> 06:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
building rather than uh particularly for
 
06:04:36.310 --> 06:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable students and that's
 
06:04:38.230 --> 06:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
what we tried to strike that balance
 
06:04:38.240 --> 06:04:39.030 align:start position:0%
what we tried to strike that balance
there

06:04:39.030 --> 06:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:04:41.430 --> 06:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you yep jefferson hall you had a
 
06:04:43.750 --> 06:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
hand up just a quick one actually thank
 
06:04:45.510 --> 06:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
you mr chair sure and thank you for
 
06:04:47.510 --> 06:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question so what happens in
 
06:04:48.390 --> 06:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
june so
 
06:04:48.400 --> 06:04:49.510 align:start position:0%
june so
[Music]

06:04:49.510 --> 06:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:04:51.350 --> 06:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
they decide to have to close school like
 
06:04:52.548 --> 06:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
you say they have a right to culture
 
06:04:55.110 --> 06:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
will they close it come june 30th
 
06:04:57.430 --> 06:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
they haven't gotten their 180 days now
 
06:04:58.548 --> 06:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
06:04:58.558 --> 06:04:59.350 align:start position:0%
what happens
um

06:04:59.350 --> 06:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:02.470 --> 06:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
so under the existing lawn rule
 
06:05:05.110 --> 06:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
if it happens and again i don't think
 
06:05:06.868 --> 06:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
we're running that risk this winter we
 
06:05:08.230 --> 06:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
haven't had
 
06:05:09.910 --> 06:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
a severe winter we haven't had a lot of
 
06:05:11.830 --> 06:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
school closures for covid so i don't
 
06:05:13.030 --> 06:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
think we're
 
06:05:15.350 --> 06:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to run that risk but if a a
 
06:05:17.110 --> 06:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
district say had attacked three weeks
 
06:05:18.868 --> 06:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
onto the end of the school year and they
 
06:05:20.948 --> 06:05:20.958 align:start position:0%
ran up against that um
 
06:05:22.310 --> 06:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
they are able to come to the department
 
06:05:25.350 --> 06:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
and get a waiver of instructional hours
 
06:05:28.070 --> 06:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
and um and we granted one waiver during
 
06:05:30.310 --> 06:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
the pandemic um
 
06:05:32.948 --> 06:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
so that that is an option if your
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
contract doesn't allow you to continue i
 
06:05:35.990 --> 06:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
mean i
 
06:05:37.270 --> 06:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know my personal preference would be
 
06:05:41.510 --> 06:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:43.430 --> 06:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
i guess i was thinking when you have the
 
06:05:45.270 --> 06:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
teacher contracts teachers end on june
 
06:05:47.350 --> 06:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
30th so it does impact student learning
 
06:05:49.510 --> 06:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
it could it could but we again just we
 
06:05:51.030 --> 06:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
have the data to show the remote
 
06:05:51.040 --> 06:05:52.070 align:start position:0%
have the data to show the remote
learning

06:05:52.070 --> 06:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
learning
 
06:05:54.470 --> 06:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
impact okay not seeing any further hands
 
06:05:55.910 --> 06:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
here we're going to close this hearing
 
06:05:57.590 --> 06:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
right here and get ready for the next
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:12.958 --> 06:06:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
materials

06:06:25.990 --> 06:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:28.548 --> 06:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
would you open this one up please i i
 
06:06:34.150 --> 06:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:43.590 --> 06:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:57.350 --> 06:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:57.360 --> 06:07:06.070 align:start position:0%
 
oh

06:07:06.070 --> 06:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:06.080 --> 06:07:20.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:07:20.150 --> 06:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:22.868 --> 06:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
thank you all i think we're ready for uh
 
06:07:23.990 --> 06:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
our next
 
06:07:24.000 --> 06:07:24.948 align:start position:0%
our next
hearing

06:07:24.948 --> 06:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:07:27.390 --> 06:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
which is house bill
 
06:07:30.948 --> 06:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
1434 relative to the availability of
 
06:07:34.150 --> 06:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
school curriculum materials
 
06:07:37.190 --> 06:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
and i see the prime sponsor
 
06:07:37.200 --> 06:07:38.628 align:start position:0%
and i see the prime sponsor
already

06:07:38.628 --> 06:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
already
 
06:07:40.548 --> 06:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
and i welcome
 
06:07:42.868 --> 06:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
representative mcbryan
 
06:07:46.230 --> 06:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon i'm really excited to
 
06:07:50.070 --> 06:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:52.788 --> 06:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
all right so this bill came to
 
06:07:55.670 --> 06:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
mind for me over the summer
 
06:07:59.350 --> 06:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
when a few things came together
 
06:08:01.430 --> 06:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
my name is catherine prudom o'brien and
 
06:08:02.948 --> 06:08:02.958 align:start position:0%
i am from derry
 
06:08:05.270 --> 06:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
and i was just going and i'm a former
 
06:08:08.150 --> 06:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
library trustee and i was going through
 
06:08:08.160 --> 06:08:09.510 align:start position:0%
library trustee and i was going through
some

06:08:09.510 --> 06:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
06:08:12.708 --> 06:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
old library minutes library trustee
 
06:08:16.310 --> 06:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
minutes and i got them as
 
06:08:16.320 --> 06:08:17.670 align:start position:0%
minutes and i got them as
is

06:08:17.670 --> 06:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:08:19.670 --> 06:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
in adherence with state law they are
 
06:08:21.990 --> 06:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
displayed at the library or you could
 
06:08:25.750 --> 06:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
ask the librarians for them if you want
 
06:08:28.070 --> 06:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
and at the same time that i was looking
 
06:08:30.628 --> 06:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
through these old library trustee
 
06:08:32.708 --> 06:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
minutes to find out about some issue
 
06:08:37.270 --> 06:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
with the library i also noticed um
 
06:08:40.150 --> 06:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
some people that i know were trying to
 
06:08:42.230 --> 06:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
get more information about the
 
06:08:44.390 --> 06:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum in their community
 
06:08:47.230 --> 06:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
and were having some trouble with it and
 
06:08:50.390 --> 06:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the person the people were
 
06:08:52.070 --> 06:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
were feeling some
 
06:08:54.070 --> 06:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
animosity and they were feeling on the
 
06:08:56.390 --> 06:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
defense now that may have been perceived
 
06:08:58.310 --> 06:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
it may have been factual i don't know
 
06:09:00.628 --> 06:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
but the point is they felt that they
 
06:09:02.390 --> 06:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
felt that trying to get information
 
06:09:05.030 --> 06:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
about the curriculum
 
06:09:06.868 --> 06:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
was uh putting they were they were on
 
06:09:09.110 --> 06:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
the defensive so
 
06:09:10.788 --> 06:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
i thought that was rather unfortunate
 
06:09:13.750 --> 06:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i thought about all the reasons why
 
06:09:16.070 --> 06:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
this curriculum that the curriculum that
 
06:09:18.628 --> 06:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
is used in public schools should be as
 
06:09:20.150 --> 06:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
transparent as
 
06:09:22.070 --> 06:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
library trustee minutes you should be
 
06:09:23.590 --> 06:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
able to go
 
06:09:23.600 --> 06:09:24.548 align:start position:0%
able to go
and

06:09:24.548 --> 06:09:24.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:27.670 --> 06:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
read a notebook that explains the
 
06:09:29.990 --> 06:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum that is used in the schools
 
06:09:31.750 --> 06:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
in your community
 
06:09:31.760 --> 06:09:33.430 align:start position:0%
in your community
and

06:09:33.430 --> 06:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:35.350 --> 06:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
this bill also
 
06:09:37.510 --> 06:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
allows for it to be online i know some
 
06:09:38.868 --> 06:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
communities don't have that but it would
 
06:09:40.310 --> 06:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
be both and then
 
06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
also in a notebook form at a charter
 
06:09:45.830 --> 06:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
school which is a kind of public school
 
06:09:48.230 --> 06:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
as well as i'm sure you know
 
06:09:50.868 --> 06:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
um i try to keep this bill as simple as
 
06:09:52.470 --> 06:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
possible so that it would not be
 
06:09:54.390 --> 06:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
difficult for school personnel to
 
06:09:56.548 --> 06:09:56.558 align:start position:0%
provide this information
 
06:09:56.558 --> 06:09:58.628 align:start position:0%
provide this information
now

06:09:58.628 --> 06:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:10:00.788 --> 06:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
i don't think this would really be extra
 
06:10:03.350 --> 06:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
work my own opinion on that because
 
06:10:05.670 --> 06:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
if i was a teacher at us at a public
 
06:10:05.680 --> 06:10:07.030 align:start position:0%
if i was a teacher at us at a public
school

06:10:07.030 --> 06:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:10:09.750 --> 06:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
i would have to have some sort of
 
06:10:11.910 --> 06:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
framework some sort of curriculum no
 
06:10:14.070 --> 06:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
matter what first grade 12th grade it
 
06:10:18.868 --> 06:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:20.310 --> 06:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is because i
 
06:10:22.548 --> 06:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
couldn't just start the school year and
 
06:10:25.590 --> 06:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
say to the principal
 
06:10:28.230 --> 06:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to teach you know whatever
 
06:10:30.788 --> 06:10:30.798 align:start position:0%
this year no i would assume that every
 
06:10:32.390 --> 06:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
teacher has
 
06:10:34.230 --> 06:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
some framework a curriculum that they
 
06:10:35.990 --> 06:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
have written down
 
06:10:39.270 --> 06:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
and that when that already exists
 
06:10:41.110 --> 06:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
and that the principal or the curriculum
 
06:10:42.948 --> 06:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
committee has that when that already
 
06:10:45.830 --> 06:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
exists it's not going to be difficult to
 
06:10:48.708 --> 06:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
keep in a notebook for the public to
 
06:10:48.718 --> 06:10:54.788 align:start position:0%
keep in a notebook for the public to
read

06:10:54.788 --> 06:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:57.030 --> 06:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
i feel like
 
06:10:59.590 --> 06:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
this also allows all parties to be on
 
06:11:01.670 --> 06:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
the same page when having discussions
 
06:11:05.430 --> 06:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
about curriculum so if i were to go to
 
06:11:07.190 --> 06:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
the school board and or school board
 
06:11:08.788 --> 06:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
member and try to talk to them about
 
06:11:11.190 --> 06:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum matters we're on the same
 
06:11:11.200 --> 06:11:12.230 align:start position:0%
curriculum matters we're on the same
page

06:11:12.230 --> 06:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
page
 
06:11:13.590 --> 06:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to they're
 
06:11:15.430 --> 06:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
not going to tell me that oh no we don't
 
06:11:15.440 --> 06:11:17.430 align:start position:0%
not going to tell me that oh no we don't
teach

06:11:17.430 --> 06:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
teach
 
06:11:19.190 --> 06:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
06:11:21.030 --> 06:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
latin or something
 
06:11:23.270 --> 06:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
we don't teach that at our schools
 
06:11:25.830 --> 06:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
because it will be well known it will be
 
06:11:27.830 --> 06:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
information that's easily available to
 
06:11:29.670 --> 06:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
every parent that that is what's in the
 
06:11:31.910 --> 06:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum so these conversations will
 
06:11:34.470 --> 06:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
be much easier to have with everyone on
 
06:11:39.430 --> 06:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:41.750 --> 06:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
this also will allow members of the
 
06:11:45.190 --> 06:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
public to compare and contrast
 
06:11:47.590 --> 06:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
so they can look at the curriculum used
 
06:11:49.830 --> 06:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
in their community if they think that
 
06:11:51.910 --> 06:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
their community is doing well they can
 
06:11:51.920 --> 06:11:52.708 align:start position:0%
their community is doing well they can
be

06:11:52.708 --> 06:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:11:55.670 --> 06:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
they will be proud of that if they think
 
06:11:57.430 --> 06:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
that another community is doing very
 
06:11:58.548 --> 06:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
well and they wish that their own
 
06:12:00.230 --> 06:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
community was doing that well they can
 
06:12:02.548 --> 06:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
think about what the other community is
 
06:12:04.628 --> 06:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
using and they can go and look at what
 
06:12:06.628 --> 06:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
the other community is using
 
06:12:08.150 --> 06:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
and make those comparisons and that's
 
06:12:10.708 --> 06:12:10.718 align:start position:0%
not just for parents but business owners
 
06:12:13.270 --> 06:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
could could do the same thing people who
 
06:12:14.310 --> 06:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
are just
 
06:12:16.708 --> 06:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about science
 
06:12:19.190 --> 06:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
could think about the best ways to
 
06:12:20.948 --> 06:12:20.958 align:start position:0%
improve science
 
06:12:26.150 --> 06:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:27.910 --> 06:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
who is concerned about uh
 
06:12:29.990 --> 06:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
test scores in a certain community could
 
06:12:31.830 --> 06:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
look at that and think about it i know
 
06:12:33.590 --> 06:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's not the whole story and i'm sure
 
06:12:36.390 --> 06:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
that experienced educators in this
 
06:12:38.708 --> 06:12:38.718 align:start position:0%
on this um
 
06:12:41.110 --> 06:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
committee will will know that and
 
06:12:42.948 --> 06:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
but it's it's something that we can all
 
06:12:45.350 --> 06:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
point to and understand have a a real
 
06:12:49.190 --> 06:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:51.030 --> 06:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
their taxpayer-funded schools it makes
 
06:12:53.830 --> 06:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
total sense to allow taxpayers to know
 
06:12:56.230 --> 06:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
what is taught in them
 
06:12:59.590 --> 06:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
this bill i i think is uh
 
06:13:01.830 --> 06:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
is a no-brainer and i actually don't see
 
06:13:04.150 --> 06:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
any reason why this cannot or should not
 
06:13:05.910 --> 06:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
be done and i've talked to many people
 
06:13:07.350 --> 06:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
about it and
 
06:13:09.030 --> 06:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
everyone i've talked to feels the same
 
06:13:10.390 --> 06:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
way they don't see a reason why this
 
06:13:12.948 --> 06:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
cannot be done or should not be done
 
06:13:15.190 --> 06:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
and that uh some people are surprised
 
06:13:17.270 --> 06:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
that it's not already done
 
06:13:17.280 --> 06:13:18.230 align:start position:0%
that it's not already done
and

06:13:18.230 --> 06:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:13:19.910 --> 06:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's the that is the only response i
 
06:13:23.510 --> 06:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
have gotten to this bill so far
 
06:13:25.350 --> 06:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
so i'd be happy to take questions and
 
06:13:27.110 --> 06:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
i'll answer them as best as i possibly
 
06:13:27.120 --> 06:13:28.470 align:start position:0%
i'll answer them as best as i possibly
can

06:13:28.470 --> 06:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:13:29.990 --> 06:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:13:32.628 --> 06:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
representative paul
 
06:13:34.070 --> 06:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:13:36.310 --> 06:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you have any idea
 
06:13:38.708 --> 06:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
how many schools don't already post
 
06:13:38.718 --> 06:13:40.230 align:start position:0%
how many schools don't already post
curriculum

06:13:40.230 --> 06:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
06:13:42.390 --> 06:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
no i don't know that but i know that
 
06:13:42.400 --> 06:13:44.150 align:start position:0%
no i don't know that but i know that
this

06:13:44.150 --> 06:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:13:44.160 --> 06:13:44.948 align:start position:0%
this
uh

06:13:44.948 --> 06:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:13:47.430 --> 06:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
that this does not already exist so it
 
06:13:49.910 --> 06:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
should be no no no problem to do this
 
06:13:49.920 --> 06:13:51.030 align:start position:0%
should be no no no problem to do this
now

06:13:51.030 --> 06:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:13:53.750 --> 06:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
and if it were to exist if this were to
 
06:13:55.350 --> 06:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
be made law
 
06:13:55.360 --> 06:13:56.788 align:start position:0%
be made law
then

06:13:56.788 --> 06:13:56.798 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:13:58.310 --> 06:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
it would be every school that is doing
 
06:14:00.230 --> 06:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
this and i think that would be that
 
06:14:01.750 --> 06:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
would be good for the entire state and
 
06:14:05.110 --> 06:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:07.030 --> 06:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative ellison thank you mr
 
06:14:09.190 --> 06:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking two questions
 
06:14:09.200 --> 06:14:10.150 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking two questions
actually

06:14:10.150 --> 06:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
actually
 
06:14:13.350 --> 06:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh one you keep referring to curriculum
 
06:14:16.310 --> 06:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
the the actual bill on line four talks
 
06:14:16.320 --> 06:14:17.110 align:start position:0%
the the actual bill on line four talks
about

06:14:17.110 --> 06:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:14:19.910 --> 06:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum course materials
 
06:14:19.920 --> 06:14:21.030 align:start position:0%
curriculum course materials
which

06:14:21.030 --> 06:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:14:22.948 --> 06:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily that doesn't
 
06:14:25.150 --> 06:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
encompass a curriculum but that's
 
06:14:42.788 --> 06:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:42.798 --> 06:14:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
itch

06:14:43.990 --> 06:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
itch
 
06:14:46.948 --> 06:14:46.958 align:start position:0%
this one off it should encompass
 
06:14:48.628 --> 06:14:48.638 align:start position:0%
the curriculum and what is taught and
 
06:14:50.708 --> 06:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
now it doesn't have to be the lesson
 
06:14:52.230 --> 06:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
plan in
 
06:14:54.948 --> 06:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
infinite detail
 
06:14:57.510 --> 06:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
but it a guideline that people know what
 
06:14:59.190 --> 06:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
is going to be taught if you have a
 
06:15:01.270 --> 06:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
child in the 11th grade you want to know
 
06:15:03.030 --> 06:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
what they're being taught in social
 
06:15:03.040 --> 06:15:04.150 align:start position:0%
what they're being taught in social
studies

06:15:04.150 --> 06:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
studies
 
06:15:05.750 --> 06:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
you don't have to know you don't have to
 
06:15:05.760 --> 06:15:06.788 align:start position:0%
you don't have to know you don't have to
get

06:15:06.788 --> 06:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:15:10.070 --> 06:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
five pages per week of the lesson plan
 
06:15:11.990 --> 06:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
but if you know that they're studying
 
06:15:14.628 --> 06:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
the vietnam war the civil war that would
 
06:15:16.470 --> 06:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
be very helpful to you to have a
 
06:15:20.070 --> 06:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
conversation about about the entirety of
 
06:15:22.628 --> 06:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
their the child's education
 
06:15:25.830 --> 06:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you follow up mr chairman
 
06:15:27.670 --> 06:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh second question
 
06:15:30.788 --> 06:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh this appears to apply to
 
06:15:32.708 --> 06:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
all classes all grade levels in the
 
06:15:35.270 --> 06:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
school system yes you you're expecting
 
06:15:38.150 --> 06:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
that the uh kindergarten teacher will
 
06:15:41.510 --> 06:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
have tell you how they're gonna teach
 
06:15:43.590 --> 06:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
addition and subtraction and reading and
 
06:15:45.350 --> 06:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
so on i mean we're not just talking
 
06:15:48.070 --> 06:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
about the vietnam war and social studies
 
06:15:50.150 --> 06:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
and so on we're talking about
 
06:15:52.310 --> 06:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
the kindergarten teacher as well is that
 
06:15:54.548 --> 06:15:54.558 align:start position:0%
your understanding sure i don't see any
 
06:15:56.230 --> 06:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
problem with that i taught my own
 
06:15:56.240 --> 06:15:57.190 align:start position:0%
problem with that i taught my own
children

06:15:57.190 --> 06:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:15:58.628 --> 06:15:58.638 align:start position:0%
and if you ask me any questions about
 
06:16:00.070 --> 06:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
what i was teaching them at any time i
 
06:16:02.230 --> 06:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
would be able to tell you first grade
 
06:16:03.990 --> 06:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
materials i can tell you what i taught
 
06:16:05.190 --> 06:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
them i
 
06:16:06.708 --> 06:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
was teaching them to read i was teaching
 
06:16:07.830 --> 06:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
them addition i was teaching them
 
06:16:10.150 --> 06:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
subtraction then as the later grades
 
06:16:13.030 --> 06:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
progressed i taught them more
 
06:16:15.510 --> 06:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
issues more more subjects
 
06:16:16.470 --> 06:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:16:18.788 --> 06:16:18.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative baum
 
06:16:20.628 --> 06:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:16:22.070 --> 06:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
06:16:23.990 --> 06:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
you said the comprehensive list of all
 
06:16:26.628 --> 06:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
curriculum course materials to me that
 
06:16:28.628 --> 06:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean lesson plan it means list
 
06:16:29.910 --> 06:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
of books
 
06:16:31.430 --> 06:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
and those that are going to be used
 
06:16:33.110 --> 06:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
because i know we had a problem in our
 
06:16:35.270 --> 06:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
school with what books were being used
 
06:16:37.030 --> 06:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
so is that what you really mean by
 
06:16:39.270 --> 06:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
promptiento's cost of materials
 
06:16:43.910 --> 06:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:49.830 --> 06:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:51.670 --> 06:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
hi thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:16:53.430 --> 06:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question i was just wondering
 
06:16:55.190 --> 06:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
if you could speak to
 
06:16:57.750 --> 06:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
the exp the expenditures uh
 
06:16:57.760 --> 06:16:59.590 align:start position:0%
the exp the expenditures uh
indeterminable

06:16:59.590 --> 06:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
06:17:02.150 --> 06:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
do you have a thought process on that
 
06:17:02.160 --> 06:17:03.190 align:start position:0%
do you have a thought process on that
okay

06:17:03.190 --> 06:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:17:05.430 --> 06:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
if i had to pull something out of my hat
 
06:17:07.510 --> 06:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
i would say five cents per page because
 
06:17:09.510 --> 06:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's how much it costs to get maybe
 
06:17:11.030 --> 06:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's 10 cents per page but that's how
 
06:17:13.110 --> 06:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
much a copy costs at my public library i
 
06:17:14.470 --> 06:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
haven't made a copy there for a long
 
06:17:14.480 --> 06:17:15.910 align:start position:0%
haven't made a copy there for a long
time

06:17:15.910 --> 06:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:17:17.670 --> 06:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
but there we go
 
06:17:17.680 --> 06:17:23.190 align:start position:0%
but there we go
yep

06:17:23.190 --> 06:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:24.788 --> 06:17:24.798 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
06:17:24.798 --> 06:17:26.788 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
representative

06:17:26.788 --> 06:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:17:28.948 --> 06:17:28.958 align:start position:0%
uh see none thank you very much
 
06:17:30.788 --> 06:17:30.798 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry question
 
06:17:33.030 --> 06:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry mr chair i was slow
 
06:17:35.590 --> 06:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
getting that hand up it's it's late it
 
06:17:37.670 --> 06:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
happens to me so representative i just
 
06:17:39.990 --> 06:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
want to piggyback a little bit on what
 
06:17:42.230 --> 06:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative ellison said about the
 
06:17:44.390 --> 06:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
difference between a curriculum outline
 
06:17:46.628 --> 06:17:46.638 align:start position:0%
and curriculum materials
 
06:17:49.430 --> 06:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's educational lingo but for those of
 
06:17:51.350 --> 06:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
us that have been in a classroom when we
 
06:17:51.360 --> 06:17:53.190 align:start position:0%
us that have been in a classroom when we
hear

06:17:53.190 --> 06:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
hear
 
06:17:56.230 --> 06:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum materials
 
06:17:57.670 --> 06:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
i think what you would find is that
 
06:17:59.510 --> 06:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
people are picturing
 
06:18:01.510 --> 06:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
worksheets and
 
06:18:04.948 --> 06:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
activity boxes and
 
06:18:07.830 --> 06:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
i noticed that your bill also requires
 
06:18:10.070 --> 06:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
that public academies and public
 
06:18:13.510 --> 06:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
charters go through the same exercise
 
06:18:15.590 --> 06:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
who would be responsible because those
 
06:18:18.150 --> 06:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
materials are going to be stored at the
 
06:18:22.070 --> 06:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
public sau office correct yes so
 
06:18:23.270 --> 06:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
06:18:26.788 --> 06:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
the charter or academy's responsibility
 
06:18:26.798 --> 06:18:28.150 align:start position:0%
the charter or academy's responsibility
to

06:18:28.150 --> 06:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:18:30.708 --> 06:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
get those things over there i i'm
 
06:18:33.110 --> 06:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering about the physical
 
06:18:35.670 --> 06:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
space limitations and whether or not
 
06:18:36.628 --> 06:18:36.638 align:start position:0%
they can
 
06:18:38.070 --> 06:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know if you're in manchester and
 
06:18:41.190 --> 06:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
there are four charter schools and a and
 
06:18:43.270 --> 06:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
an academy
 
06:18:44.788 --> 06:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
then what what do you what do you do
 
06:18:46.230 --> 06:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
with all that stuff
 
06:18:48.628 --> 06:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
i don't think that would be a problem
 
06:18:51.990 --> 06:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
any more than the library trustee
 
06:18:54.628 --> 06:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
minutes being kept in a notebook at the
 
06:18:58.390 --> 06:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
public library are a problem for space
 
06:19:00.390 --> 06:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
i don't see that that would be a pro i'm
 
06:19:02.548 --> 06:19:02.558 align:start position:0%
talking about a notebook it might be a
 
06:19:05.350 --> 06:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
large notebook the kind that we get we
 
06:19:07.910 --> 06:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
seem to accumulate as representatives
 
06:19:07.920 --> 06:19:08.948 align:start position:0%
seem to accumulate as representatives
over

06:19:08.948 --> 06:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
over
 
06:19:11.430 --> 06:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
by by may our notebook will be pretty
 
06:19:13.750 --> 06:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
large right with all our bills so this
 
06:19:15.910 --> 06:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
may be a large notebook or it may be
 
06:19:17.830 --> 06:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
they a collection of notebooks such as a
 
06:19:19.910 --> 06:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
notebook for the first grade and one for
 
06:19:21.350 --> 06:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
the second grade and the third grade and
 
06:19:21.360 --> 06:19:22.070 align:start position:0%
the second grade and the third grade and
then

06:19:22.070 --> 06:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:19:24.948 --> 06:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
elementary school and so on at different
 
06:19:27.590 --> 06:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
schools but i don't i don't i'm sorry
 
06:19:29.750 --> 06:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to be close to this thing um
 
06:19:31.510 --> 06:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see it would be
 
06:19:33.590 --> 06:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
an insurmountable problem space will not
 
06:19:36.948 --> 06:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
be an insurmountable problem for this
 
06:19:40.150 --> 06:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
could i just have a quick follow-up
 
06:19:42.548 --> 06:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
i would encourage you if you if you
 
06:19:44.548 --> 06:19:44.558 align:start position:0%
would too i'm looking at bedford's
 
06:19:46.628 --> 06:19:46.638 align:start position:0%
curriculum which is online
 
06:19:49.350 --> 06:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
and it's every time you hit a link it
 
06:19:52.070 --> 06:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
brings you to like six more pages of
 
06:19:55.190 --> 06:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
whatever it's that physical copy
 
06:19:56.868 --> 06:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:19:59.430 --> 06:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
i would just
 
06:20:02.468 --> 06:20:02.478 align:start position:0%
ask whether or not you might
 
06:20:05.430 --> 06:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
consider something other than a physical
 
06:20:05.440 --> 06:20:07.430 align:start position:0%
consider something other than a physical
copy

06:20:07.430 --> 06:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
copy
 
06:20:09.750 --> 06:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps a master or
 
06:20:12.390 --> 06:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
the ability to access it electronically
 
06:20:15.110 --> 06:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
at the superintendent's office well the
 
06:20:17.190 --> 06:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
the bill does say it can be on the
 
06:20:18.788 --> 06:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
website and
 
06:20:21.030 --> 06:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
and at the sau
 
06:20:22.628 --> 06:20:22.638 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to keep it as simple as
 
06:20:24.390 --> 06:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
possible and
 
06:20:27.510 --> 06:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
accessible by every person in the state
 
06:20:29.830 --> 06:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
so that would that would be physically
 
06:20:32.310 --> 06:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
located at the sau for simplicity
 
06:20:35.030 --> 06:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
purposes also we are we always consider
 
06:20:37.830 --> 06:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
that some communities don't have an
 
06:20:39.670 --> 06:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
online presence it's hard to imagine
 
06:20:42.150 --> 06:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
that nowadays but in the event there is
 
06:20:44.788 --> 06:20:44.798 align:start position:0%
a community that has a small elementary
 
06:20:47.030 --> 06:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
school and does not have a website for
 
06:20:47.040 --> 06:20:47.990 align:start position:0%
school and does not have a website for
that

06:20:47.990 --> 06:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:20:49.910 --> 06:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
then that is taken into consideration
 
06:20:52.150 --> 06:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
and everything is the same and and the
 
06:20:54.390 --> 06:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
expectation of where you can find this
 
06:20:56.310 --> 06:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
information would be the same in every
 
06:20:59.110 --> 06:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
single community so that so that
 
06:21:01.270 --> 06:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
citizens taxpayers residents parents
 
06:21:04.310 --> 06:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
everybody will be on the same page
 
06:21:05.750 --> 06:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
knowing where they can get the
 
06:21:05.760 --> 06:21:08.468 align:start position:0%

litchfield
 
06:22:35.510 --> 06:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
06:22:37.750 --> 06:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
relative alternative transportation for
 
06:22:40.390 --> 06:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
students for public schools and i know
 
06:22:43.350 --> 06:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
we have a member from the department of
 
06:22:46.708 --> 06:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
safety here to testify on that so with
 
06:22:49.750 --> 06:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
that thank you yes and we also have the
 
06:22:52.310 --> 06:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
department available here too
 
06:22:54.628 --> 06:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
today regarding any issues we may have
 
06:22:56.948 --> 06:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
regarding transportation and
 
06:22:59.510 --> 06:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are addressed there so at
 
06:23:01.670 --> 06:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
this point in time um
 
06:23:03.750 --> 06:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
does the department of safety have any
 
06:23:06.310 --> 06:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh information for us on this particular
 
06:23:06.320 --> 06:23:08.070 align:start position:0%
uh information for us on this particular
bill

06:23:08.070 --> 06:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:23:09.830 --> 06:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
there has been some
 
06:23:11.510 --> 06:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
questioning before
 
06:23:14.548 --> 06:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
uh use of volunteer private vehicles for
 
06:23:19.830 --> 06:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:21.270 --> 06:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
06:23:24.390 --> 06:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
oh come on up come on up
 
06:23:27.510 --> 06:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
oh he put on the card all right
 
06:23:30.788 --> 06:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:32.628 --> 06:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
i don't want to do that but
 
06:23:36.948 --> 06:23:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:39.510 --> 06:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:23:42.390 --> 06:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
this on okay yes welcome
 
06:23:44.390 --> 06:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
06:23:46.628 --> 06:23:46.638 align:start position:0%
my name is trooper first class gregory
 
06:23:49.030 --> 06:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
hildreth i am currently the supervisor
 
06:23:50.788 --> 06:23:50.798 align:start position:0%
of pupil transportation for the state of
 
06:23:51.910 --> 06:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire at the department of
 
06:23:51.920 --> 06:23:54.310 align:start position:0%
new hampshire at the department of
safety

06:23:54.310 --> 06:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
safety
 
06:23:57.030 --> 06:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
this bill uh i'm against it i have
 
06:23:58.708 --> 06:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
concerns over this
 
06:23:58.718 --> 06:23:59.830 align:start position:0%
concerns over this
basically

06:23:59.830 --> 06:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
basically
 
06:24:01.430 --> 06:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
in order for someone to drive a school
 
06:24:02.948 --> 06:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
bus in the state of new hampshire as
 
06:24:06.868 --> 06:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:08.548 --> 06:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
it gives clear
 
06:24:10.468 --> 06:24:10.478 align:start position:0%
information about what a school bus
 
06:24:12.548 --> 06:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
driver is and what they need to be and
 
06:24:14.628 --> 06:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
that's basically transporting
 
06:24:17.750 --> 06:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
via a municipal contract students to or
 
06:24:21.190 --> 06:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
from school or school related activities
 
06:24:24.150 --> 06:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
in this case this bill defines the part
 
06:24:25.350 --> 06:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
the people that will end up doing the
 
06:24:28.948 --> 06:24:28.958 align:start position:0%
driving as volunteers under the 189 law
 
06:24:31.270 --> 06:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
now that would put them in basically as
 
06:24:32.868 --> 06:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
a school employee
 
06:24:34.468 --> 06:24:34.478 align:start position:0%
and assuming they're going to be
 
06:24:34.478 --> 06:24:35.910 align:start position:0%
and assuming they're going to be
compensated

06:24:35.910 --> 06:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
compensated
 
06:24:37.350 --> 06:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
basically that would put them in a
 
06:24:39.830 --> 06:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
situation outside of the department of
 
06:24:42.548 --> 06:24:42.558 align:start position:0%
safety's oversight and regulation
 
06:24:44.468 --> 06:24:44.478 align:start position:0%
and allow them to do everything a school
 
06:24:46.868 --> 06:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
bus driver does without any of the
 
06:24:48.868 --> 06:24:48.878 align:start position:0%
safety yards or checks that my
 
06:24:51.110 --> 06:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
department puts into place so in new
 
06:24:53.350 --> 06:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire for a school bus driver that
 
06:24:55.990 --> 06:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
operates under 259.96
 
06:24:58.390 --> 06:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
they have to submit what's called a dsmv
 
06:25:01.750 --> 06:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
126 form it's a roster that is the first
 
06:25:04.230 --> 06:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
page that we receive for anybody that's
 
06:25:06.548 --> 06:25:06.558 align:start position:0%
going to drive for either a school or a
 
06:25:08.070 --> 06:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
company that's contracted with the
 
06:25:10.708 --> 06:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
school to drive and transport students
 
06:25:12.708 --> 06:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
i run background checks right now on
 
06:25:15.590 --> 06:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
them for via new hampshire and motor
 
06:25:17.990 --> 06:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle record checks to determine their
 
06:25:19.590 --> 06:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
fitness to drive
 
06:25:19.600 --> 06:25:20.868 align:start position:0%
fitness to drive
now

06:25:20.868 --> 06:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:25:22.468 --> 06:25:22.478 align:start position:0%
they are among if you see a school bus
 
06:25:23.990 --> 06:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
driver they are among the highest
 
06:25:26.230 --> 06:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
regulated drivers on the road i've had
 
06:25:28.390 --> 06:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
many cdl drivers that have done
 
06:25:29.990 --> 06:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
transportation that then want to take on
 
06:25:31.990 --> 06:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
a school bus job and they'll find that
 
06:25:33.430 --> 06:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
they find themselves denied for
 
06:25:35.030 --> 06:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
something and they ask us you know why
 
06:25:36.468 --> 06:25:36.478 align:start position:0%
was i denied i've been driving a you
 
06:25:38.628 --> 06:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
know hazmat or doing this for this long
 
06:25:40.390 --> 06:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's because we restrict and regulate
 
06:25:41.990 --> 06:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
these drivers so carefully to make sure
 
06:25:43.670 --> 06:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
the safest people out there to be
 
06:25:45.990 --> 06:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
driving we don't do this just once we do
 
06:25:47.590 --> 06:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
this annually and this is one of the
 
06:25:49.750 --> 06:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the current bill under
 
06:25:52.230 --> 06:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
the doe side they only run one
 
06:25:53.670 --> 06:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
fingerprint check
 
06:25:55.590 --> 06:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
and that's it they could run it for 30
 
06:25:57.430 --> 06:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
years and a school employee well
 
06:25:58.948 --> 06:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
everybody knows somebody you know just
 
06:26:00.868 --> 06:26:00.878 align:start position:0%
got checked back in 1990 doesn't mean
 
06:26:02.390 --> 06:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
you didn't do something in between i've
 
06:26:03.670 --> 06:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
come in across
 
06:26:06.390 --> 06:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
specific situations where
 
06:26:08.628 --> 06:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
people that were cleared last year then
 
06:26:11.350 --> 06:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
they get re-annually checked this year
 
06:26:12.788 --> 06:26:12.798 align:start position:0%
and now they've done something that you
 
06:26:15.030 --> 06:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
know is significant that we need to take
 
06:26:16.788 --> 06:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
away there so we continuously run checks
 
06:26:19.030 --> 06:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
on them additionally they also have to
 
06:26:20.868 --> 06:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
undergo a minimum of 10 hours of
 
06:26:20.878 --> 06:26:21.830 align:start position:0%
undergo a minimum of 10 hours of
training

06:26:21.830 --> 06:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
training
 
06:26:24.310 --> 06:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
operating a school bus uh the safety of
 
06:26:26.390 --> 06:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
operating and driving with kids
 
06:26:28.548 --> 06:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
and all kinds of curriculum associated
 
06:26:30.150 --> 06:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
with that again this bill would require
 
06:26:31.750 --> 06:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
none of that
 
06:26:31.760 --> 06:26:32.628 align:start position:0%
none of that
the

06:26:32.628 --> 06:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
additional parts of the vehicle against
 
06:26:37.110 --> 06:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
school buses the typical yellow buses
 
06:26:39.270 --> 06:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
you see out there that they compose a
 
06:26:41.110 --> 06:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
good number of the actual school buses
 
06:26:43.510 --> 06:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
on the road that fall under the vehicles
 
06:26:46.230 --> 06:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
that are authorized under the 1300 rules
 
06:26:49.430 --> 06:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
and again they're reinforced steel belts
 
06:26:51.590 --> 06:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
or bars around the uh the foot the hip
 
06:26:53.270 --> 06:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
the shoulder level for the normal school
 
06:26:54.948 --> 06:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
buses the short yellow buses all the way
 
06:26:58.390 --> 06:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
up to the big full-size flat nose buses
 
06:27:00.070 --> 06:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's also a significant number of
 
06:27:01.990 --> 06:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
regular passenger vehicles out there
 
06:27:03.430 --> 06:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
that are school buses they're called
 
06:27:06.150 --> 06:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
multi-passenger vehicles now
 
06:27:08.468 --> 06:27:08.478 align:start position:0%
we require not only a state safety
 
06:27:11.110 --> 06:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
inspection which this bill also requires
 
06:27:12.628 --> 06:27:12.638 align:start position:0%
but we also require school bus
 
06:27:14.468 --> 06:27:14.478 align:start position:0%
inspection on those vehicles and that's
 
06:27:15.990 --> 06:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
a center sticker that actually gets on
 
06:27:17.670 --> 06:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's a completely different inspection
 
06:27:18.788 --> 06:27:18.798 align:start position:0%
and it makes sure that all the
 
06:27:20.468 --> 06:27:20.478 align:start position:0%
requirements and equipment requirements
 
06:27:22.310 --> 06:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
that make these vehicles safer is
 
06:27:25.110 --> 06:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
present this bill requires none of that
 
06:27:27.190 --> 06:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
so no emerging medical clint required no
 
06:27:29.110 --> 06:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
seat belt cutter no body fluid spill
 
06:27:30.628 --> 06:27:30.638 align:start position:0%
kits no
 
06:27:33.350 --> 06:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
hazard warning devices again so this is
 
06:27:34.708 --> 06:27:34.718 align:start position:0%
just another example of some of the
 
06:27:36.310 --> 06:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
stuff that gets skipped over by this
 
06:27:36.320 --> 06:27:37.430 align:start position:0%
stuff that gets skipped over by this
bill

06:27:37.430 --> 06:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:27:38.948 --> 06:27:38.958 align:start position:0%
when this bill goes in and actually
 
06:27:40.390 --> 06:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
06:27:42.468 --> 06:27:42.478 align:start position:0%
the volunteers one of the concerning
 
06:27:44.628 --> 06:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
parts of the language in this bill
 
06:27:47.510 --> 06:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
is right under paragraph two
 
06:27:49.750 --> 06:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
it says students may be transported to
 
06:27:51.590 --> 06:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
and from school activities or to and
 
06:27:53.510 --> 06:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
from school when that school district
 
06:27:55.270 --> 06:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
cannot provide legally required
 
06:27:55.280 --> 06:27:56.548 align:start position:0%
cannot provide legally required
transportation

06:27:56.548 --> 06:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
06:27:58.468 --> 06:27:58.478 align:start position:0%
that's vague i feel like an open to
 
06:28:00.788 --> 06:28:00.798 align:start position:0%
interpretation you know what when they
 
06:28:02.390 --> 06:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
can't provide does that mean they simply
 
06:28:04.150 --> 06:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
don't budget for it and they don't want
 
06:28:05.910 --> 06:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
to use the available safer vehicles and
 
06:28:07.190 --> 06:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
drivers on the road and they decide
 
06:28:08.468 --> 06:28:08.478 align:start position:0%
we're just going to keep this in-house
 
06:28:10.150 --> 06:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
and operate our own
 
06:28:12.070 --> 06:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
you know substitute teachers the lunch
 
06:28:13.590 --> 06:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
lady whoever's going to end up going out
 
06:28:15.430 --> 06:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
and transporting kids in their vehicle
 
06:28:17.270 --> 06:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
via their own personal vehicle it
 
06:28:18.868 --> 06:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't require scaleless safety
 
06:28:20.390 --> 06:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
inspection doesn't require the extra
 
06:28:21.750 --> 06:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
hours of training annually it doesn't
 
06:28:24.310 --> 06:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
require the annual backup trucks so this
 
06:28:26.150 --> 06:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
is the major concern here is this is
 
06:28:27.990 --> 06:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
essentially a seesaw where you're taking
 
06:28:30.310 --> 06:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
safety at the highest and lowering that
 
06:28:31.670 --> 06:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
to lift the other side which would be
 
06:28:34.310 --> 06:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
for convenience i do understand there is
 
06:28:37.190 --> 06:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
a shortage of drivers and i certainly
 
06:28:38.948 --> 06:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
can appreciate the intent of this bill
 
06:28:40.708 --> 06:28:40.718 align:start position:0%
but i feel like this just opens a door
 
06:28:42.390 --> 06:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
to you know undercutting the current
 
06:28:45.910 --> 06:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
safer industry and operating outside of
 
06:28:48.230 --> 06:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
my regulation the department of safety
 
06:28:48.240 --> 06:28:49.590 align:start position:0%
my regulation the department of safety
and

06:28:49.590 --> 06:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:28:52.150 --> 06:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
things can happen uh you know people
 
06:28:54.230 --> 06:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
they end up transporting kids around
 
06:28:56.230 --> 06:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
things do happen and we'd like to keep
 
06:29:00.150 --> 06:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
the safest drivers possible on the road
 
06:29:01.830 --> 06:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd like to open myself to
 
06:29:03.990 --> 06:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much officer uh
 
06:29:06.310 --> 06:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
may i start with the first question i
 
06:29:08.230 --> 06:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
have i'm looking at the bill and i'm
 
06:29:11.190 --> 06:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
looking at lines 16 and 17.
 
06:29:13.110 --> 06:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
it says no school school district or
 
06:29:14.868 --> 06:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
school administrative union shall be
 
06:29:17.270 --> 06:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
held responsible for any loss damage or
 
06:29:20.868 --> 06:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
legal liability
 
06:29:23.270 --> 06:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
would that sentence alone
 
06:29:25.830 --> 06:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
exempt a school district
 
06:29:28.390 --> 06:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
who is using that to tr this mode of
 
06:29:28.400 --> 06:29:30.150 align:start position:0%
who is using that to tr this mode of
transportation

06:29:30.150 --> 06:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
06:29:33.270 --> 06:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
from liability from you know
 
06:29:35.750 --> 06:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm having a hard time believing that
 
06:29:37.510 --> 06:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i i have a lot of issues with
 
06:29:39.110 --> 06:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
this bill but one of the things is i
 
06:29:40.390 --> 06:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
mean i feel like that was just put in
 
06:29:43.110 --> 06:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
there to try and give the school an out
 
06:29:44.468 --> 06:29:44.478 align:start position:0%
in the end it's going to be put down on
 
06:29:45.910 --> 06:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
the private insurance that they're
 
06:29:47.910 --> 06:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
required to carry for this
 
06:29:51.030 --> 06:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
again i don't i just i i don't deal with
 
06:29:53.110 --> 06:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
the actual legislative law legal
 
06:29:54.548 --> 06:29:54.558 align:start position:0%
definitions and all that but what i end
 
06:29:56.548 --> 06:29:56.558 align:start position:0%
up seeing when i read this whole bill is
 
06:29:59.030 --> 06:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's basically a way to avoid a lot of
 
06:30:00.628 --> 06:30:00.638 align:start position:0%
the requirements and safeguards that are
 
06:30:02.948 --> 06:30:02.958 align:start position:0%
currently in place under my regulations
 
06:30:05.590 --> 06:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
which fall into the 259 laws and the
 
06:30:07.990 --> 06:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
rsafc 1300 rules because they're
 
06:30:09.350 --> 06:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
completely outside all the stuff that
 
06:30:12.310 --> 06:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
pertains is not in this bill yeah and
 
06:30:14.548 --> 06:30:14.558 align:start position:0%
that led to my you you approach a little
 
06:30:16.230 --> 06:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
bit on where i was going to go with this
 
06:30:16.240 --> 06:30:17.190 align:start position:0%
bit on where i was going to go with this
thing

06:30:17.190 --> 06:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
thing
 
06:30:17.200 --> 06:30:18.310 align:start position:0%
thing
um

06:30:18.310 --> 06:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:21.590 --> 06:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
you insure your car via through you know
 
06:30:24.628 --> 06:30:24.638 align:start position:0%
geico or any hartford any of them
 
06:30:27.350 --> 06:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
for purposes you sow state when you get
 
06:30:29.270 --> 06:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
that insurance policy
 
06:30:31.350 --> 06:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
now you're turning your vehicle into a
 
06:30:33.750 --> 06:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
school bus transporter
 
06:30:35.510 --> 06:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
type vehicle
 
06:30:36.948 --> 06:30:36.958 align:start position:0%
is that something you would have to
 
06:30:39.830 --> 06:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
modify your insurance policy for to say
 
06:30:41.910 --> 06:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
now we're using on a regular basis to do
 
06:30:43.670 --> 06:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
school business so there's a company
 
06:30:45.510 --> 06:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
tucker transportation they're basically
 
06:30:47.910 --> 06:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
a husband and wife team
 
06:30:49.030 --> 06:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
and they have i don't know if they have
 
06:30:50.708 --> 06:30:50.718 align:start position:0%
any other employees or just themselves
 
06:30:51.990 --> 06:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
but they have their own house that's
 
06:30:53.190 --> 06:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
where they work out of they have
 
06:30:54.948 --> 06:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are school bus certified
 
06:30:57.110 --> 06:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
they're standard type regular cars out
 
06:30:58.708 --> 06:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
there but again they meet all the
 
06:31:00.548 --> 06:31:00.558 align:start position:0%
requirements the vehicles pass a state
 
06:31:02.468 --> 06:31:02.478 align:start position:0%
safety inspection they carry the proper
 
06:31:04.230 --> 06:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
insurance that's required for this i
 
06:31:05.910 --> 06:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what the threshold is
 
06:31:07.350 --> 06:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i don't deal with that but
 
06:31:08.868 --> 06:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
i do know that they have to have special
 
06:31:11.430 --> 06:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
insurance in order to do this uh the
 
06:31:13.750 --> 06:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles themselves are checked annually
 
06:31:15.750 --> 06:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're also open to audit
 
06:31:17.110 --> 06:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
which might if there's any other
 
06:31:18.390 --> 06:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
complaints about the safety of the
 
06:31:19.990 --> 06:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle i can go out and actually look
 
06:31:21.270 --> 06:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
at these vehicles and make sure that
 
06:31:23.350 --> 06:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
they're you know safe vehicles in this
 
06:31:25.190 --> 06:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
bill i won't be able to do that it's
 
06:31:27.350 --> 06:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
outside of my regulation so they can be
 
06:31:29.030 --> 06:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
driving whatever they want to drive if
 
06:31:31.190 --> 06:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
they can pass a safety inspection and i
 
06:31:33.030 --> 06:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
can tell you working field enforcement
 
06:31:34.390 --> 06:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
06:31:35.990 --> 06:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
you can find a sticker for virtually
 
06:31:37.190 --> 06:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
anything if you go to the right place
 
06:31:38.390 --> 06:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have an entire
 
06:31:40.310 --> 06:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
division that's dedicated to dealing
 
06:31:42.468 --> 06:31:42.478 align:start position:0%
with these inspection stations so the
 
06:31:44.310 --> 06:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
school bus inspection stations are much
 
06:31:47.110 --> 06:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
more limited and uh
 
06:31:49.750 --> 06:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
their their expertise and uh is unique
 
06:31:51.430 --> 06:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
to these type of inspectors that's why
 
06:31:53.830 --> 06:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
we require the additional second sticker
 
06:31:55.350 --> 06:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions from the
 
06:31:59.030 --> 06:31:59.040 align:start position:0%

um
 
06:32:59.190 --> 06:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
we have seen
 
06:33:02.548 --> 06:33:02.558 align:start position:0%
bills and subsequent laws in which
 
06:33:05.350 --> 06:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
legislatures have decided to say you
 
06:33:08.948 --> 06:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
can't help hold someone accountable um
 
06:33:10.868 --> 06:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
i believe if you look at
 
06:33:10.878 --> 06:33:12.628 align:start position:0%
i believe if you look at
the

06:33:12.628 --> 06:33:12.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:33:15.990 --> 06:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
bullying law there was that
 
06:33:17.990 --> 06:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
language in there and that has since uh
 
06:33:20.230 --> 06:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
been repealed by this legislative body
 
06:33:22.150 --> 06:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
to allow um
 
06:33:25.030 --> 06:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
for school districts to to be sued
 
06:33:27.190 --> 06:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
so can it be done
 
06:33:29.750 --> 06:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes and we've proven that and the court
 
06:33:33.590 --> 06:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
upheld that legislative language however
 
06:33:35.910 --> 06:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
i will say looking at this language it
 
06:33:38.070 --> 06:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
does seem overly broad
 
06:33:40.628 --> 06:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
it seems overly broad
 
06:33:40.638 --> 06:33:42.070 align:start position:0%
it seems overly broad
and

06:33:42.070 --> 06:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:33:44.788 --> 06:33:44.798 align:start position:0%
for any loss damage or legal liability
 
06:33:47.430 --> 06:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
um is associated to what
 
06:33:47.440 --> 06:33:48.948 align:start position:0%
um is associated to what
right

06:33:48.948 --> 06:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:33:50.708 --> 06:33:50.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:33:57.830 --> 06:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:00.948 --> 06:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
it's easy to do uh so um
 
06:34:02.628 --> 06:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
i i think in the right set of
 
06:34:05.110 --> 06:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances and facts given this
 
06:34:07.510 --> 06:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
overly broad language in the hands of a
 
06:34:09.350 --> 06:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
competent attorney
 
06:34:11.350 --> 06:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
there would be a very good argument to
 
06:34:12.868 --> 06:34:12.878 align:start position:0%
be made
 
06:34:14.948 --> 06:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
and so yes when i look at this language
 
06:34:16.548 --> 06:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
similar to representative vlad and
 
06:34:23.110 --> 06:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:25.190 --> 06:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
06:34:27.670 --> 06:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
for the department of education
 
06:34:29.510 --> 06:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
not seeing any questions thank you very
 
06:34:31.750 --> 06:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
much thank you and i don't believe we
 
06:34:33.670 --> 06:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
have any other people signed up to
 
06:34:35.430 --> 06:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
testify no pink cards and that's the
 
06:34:37.030 --> 06:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
last one on the docket for
 
06:34:38.788 --> 06:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
06:34:41.350 --> 06:34:41.360 align:start position:0%

06:34:43.910 --> 06:34:43.920 align:start position:0%

06:34:46.070 --> 06:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i did not intend i should not have
 
06:34:48.390 --> 06:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
done that and i apologize accepted and i
 
06:34:50.468 --> 06:34:50.478 align:start position:0%
never even went that way of thinking
 
06:34:50.478 --> 06:34:52.548 align:start position:0%
never even went that way of thinking
anyways
