00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Okay.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm going to open the hearing on Senate Bill 227 and recess until 1130.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Thank you.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Thank you.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Thank you.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Thank you.

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Thank you.

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Thank you.

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Thank you.

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Thank you.

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Thank you.

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Thank you.

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Thank you.

17
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Thank you.

18
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Thank you.

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Thank you.

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Thank you.

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Thank you.

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Thank you.

23
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Thank you.

24
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Thank you.

25
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Thank you.

26
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Thank you.

27
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Thank you.

28
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Thank you.

29
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Thank you.

30
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Thank you.

31
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Thank you.

32
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Thank you.

33
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Thank you.

34
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Thank you.

35
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Thank you.

36
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:26.500
I'm going to go off the record and I'm going to say I appreciate you guys getting me out of my work upstairs.

37
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.500
Well, we'll come out of recess for Senate Bill 227.

38
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:46.000
We're going to wait a couple of minutes because we were just in full finance, and we've got to wait for the rest of the committee to show up.

39
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.500
So I'm in the finest military fashion.

40
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.000
We'll hurry up and wait.

41
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I think we're live streaming, so I don't see anything off color.

42
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
As we've been reminded, all mics are hot.

43
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Right.

44
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
GeoLine's had a field day in the last two years.

45
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.500
It was recorded sessions between the auto-captioning.

46
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.500
Oh, right.

47
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500
Holy cow, right?

48
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.500
I still call Pataparami the Pataparami.

49
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.000
Because that was just, it's like, you know, but a computer does it.

50
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You're kind of at the mercy of this, you know, intelligent software.

51
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And the pronunciation, right.

52
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It's not going to adapt to the New Hampshire accent.

53
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
No.

54
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I didn't bring my name tag.

55
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Nobody did.

56
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:59.500
And I think Division I will be actually in Division II room this afternoon at 2 o'clock for 409 because we were asked to take that over.

57
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.500
What are we doing this afternoon?

58
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:11.000
At 2 o'clock in the Division II room, we will be having a work session for 409.

59
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Is that a joint work session?

60
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
No, no.

61
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
She just asked if it was more in Division our lane rather than theirs.

62
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:38.500
Okay, so for 227, I have asked Mike Hoffman to see if the language can be amended as was suggested during full finance to include the probation, parole, corrections line personnel.

63
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:53.500
is there anything else that we want to do because what I'm going to do is if anybody has any anything else to add I'll be glad to hear it.

64
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.000
But my intention is to recess this.

65
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:11.500
If that's all the language you're going to change or if we want to change something else, then we can reconvene at 2 o'clock just to vote the amendment.

66
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.500
So, Representative.

67
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:31.000
As was mentioned, volunteers, EMT and fire volunteers, maybe if there could be some sort of explicit language, if people agree with that, that would definitely include them and take any ambiguity out of it.

68
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I don't know if that's needed or not, but that's my thoughts.

69
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.500
I've been involved in a case with the Department of Labor Thank you.

70
00:04:43.500 --> 00:05:14.000
include them and take any ambiguity out of it I don't know if that's needed or not but that's I've been I've been involved in a case with the Department of Labor in the past as a witness not not as a plaintiff I wasn't in trouble what am I trying the Department of Labor doesn't consider compensation part of employment.

71
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.500
If you say you're working for this town of Hampton as a volunteer firefighter, you're an employee.

72
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:30.000
If the town Hampton recognizes you as an employee, they don't have to pay anything.

73
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.500
So the actual compensation is not required.

74
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.500
So the compensatory remuneration is not part of the whole?

75
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.500
Not part of employment.

76
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.500
Thanks.

77
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.500
Yeah, Representative Griffin.

78
00:05:44.500 --> 00:06:24.000
I'm looking at line five, the end of line five, where they made a change with their amendment, I guess, is to say death by suicide shall be considered a work related cause of death right to me that that's it the person dies of suicide it's work related that isn't what I heard in the testimony in the other room well I heard that there was an investigation, and there's a determination made as part of that investigation.

79
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.500
Is that, that's how the process works?

80
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.500
No, come on up.

81
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.500
These are streamed.

82
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.500
So thank you, Representative Steve Pearson, Ruckingham District 6 Dairy.

83
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:44.000
I sit on the PTSD commission along with a couple of my colleagues behind me.

84
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:53.000
What happens is there's a single entity in the state of New Hampshire where this all goes to.

85
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.500
We actually addressed this in a meeting just three days ago.

86
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:08.500
I asked that question as to, you know, do I have different agencies that look at this to determine this?

87
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.500
It goes to the labor board, one group.

88
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.500
They focus on all of it.

89
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:24.000
So that procedure has to happen as far as determination, and they go through the whole process.

90
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000
This is not just snap the finger and we've skipped all the normal things.

91
00:07:31.000 --> 00:08:12.500
That's not how this's this works at all so that is very much part of the the process the other thing from a policy side since I'm in the hot seat when ED&A heard this when when we talked with the world the Corrections folks that was encompassing when we talked about Corrections officers they're asking for a clarification then it just has to do with specific references in 100 a that that does not change what we saw in policy at all.

92
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:21.000
That's how we processed it, if you will, as being all of the folks in that world.

93
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So there's no policy differentiation by just making a clarification, because that was the intent when it went through us.

94
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.500
So just so you know.

95
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.500
Okay.

96
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.500
Thank you.

97
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.500
Representative Leishman.

98
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.500
Thanks, Mr.

99
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.500
Chairman.

100
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.500
We had a House bill that we passed on here.

101
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.500
Correct.

102
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.500
Which is very similar.

103
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.500
How similar to this?

104
00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:00.000
So House Bill 91, Representative Abbess' bill, is similar but not...

105
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I don't have it in front of me.

106
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.500
It's the substantive action is the same.

107
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:17.000
This is just a little bit more specific than what 91, here we go, thank you, the 91 was.

108
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
This is, oh, this is the full shebango.

109
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:30.500
So 91, which I believe, are you asking, Representative, because of your amendments that were brought on to 91?

110
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:51.000
Because I see your, let yeah so so the amendment that's being asked for here in finance puts it more in line with what you did with your amendment in House Bill 91 specifically so the Corrections line personnel is the...

111
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.500
looks like the bulk of the difference.

112
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:59.500
So this would just put that back in line with...

113
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:09.000
So Representative Mooney was kind enough to show me some technology and I see the Senate interim studied 91.

114
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Yes, the Senate has put their full faith and weight, my understanding, with 227.

115
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Thanks.

116
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Thanks, Mr.

117
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Chairman.

118
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.500
Okay, just for the, yes, Representative Walz.

119
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:43.500
I'm sorry for being late, but as I was walking in and out, I think I heard Representative Irv saying, if I'm not right, that death by suicide shall be considered a work-related cause of death.

120
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.000
Is that what you were asking about?

121
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Yes, that's if I'm not right, that death by suicide shall be considered a work-related cause of death.

122
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.500
Is that what you were asking about?

123
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:19.500
Yes, that's what I'm asking about because the way I read that, no matter what the process is, those boards are going to have to go back to this law and the law says death by suicide shall be considered.

124
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.500
Right, considered.

125
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:35.500
It's not a presumption bill because considered I'm going to be as a lawyer I read this, and it doesn't say shall be looked at as a possible.

126
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:42.500
Shall be considered a cause of death is the same as shall be presumed.

127
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:52.500
And in this current wording, I believe that it basically says it shall be presumed as a cause of death.

128
00:11:52.500 --> 00:12:07.500
If we wanted to say considered a factor, I think we would need to amend it or considered it's a possible cause of death, we would need to amend it.

129
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:16.000
But honestly, I read this language as basically saying, like Representative Irv did, this is a presumption.

130
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:26.500
The PTSD Commission, I will tell you, is pretty adamant that the watering down of that will make this bill useless.

131
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:35.000
It's going to need to have some teeth as far as as far as how's that's worded.

132
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:53.500
And, you know, I appreciate your interpretation of the word considered, but I this there's other presumption bills that I've been involved with in my time here that have used much stronger language than the word considered.

133
00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:00.000
And again, the procedural part of this, it must go before the board.

134
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
There is an investigative process involved in this.

135
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And that doesn't change.

136
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
This does not eliminate that procedural part of the investigation.

137
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
But what you've done is taken the discretion away from the board.

138
00:13:17.000 --> 00:14:21.500
By using this language and effectively creating creating a presumption It may need to go before the board, but the board no longer has description to find otherwise We are forcing the board to recognize that this that suicide Is a absolute factor or the work part of folks in these services is An absolute factor in suicide that is what that is what this bill does it it forces them to acknowledge that and go through the process of that which currently they don't have to do so from my point of view I'm fine with this I'm fine if it said presumption I think when you've got a suicide there it's you know anybody who is a first responder in any form has psychological implications of that.

139
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:28.500
I don't care what form you're doing it in, you are affected by it.

140
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.500
I have no problem with this.

141
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:38.000
I just wanna make sure we as a committee understand what we're doing.

142
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:53.500
And the lawyer in me says that this is the same, maybe Representative would disagree, but the lawyer in me says this is creating a presumption, and which I'm fine with.

143
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.000
In all honesty, I'm fine with it.

144
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.500
I think we should be giving death benefits no matter what.

145
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.500
But we need to understand what we're doing.

146
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:11.000
How many things do we not all the lawyers?

147
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.500
But if I may, Mr.

148
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:23.500
Chair, as Representative Walts is saying, my memory of my Funk and Wangle, my favorite dictionary, considered as past tense.

149
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.500
It's an adjective.

150
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.000
It's something that has been done completed.

151
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.500
It's not a direction to do something.

152
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.000
It's something that's been done.

153
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
So as Representative Wall say, end of story.

154
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
It shall be considered part of the suicide.

155
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
So that's great.

156
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
That's the way it should be.

157
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Unfortunately, we can't, this sounds gauche, but it's just true.

158
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
You can't ask a suicide person what were the causes.

159
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
It's just anecdotal, but that's what we got.

160
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
You have something, please come up to the...

161
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
You've got to have a mic.

162
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.500
These days we're live streaming.

163
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:42.500
Everybody has to talk in a mic in listening Holly Stevens for the record I am the public policy director of NAMI New Hampshire and in listening to you speak I'm also an attorney and I think the what they're saying is just like if an officer has an accident in their cruiser, that that is considered a line of duty death.

164
00:16:42.500 --> 00:17:14.500
However, they're still going to do an investigation to see whether that was the proximate cause, because if they find out that maybe the officer was you know off-duty in their cruiser under the influence the Department of Labor could come back and say well you know that doesn't count or maybe they're on duty but you know so that the is still done.

165
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:24.000
This is just saying that just like being shot while you're on duty shall be considered a work-related death.

166
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
That suicide is just another one on those lists, on that list.

167
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:43.000
But I think the Department of Labor would still do their due diligence just as they would for any other death in the line of duty.

168
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Does that make sense?

169
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.500
It's just not what the language says.

170
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:54.000
I understand the procedure, but that's not what this language says.

171
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:05.500
My job is to look at the language before us, and the language before us says to me it basically creates a presumption.

172
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:18.000
So I would just argue if we're trying to do that, if that's what we're trying to do, then we need to have different language.

173
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
That's all I'm trying to say.

174
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:29.500
I, as I said all along, if we created the presumption, I would be fine with it.

175
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:39.500
I'm happy to give these line of duty deaths, but we also need to look at the language before us.

176
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:45.000
And to me, the language before us reads as a presumption.

177
00:18:45.000 --> 00:19:06.000
And I understand that the wording is ambiguous at best, but I was just looking back to the previous line, which talks about that they still have to look at whether the injuries are a direct or proximate cause of the death.

178
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:14.500
So I think that that's where the investigation comes in, but that's just my reading of it.

179
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:26.500
I will have to bounce the ball back to Representative Walz and say, if you want to change the language, this is your idea.

180
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.500
You've got to come up with the language.

181
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:35.500
I don't have a problem with it as it's written.

182
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:40.500
But if you want to change it, let me know.

183
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.500
Let us know.

184
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.500
I don't want to change it.

185
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:51.500
I just want to make sure the committee understands what they're doing.

186
00:19:51.500 --> 00:20:05.500
I am comfortable with this language, but my reading of it conflicts with the testimony, and I wanted to make sure the committee's doing it eyes wide open.

187
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.500
Okay.

188
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.000
By all means, I mean.

189
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.500
So the, thank you, thank you, Chairman.

190
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:31.000
The Department of Labor has a seat on the PTSD commission and was present for the meeting that we had not more than three days ago where we discussed in length the procedure of this.

191
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:40.000
They didn't raise any concerns about this doing what you're telling me you think it's going to do.

192
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:51.000
So they are still fully going through the process of the investigations, the procedures, looking at the causation and all of that.

193
00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:09.500
So I mean, if the Department of Labor had made an an objection to this, by all means, I would certainly be telling you as a matter of the Commission's findings, but it's just not there, so.

194
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.500
Okay, thank you.

195
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:16.000
Just so you'll know my intentions, I've asked Mr.

196
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.500
Hoffman to modify the language as recommended by corrections to include the additional functions that they outlined.

197
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:43.000
I did not include the juvenile side of it because I'm not that familiar with it and I don't know that we wanna be planting our big foot in their business not knowing how their processes are.

198
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:56.500
I just, now we're taking something that has to do with group two and applying it to a different group over here that is not group two.

199
00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:16.500
It's my understanding, so if you want to do that in subsequent legislation, by all means, but I think at this time we really have to look at this as a Group 2 issue and not other departments or functions.

200
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:21.000
Can we find out if JPPOs are Group 2?

201
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Because I think they may be.

202
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
They're not.

203
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
They're not?

204
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
We know that?

205
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Okay.

206
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Thanks.

207
00:22:34.000 --> 00:23:46.500
So with that said, we'll have an amendment by 2 o'clock, and Division I is in the Division II room at 2 o'clock, because we are going to have the work session on 409, not Division but it's posted to be in that yep yeah yeah go ahead Mike I believe that division two is working on 409 as we speak only because I got a request from one of the members of Division 2 for amendment and then I just touch base with Mickey well chairman said she wanted us to hear it but if we don't have to hear it that's good okay but so we'll reconvene still when do you think we can have the amendment I asked for it rush and at that time I thought we'd be Reconvening at 1 so hopefully we should be all set for 2 o'clock.

208
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:53.500
Well, we'll have yeah full finances Reconvening at 1 and 1 30 for hearings.

209
00:23:53.500 --> 00:24:15.000
So we'll recess this until 2 o'clock And consider the amendment to move this out of the work session and I apologize for 409 I The chairman the chair woman asked me to us to take it over but she changed her mind.

210
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
So All right, so we are recessed until 2 o'clock Thank you.

211
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:29.000
I still think that the language of the bill lies in the face of the testimony.

212
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.500
I mean, I don't care about the language of the bill.

213
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.500
I read it initially.

214
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:42.000
Well, I think it lies in the face of the testimony.

215
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Thank you.

216
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000

00:28:48.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Okay, so I'll open the work session on Senate Bill 371 and recess it until we are done with a vote on Senate bill 227 as soon as the balance of the committee shows up we'll have a vote It is on?

339
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Okay.

340
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:19.000
We'll just sit quietly and anybody out in the audience will think the sound's not working.

341
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Well, I guess technically we could hold a vote now.

342
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
I know.

343
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
I know.

344
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
I'm just joking.

345
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
I'm confused I know.

346
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
I'm just joking.

347
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Oh, thank you.

348
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Thank you.

349
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
We're taking a vote on 371?

350
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.500
No, we're taking a vote on 227.

351
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.500
Yeah, but I mean...

352
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.000
Oh, we'll vote on 371 eventually, yeah.

353
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Oh, okay.

354
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Yeah, there we go.

355
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.500
How was your coffee break?

356
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.500
They went to the post- Okay.

357
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.500
Mr.

358
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:07.500
Hoppin, you want to just see what happened with the amendment here?

359
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:34.500
When you look at this amendment number 1338 you'll see section 2 is the paragraph that was in 227 Senate bill 227 that came into the committee and the drafting attorneys clarified this by instead of adding corrections officers in Section 2, they actually included it as part of the definition of police officer.

360
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:44.000
And if this looks familiar, it is because it was also in House Bill 1319, which passed the House.

361
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:51.000
So we had House Bill 91 that passed the House and House Bill 1319.

362
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.500
I kept saying 91 earlier.

363
00:30:53.500 --> 00:31:04.000
So this is consistent with the House position and it's drafted a little bit differently than what you saw this morning.

364
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.500
But it includes everybody we talked about.

365
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:16.000
It includes all the corrections officers, probation and parole officers, and correctional line personnel in Group 2.

366
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Okay.

367
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
You got to turn your mic on, please.

368
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Is that another way of saying it includes everybody in group two?

369
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
I think so.

370
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.500
But it also includes some people who are in group one.

371
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.500
Who's in group one?

372
00:31:37.500 --> 00:32:53.500
Anybody that works in the correctional line personnel could conceivably in group one and not in group two a psychologist a uh yeah i knew somebody working as a psychologist at the prison i guess for some reason thought they were group two too but i guess they're not okay administrative people would be also group two okay i actually think because of the way number four is written meeting the definition of permanent policeman that it would be those individuals who have attended the academy and are in group two okay so maybe not necessarily the psychologist or the uh medical staff okay when we get to when we start slicing the cheese this thin yeah exactly it gets a little shaky okay i'll go on with that question yes certainly so this morning I thought the testimony was just to include all line personnel, not those limited to group two.

373
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.500
Am I wrong?

374
00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:00.500
I see Jay Ward shaking his head in the back.

375
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.500
Am I wrong, Jay?

376
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.500
Yeah.

377
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.500
Okay.

378
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:17.000
So it's only the people that were put into group two, and that was done about three or four years ago.

379
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.500
There was about 35 positions leaving that went over.

380
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:27.500
And so there are blind staff that are not in the police.

381
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.500
Okay.

382
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.500
Thank you.

383
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.000
You don't need the definition.

384
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.500
Thank you for correcting my faulty memory.

385
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.500
Okay.

386
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.500
Representative Griffin.

387
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.500
So, Mr.

388
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:50.500
Chairman, for the purposes of moving forward, I would like to move amendment 1330H.

389
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.500
Okay.

390
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.000
Do we have a second?

391
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Second by Representative Leishman.

392
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.500
If the clerk's ready, we could call the roll.

393
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.500
Second by.

394
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:08.000
This is to approve the amendment, not the bill.

395
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Okay.

396
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.500
And the motion is to...

397
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.500
Adopt amendment 1330.

398
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.500
Okay.

399
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.500
All right.

400
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.500
The chairman votes.

401
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.500

The clerk votes yes.

405
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.500
Representative Mooney.

406
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.500
Yes.

407
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.500
Representative Leishman.

408
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.500
Yes.

409
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.500
Representative Hatch is absent.

410
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.500
Representative Walz.

411
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.500
Yes.

412
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.500
Motion passes six to nothing Mr.

413
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.500
Chairman.

414
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:52.500
Okay, I entertain a motion for the bill as amended.

The amendment number is 2022-111330H.

425
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.500
If you're in favor, you vote affirmative, now you're voting negative.

426
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.500
I'm out of practice.

427
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.500
Okay, the chairman votes.

So I'm close the hearing on 227 and reopen the hearing on Senate bill.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.500
Senate bill.

438
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.500

439
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.500

440
00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.500

So I'm close the hearing on 227 and reopen the hearing on Senate bill.

446
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:22.500
so I to close the hearing on 227 and reopen the hearing on Senate Bill 371.

447
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:26.000
Okay, we heard testimony in full finance.

448
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Does anybody here want to add anything or make any additional comments?

449
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
You're welcome to say, if you like, please.

450
00:36:36.000 --> 00:37:09.000
we want to make sure we get it right thank you mr chairman Ben Frost from New Hampshire housing after the hearing in full finance I had a sidebar discussion with Adam Schmidt who is representative for the New Hampshire Association of Realtors, and he reminded me of the compromise nature of the legislation that created the lead fund in the 2019 biennial budget trailer bill.

451
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:36.000
And part of that compromise was concessions by property owner representatives yielding to the changed testing regime for lead paint poisoning in exchange for funding to do the work that's necessary or made in part necessary because of the increased incidences of properties going under order from the Department of Health and Human Services.

452
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
So additional funding is consistent with that compromise and would be welcome.

453
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Okay.

454
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:52.000
I spent several years in real estate and had many hours of instruction about lead paint.

455
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.500
So I'm very familiar with the topic.

456
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.500
Great.

457
00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.500
Any questions?

458
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.500
Say again?

459
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.000
You know more than me.

460
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Okay, thank you.

461
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Representative Leishman.

462
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Thank you, Mr.

463
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Chairman.

464
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
So, Mr.

465
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:43.500
Frost, I just had a quick question for you you since you seem to be very knowledgeable in this how many units are still out there do we know that have lead paint problems we just like touching the tip of the iceberg are we getting into the iceberg we are I don't have an accurate count for you.

466
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:50.000
We have something on the order of 500,000 residential units in the state.

467
00:38:50.000 --> 00:39:11.000
I could give you an estimate of the pre-78 based on the 1980 census, which would give you a pretty close estimate of the number of pre-78 structures or pre-78 housing units, which includes all units in a large residential apartment building.

468
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
We're talking about many.

469
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
I'm going to give a scale number here.

470
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.500
100,000, 200,000, and we're doing hundreds of units at a time.

471
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:27.500
So we are just touching the tip of the iceberg.

472
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.500
Thank you.

473
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.500
Thank you, Mr.

474
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.500
Chairman.

475
00:39:33.500 --> 00:40:04.500
Well, some of this remediation could have been executed by landlords because for a long period of time it was the landlord's responsibility to bring them up to speed so so and ultimately sir it is still the landlord's responsibility right except they get a little help from their friends right anyone else like to make a comment about senate bill 371.

476
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.500
Yeah.

477
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.500
Mr.

478
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:13.000
Chairman, I move that we approve Senate Bill 371.

479
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Okay.

480
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.500
Do I have a second?

481
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.500
Second by Representative Leishman.

482
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:24.000
When the clerk's ready, we can call the roll.

483
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
And if you're in favor, you'll say yes.

484
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.500

486
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.500

512
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.500
Mr.

513
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:35.000
Chairman, the vote is seven to nothing and passes.

514
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Okay.

515
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.500
Well, I think that concludes our business.

516
00:41:40.500 --> 00:42:02.500
I don't know when we'll meet next because we don't know how many more bills we're gonna get but thank you for your efforts and we won't see you this week maybe next week we're adjourned I know that's that's where it was posted.

517
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:06.000
We tried not getting your vote bill.

518
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.500
Right now, I don't think we'll be meeting because we don't have any additional bills.

519
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.500
Thank you.

520
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.500
Thank you.
