want to do make that move that's fine
 

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.350 align:start position:0%
want to do make that move that's fine
then<00:08:16.919><c> I</c><00:08:17.039><c> am</c><00:08:17.160><c> going</c><00:08:17.340><c> to</c><00:08:17.400><c> suggest</c><00:08:17.699><c> that</c><00:08:17.940><c> we</c><00:08:18.060><c> push</c>

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
then I am going to suggest that we push
 

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.930 align:start position:0%
then I am going to suggest that we push

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.270 align:start position:0%
back that last day to sign off to give
them<00:08:21.180><c> because</c><00:08:21.720><c> that's</c><00:08:22.199><c> what</c><00:08:22.440><c> gives</c><00:08:22.680><c> OLS</c>

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
them because that's what gives OLS
 

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.490 align:start position:0%
them because that's what gives OLS
heartburn<00:08:24.060><c> as</c><00:08:24.300><c> if</c><00:08:24.479><c> we</c><00:08:24.599><c> shorten</c><00:08:25.080><c> that</c><00:08:25.259><c> time</c>

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
um then I would suggest that we would
 

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.570 align:start position:0%
um then I would suggest that we would
need<00:08:36.240><c> to</c><00:08:36.360><c> go</c><00:08:36.539><c> back</c><00:08:36.659><c> on</c><00:08:36.959><c> the</c><00:08:37.140><c> third</c><00:08:37.380><c> uh</c><00:08:38.219><c> to</c><00:08:38.399><c> the</c>

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:41.459 align:start position:0%
which actually we can't do because
 

00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:43.430 align:start position:0%

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.110 align:start position:0%
question for the clerk yeah
how<00:09:01.440><c> would</c><00:09:01.620><c> it</c><00:09:01.740><c> be</c><00:09:01.800><c> if</c><00:09:01.980><c> we</c><00:09:02.100><c> extended</c><00:09:02.519><c> it</c><00:09:02.640><c> to</c><00:09:02.820><c> the</c>

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
how would it be if we extended it to the
 

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.610 align:start position:0%
how would it be if we extended it to the
18th<00:09:03.600><c> that</c><00:09:03.779><c> Monday</c>

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
18th that Monday
 

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.590 align:start position:0%
18th that Monday
that<00:09:05.519><c> way</c><00:09:05.640><c> they</c><00:09:05.760><c> get</c><00:09:05.880><c> a</c><00:09:06.060><c> weekend</c><00:09:06.120><c> to</c><00:09:06.420><c> finish</c>

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
that way they get a weekend to finish
 

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.070 align:start position:0%
that way they get a weekend to finish
over<00:09:06.839><c> and</c><00:09:07.200><c> finish</c><00:09:07.440><c> any</c><00:09:07.680><c> builds</c><00:09:08.220><c> and</c><00:09:08.940><c> uh</c>

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
over and finish any builds and uh
 

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.290 align:start position:0%
over and finish any builds and uh
would<00:09:10.500><c> that</c><00:09:10.620><c> make</c><00:09:10.800><c> it</c><00:09:10.920><c> much</c><00:09:11.040><c> simpler</c><00:09:11.399><c> for</c>

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
would that make it much simpler for
 

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.829 align:start position:0%
would that make it much simpler for
OLS<00:09:13.140><c> or</c><00:09:13.380><c> I</c><00:09:13.980><c> it's</c><00:09:14.399><c> it's</c><00:09:14.580><c> it's</c><00:09:14.640><c> entirely</c><00:09:15.360><c> within</c>

00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
