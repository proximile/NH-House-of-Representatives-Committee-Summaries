ah
 
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
call house rules committee to order
 
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
and the first thing on the agenda
 
00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
are we supposed to vote on the uh
 
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.729 align:start position:0%
are we supposed to vote on the uh
minutes

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay exactly circulated okay the motion
 
00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
before is to accept the minutes
 
00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
has given to us all in favor I don't
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
suppose eyes have it
 
00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 align:start position:0%
um the main reason we're meeting is to
 
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
approve the deadlines
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
for filing and uh
 
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.370 align:start position:0%
for filing and uh
September

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
Paul

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
Paul
 
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.870 align:start position:0%
Paul
oh

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 align:start position:0%
do you have a position I'm just going to
 
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
ask you if we could
 
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you I really am having a
 
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
hard time today
 
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.270 align:start position:0%
hard time today
um

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
technologically challenged
 
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.450 align:start position:0%
technologically challenged
um

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping we could consider extending
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
the last day to file lsrs uh from the
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
15th to
 
00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 align:start position:0%
is it the
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
23rd or 22nd 22nd so it would be a
 
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
two-week window rather than a one week
 
00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.570 align:start position:0%
two-week window rather than a one week
window

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
window
 
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.189 align:start position:0%
window
and

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
um it's it's solely because at that time
 
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
of year we've got lots of people who are
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
traveling we've got lots of people who
 
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
are fulfilling all the obligations that
 
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
they put off for the first half of the
 
00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 align:start position:0%
year or elective surgeries or medical
 
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
appointments or stuff like that
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
and having looked back as far as 2017
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
there's only once that we had a window
 
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
that was that short and that was two
 
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
and I just thought it would be more
 
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
convenient for people and it also might
 
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 align:start position:0%
help OLS spread things out a little bit
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
and then the final thing I will note is
 
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 align:start position:0%
that if we end on Friday September the
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
15th at 4 pm Rosh Hashanah starts at
 
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.029 align:start position:0%
15th at 4 pm Rosh Hashanah starts at
sundown

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
sundown
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
so I thought perhaps if we extended the
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
deadline to September 22nd then we would
 
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
not be getting into Yom Kippur which
 
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't start till the Monday
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
and that might
 
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.210 align:start position:0%
and that might
just

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 align:start position:0%
be a an accommodation that would be
 
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.150 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so
 
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to the to the deadlines um
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
I we did do this two years ago with the
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
one week we also did do it one time uh
 
00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 align:start position:0%
in in the recent past I think it was
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
2016. uh may have been 2017.
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
um but the
 
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
part of part of the overall totality
 
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
here is too is that we have actually now
 
00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
surpassed even last sessions
 
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
um historic record of retained bills we
 
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
have now retained 187 bills and that is
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
not even including all of the Senate
 
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
bills that are are still have yet to be
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
heard which as you know have to be acted
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
on in the second year session
 
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.730 align:start position:0%
on in the second year session
additionally

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
my concern and and I know representative
 
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
Weber will will talk about this when we
 
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
come back in the fall to look at the
 
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
springs that spring deadlines but my
 
00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
concern as well is
 
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
the second year traditionally you all
 
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
want to get out a little earlier than
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
the the legal deadline of June 30th as
 
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.430 align:start position:0%
the the legal deadline of June 30th as
well

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
um and I I am concerned about
 
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.029 align:start position:0%
um and I I am concerned about
um

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
more bills potentially being on filed on
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
top of
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
um the the additional normal second year
 
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.309 align:start position:0%
um the the additional normal second year
bills

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
in in keeping in mind of course that we
 
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.370 align:start position:0%
in in keeping in mind of course that we
now

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
um according to Dave I think it was
 
00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:50.699 align:start position:0%
something like 70 is he here
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I think 70 at least of the bills now
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
are filed through ask OLS
 
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
online format of email so uh that is a
 
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
an additional capability that we didn't
 
00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:07.259 align:start position:0%
really have pre-covered
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
um where ask OLS where they were taking
 
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
the filings in that regard so
 
00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
um the only other thing if if you do
 
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
want to do make that move that's fine
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
then I am going to suggest that we push
 
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
back that last day to sign off to give
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
them because that's what gives OLS
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
heartburn as if we shorten that time
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
frame so if you want to change
 
00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
um to the to the following Friday
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
which which is the 22nd
 
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
um then I would suggest that we would
 
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
need to go back on the third uh to the
 
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.649 align:start position:0%
need to go back on the third uh to the
10th

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:39.659 align:start position:0%
10th
 
00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:41.459 align:start position:0%
which actually we can't do because
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's a holiday because the 11th is is
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
Saturday this year so the observed
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
Veterans Day is is on Friday so that
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
question for the clerk yeah
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
how would it be if we extended it to the
 
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
18th that Monday
 
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
that way they get a weekend to finish
 
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
over and finish any builds and uh
 
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
would that make it much simpler for
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
OLS or I it's it's it's entirely within
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
Europe from your experience I I think if
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
we're my my only concern about OLS is
 
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
that they have the corresponding
 
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
length to to get that extra you know we
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
talked about because right now the way
 
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
this is drafted they have 30 days 30
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
actual working days
 
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
um between the last day to file off and
 
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
the last day to sign off
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
um and this is a concern more so in the
 
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
first year of the biennium with the
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
number of working days that they have
 
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
um 30 Dave was ecstatic when I suggested
 
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
there were you know when I gave them
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
this proposal for 30.
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
um so it whatever you want to do is fine
 
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
I would just say that we would need to
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
change that corresponding
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns is I think we've seen
 
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
a lot of bills come to the committee in
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
this last session
 
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
um where a lot of not a lot but some
 
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
sponsors didn't do the work they really
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
should have done to make sure they're in
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
a proper form for the committee because
 
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
it's not oh well that's just
 
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.790 align:start position:0%
it's not oh well that's just
responsibility

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
to rebuild the engine with the car but
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
they'll tune it up a bit but they won't
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
rebuild it and uh maybe with this extra
 
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
weekend that give members a chance to
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
actually work on their bills and keep
 
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
them in the correct form so that we
 
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
don't have committees uh swapped with
 
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
amendments coming in to try to uh
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
put them in proper shape that's just a
 
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.850 align:start position:0%
put them in proper shape that's just a
comment

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
no comment I don't disagree
 
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:51.769 align:start position:0%
no comment I don't disagree
oh

00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
I think the one week is fine four days
 
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that's when you're
 
00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.220 align:start position:0%
sending the email right all your work
 
00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
and your research should have been done
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
in the months before that so we're just
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
talking about the deadline to get the
 
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
emails and the requests and and as far
 
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
as getting the bugs out of the bill
 
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
that's the deadline for sign off right
 
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
there's a back and forth so you get the
 
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
bill back from OLS and you go oh no this
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
isn't right or they raise an issue with
 
00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
it and that back and forth happens
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
through all of October and maybe even
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
the last week of September that just
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
seems like it's a sufficient amount of
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
time to me
 
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
I also don't want people filing 800
 
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:38.990 align:start position:0%
I also don't want people filing 800
bills

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
in a Weber
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
this is really more of an inquiry I
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
don't think we had any less bills when
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:49.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:56.459 align:start position:0%
it's it's tough to say I
 
00:11:56.459 --> 00:11:57.829 align:start position:0%
it's it's tough to say I
somewhat

00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
um but again I I really want to stress
 
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.269 align:start position:0%
um but again I I really want to stress
that

00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
what's coming in the second year is
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
really is is what is going to be
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
important because in terms of what we
 
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
have for time
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
um you know if if you want to go right
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
to the end of June which is great for me
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
because that gives us more time to build
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
in that flexibility but the more
 
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.850 align:start position:0%
in that flexibility but the more
um

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
the longer you leave a window open for
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
filing I think there's going to be more
 
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
people that say oh well I didn't think
 
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
of this one a week ago but hey maybe
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll take a stab at it this time I
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
don't know I
 
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
I think you are more prone to the longer
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
the session is open the the more lsrs
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
you'll have
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
but again that's
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's for you all is the policy makers
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
to decide and I would just say uh to
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
point I this is just deadlines I we we
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
are really hoping this doesn't become a
 
00:12:51.360 --> 00:13:00.530 align:start position:0%
are really hoping this doesn't become a
football

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry did you make a formal uh
 
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:22.690 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry did you make a formal uh
motion

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:22.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
nothing's the last one
 
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
I thought it was was it one
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:18.769 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:22.430 align:start position:0%
 
no Smith

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.710 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.629 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:26.670 align:start position:0%
no
no

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
no

no
[Music]

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.490 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:42.829 align:start position:0%

yes

00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
we're back to the original
 
00:14:45.959 --> 00:14:49.009 align:start position:0%
we're back to the original
proposal

00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:49.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.949 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
the motion is to accept the
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
deadlines that we have before us
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
which is September 11th September 15th
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
November 3rd November 17th and January
 
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.670 align:start position:0%
November 3rd November 17th and January
4.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
4.
 
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.050 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:45.050 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
is there any other business to come
 
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I was just um I'm just
 
00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
sort of thinking um not as a preemptive
 
00:15:58.009 --> 00:15:58.019 align:start position:0%
thing because we'll need to come back in
 
00:15:59.930 --> 00:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
the in sort of the winter time frame
 
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
anyway but I I know that uh
 
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
we've talked about it before so I wasn't
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
sure if um we might want to entertain uh
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
at this time a preliminary approval for
 
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:17.459 align:start position:0%
statutory study committees to have their
 
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
bills filed after the reporting deadline
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
because that will follow after our
 
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
filing deadline and this is something
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
representative Weber we usually talk
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
about so I I just thought that if you
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring that up now we could do
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
that sort of preemptively
 
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
I would be glad to make a motion so that
 
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
we don't have to deal with it later on
 
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
that um any statutory or study committee
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's has a filing deadline after our
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
after our filing period closes is
 
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
able to file legislation in in
 
00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:55.019 align:start position:0%
connection with a majority report I'm
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
sure the clerk has the motion as we've
 
00:16:59.449 --> 00:16:59.459 align:start position:0%
made it over the years and we can just
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
take care of it now and not have to have
 
00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:02.389 align:start position:0%
take care of it now and not have to have
people

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
running around trying to figure it out
 
00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:09.409 align:start position:0%
running around trying to figure it out
later

00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:09.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.689 --> 00:17:10.699 align:start position:0%
we've got language
 
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339 align:start position:0%
yes sir it's essentially it almost
 
00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:26.030 align:start position:0%
yes sir it's essentially it almost
verbena

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.409 --> 00:17:29.419 align:start position:0%
okay and I'm assuming that's a emotion
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%

Weber other business section I just also
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
when the calendar is set for for next
 
00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:12.169 align:start position:0%

term
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
um when when we said it this term
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
crossover was already set and so we
 
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
couldn't change that so I just plead
 
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
when you are negotiating with the Senate
 
00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:27.419 align:start position:0%
to put another week on our end of the
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
calendar in a shorter term on their end
 
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299 align:start position:0%
of the calendar because uh our bills
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
were really squeezed this term and you
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
know having had I think
 
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
60 or 70 bills in committee for the very
 
00:18:47.289 --> 00:18:47.299 align:start position:0%
shortened period of time this term and
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
then you know my committee has 16 bills
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
from now till May uh it I think it would
 
00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
be really helpful to house committees
 
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
that tend to be more rigorous in delving
 
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
into the matter in in bills to have as
 
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:06.299 align:start position:0%
much time as you can buy from us from
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm just putting that down there now
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
it was it was really short this time and
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh as you know uh the bills that are the
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
biggest the most complicated and have
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
the biggest fiscal notes are the ones
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
that always come out at the end and then
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
they're due and we had about three weeks
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
Max to deal with some of those bills
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
which were complex
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
so I would I would hope that if and it
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
wasn't anything we could do on our end
 
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
discussion for another day
 
00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:45.190 align:start position:0%
discussion for another day
great

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:48.539 align:start position:0%
I have no emotions you'll be glad to
 
00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:49.789 align:start position:0%
I have no emotions you'll be glad to
know

00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
okay uh is any other business
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
boy nobody wants to do anything today so
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
